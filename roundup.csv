0,"Infections remain high in Wales but fall in other UK countries
The percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) fell from record high levels in England in the latest week.
In the week ending 9 April 2022, infections remain high in Wales and continue to fall in Scotland. Infections also fell in Northern Ireland.
The estimated number of people living in private households (not in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments) that had COVID-19 in the most recent week was:
 - 3,773,800 people (1 in 14) in England
 - 231,900 people (1 in 13) in Wales
 - 95,900 people (1 in 19) in Northern Ireland
 - 314,800 people (1 in 17) in Scotland
In England, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in all age groups except those in School Year 7 to School Year 11 and those aged 70 and over, for which the trend was uncertain in the week ending 9 April 2022

1,"No evidence suicides increased during the COVID-19 pandemic
Adjusting for age, the suicide rate in England and Wales between April and December 2020 was 9.8 deaths per 100,000 people.
This was statistically significantly lower than the same period in the years 2018 and 2019, but in line with the rate in 2017.
The fall was mainly driven by a decrease in male suicides, which were statistically significantly lower (14.8 per 100,000) compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019.
A total of 3,828 suicides occurred during this period – 9.2% fewer than the same period in 2019 and 4.7% fewer than the five-year average (2015 to 2019).
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsfromsuicidethatoccurredinenglandandwales/apriltodecember2020,"3,828 suicides occurred between April and December 2020 in England and Wales, equivalent to an age-standardised mortality rate of 9.8 deaths per 100,000 people; this is statistically significantly lower than the same period in 2019 and 2018, but statistically similar to 2017.
The male suicide rate (14.8 deaths per 100,000 males) was statistically significantly lower than in the same period between 2018 and 2019, whereas the female rate (5.0 deaths per 100,000 females) showed no statistically significant change.
Between April and December 2020, age-specific suicide rates in England and Wales statistically significantly decreased for those aged 30 to 39 years from the same period in 2019.
Coroners' investigations result in suicide registration delays and were further disrupted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; while our provisional data for 2020 suicides will be underestimates, late registrations will not fully explain the decrease because most suicides for this period will now be registered.

2,"Retail and recreation visits remain below pre-COVID-19 levels
The number of visits to “grocery and pharmacy” locations in the UK fell by 2%, “retail stores and recreation areas” by 1% and “workplaces” by 4% in the week to 8 April 2022.
Google Mobility data show that the seven-day rolling average of visits to retail and recreation locations in the week to 8 April 2022 was 1% lower than in the previous week. Google Mobility data provide an indicator of changes in the volume of visits to different location types compared with a pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) baseline; in the week to 8 April 2022 they were 16% below levels seen prior to the coronavirus pandemic.
In other consumer spending indicators, most measures were down in the latest week. Transactions at Pret A Manger stores mostly decreased in the latest week, while UK seated diner numbers fell by 2 percentage points. During the same period in Manchester, Pret A Manger transactions and seated diner numbers fell by 22 and 13 percentage points, respectively.
Visits to all location categories were down in the most recent week. Meanwhile, UK spending on credit and debit cards increased slightly, in part driven by a 6 percentage point increase in “work-related” spending, which includes road fuel spending.

3,"Vaccinated remain less likely to test positive for COVID-19
Most people in the UK who reported having been vaccinated against the coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to be less likely to test positive for the virus than those who reported not being vaccinated in the fortnight ending 26 March 2022.
Those who had already been infected with COVID-19 continued to be less likely to test positive than those who had not experienced a prior infection in the fortnight ending 26 March 2022.

6,"1 in 37 people in the UK have long COVID
An estimated 1.7 million people living in private households in the UK were experiencing self-reported long COVID as of 5 March 2022.
This is around 2.7% of the population, or 1 in every 37 people, with symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after the first suspected coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that were not explained by something else.
Of those, 1.2 million people (69%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously, 784,000 (45%) at least one year previously and 74,000 (4%) at least two years previously.
Fatigue continued to be the most common symptom reported as part of individuals' experience of long COVID (51% of those with self-reported long COVID), followed by shortness of breath (34%), loss of smell (28%), and muscle ache (24%).

The estimates presented in this analysis relate to self-reported long COVID, as experienced by study participants who responded to a representative survey, rather than clinically diagnosed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 syndrome in the full population.
Of people with self-reported long COVID, 422,000 (24%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 less than 12 weeks previously, 1.2 million people (69%) at least 12 weeks previously, 784,000 (45%) at least one year previously and 74,000 (4%) at least two years previously.
Of people with self-reported long COVID, 561,000 (33%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 before Alpha became the main variant; this figure was 253,000 (15%) in the Alpha period, 470,000 (27%) in the Delta period, and 334,000 (19%) in the Omicron period.
Long COVID symptoms adversely affected the day-to-day activities of 1.1 million people (67% of those with self-reported long COVID), with 322,000 (19%) reporting that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been ""limited a lot"".
Fatigue continued to be the most common symptom reported as part of individuals' experience of long COVID (51% of those with self-reported long COVID), followed by shortness of breath (34%), loss of smell (28%), and muscle ache (24%).
As a proportion of the UK population, prevalence of self-reported long COVID was greatest in people aged 35 to 49 years, females, people living in more deprived areas, those working in social care, teaching and education or health care, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability.

7,"COVID-19 death rates higher for many ethnic minorities during Omicron
Rates of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) remained highest among many ethnic minority groups while the Omicron variant has been dominant. 
Between 10 January and 16 February 2022, rates of deaths involving COVID-19 were highest for the Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic groups. This is similar to patterns observed before Omicron became the main variant. 
Since Omicron became the main variant, men in the Bangladeshi ethnic group had the highest rate of death involving COVID-19, 2.7 times higher than men in the White British ethnic group, followed by Pakistani men (2.2 times) and Black Caribbean men (1.6 times). 
Women in the Pakistani ethnic group had the highest rate of death involving COVID-19, 2.5 times higher than women in the White British ethnic group, followed by Bangladeshi women (1.9 times) and women in the Mixed ethnic group (1.4 times). 
Since the pandemic began, patterns in death rates from all causes have been reversed among some ethnic groups. 
For example, all-cause mortality rates during the pandemic (24 January 2020 to 16 February 2022), were higher for Bangladeshi men and women, Black Caribbean men and Pakistani men compared to the White British group. 
This differs from pre-pandemic all-cause mortality rates which were highest for the White British and Mixed ethnic groups.

Between 10 January 2022 and 16 February 2022 (when Omicron was the main variant), rates of deaths involving COVID-19 were higher for many ethnic minority groups compared with the White British group and highest for the Bangladeshi and Pakistani groups (similar to patterns observed earlier in the third wave of the pandemic, before Omicron became the main variant).
Since the start of the period when Omicron was the main variant, males in the Bangladeshi ethnic group had the highest rate of death involving COVID-19, 2.7 times higher than males in the White British ethnic group; this was followed by Pakistani males (2.2 times) and Black Caribbean males (1.6 times); females in the Pakistani ethnic group had the highest rate of death involving COVID-19, 2.5 times higher than females in the White British ethnic group, followed by Bangladeshi females (1.9 times) and females in the Mixed ethnic group (1.4 times).
All-cause mortality rates for the entire period since the coronavirus pandemic began (24 January 2020 to 16 February 2022) were higher for males and females in the Bangladeshi ethnic group and males in the Black Caribbean and Pakistani ethnic groups compared with the White British ethnic group; this differs from pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic all-cause mortality rates, which were highest for the White British and Mixed ethnic groups compared with all other ethnic minority groups.
Although the low number of deaths in this short study period since Omicron became the main variant makes it difficult to assess the statistical significance of comparisons between groups, several main patterns are similar to those observed earlier in the third wave of the pandemic before Omicron became the main variant; in the future analyses over longer time periods with more data should allow for more precise estimates.

8,"Well-being levels out across all measures
While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted people’s reporting of their personal well-being, during the periods Quarter 2 (Apr to Jun) 2021 and Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2021 there has been little change to well-being.
During periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, both males and females saw an increase in anxiety and a reduction in life satisfaction, feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile, and happiness.
Our previous pre-pandemic analysis has shown females have the same or higher life satisfaction and happiness than males.
However, females reported lower levels of life satisfaction than males in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 and Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021, and lower happiness than males in Quarter 2 2020 (Apr to Jun), Quarter 4 2020, and Quarter 1 2021.
The declines in life satisfaction and happiness largely recovered by Quarter 2 2021 for both sexes. There was no significant change in these indicators for either sex during Quarter 3 2021, where there was also no longer a significant difference between the sexes.
For males, happiness scores in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 2021 and life satisfaction scores in Quarter 3 2021 returned to levels seen in corresponding 2019 periods.

11,"COVID-19 caused a larger impact on spending than the 2008 recession
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused a larger impact on household spending in the UK than the 2008 financial crisis.
Unprecedented public health measures during the pandemic caused an uneven fall in spending on goods and services. Reduced spending in restaurants, hotels and transport services were the main drivers for the overall fall in spending, along with changes in the ways goods and services were consumed following the start of the recovery from the pandemic. 
New insights from card spending transaction data show that the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant in late 2021 led to relatively lower levels of spending in pubs, restaurants and fast-food venues along with entertainment, and travel and hotels. Meanwhile there was a relative increase in spending on food and drink.
During the first two quarters of the pandemic, household spending fell 22.2% because of the introduction of lockdown and other public health restrictions, which particularly impacted “social spending”, such as restaurants and cafes, recreation and culture. Household spending recovered 19.6% in the following quarter and had almost returned to pre-coronavirus levels after two years following the pandemic. Following the financial crisis, household spending took over five years to recover.

Most UK residents (85%) returning from abroad said that they found it “easy” or “very easy” to follow the coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions in the country they had visited. The main reason cited by those who struggled with restrictions was that the information was “difficult to follow, or overly restrictive”.
Data collected in February 2022 also suggest that most travellers arriving in the UK think that having a coronavirus test prior to arrival is important. About 69% of UK residents and 78% of overseas residents said it was either “very important” or “quite important” for safety.
Three-quarters of travelers (75% of UK and 78% of overseas residents) said that the wearing of face coverings made them feel safe during their journey into the UK. Three-quarters of travelers also said that the availability of hand sanitizer during their journey also made them feel safe (74% of UK and 75% of overseas residents).
In February 2022, most UK residents (91%) and overseas residents (88%) arriving in the UK said they had received at least two COVID-19 vaccinations. Two in three UK residents and half of overseas residents arriving in the UK had received more than two COVID-19 vaccinations.

13,"Well-being levels out across all measures
While the covid-19 pandemic has impacted people’s reporting of their personal well-being, during the periods Quarter 2 (Apr to Jun) 2021 and Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2021 there has been little change to well-being.
During periods of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, both males and females saw an increase in anxiety and a reduction in life satisfaction, feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile, and happiness.
Our previous pre-pandemic analysis has shown females have the same or higher life satisfaction and happiness than males.
However, females reported lower levels of life satisfaction than males in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 and Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021, and lower happiness than males in Quarter 2 2020 (Apr to Jun), Quarter 4 2020, and Quarter 1 2021.
The declines in life satisfaction and happiness largely recovered by Quarter 2 2021 for both sexes. There was no significant change in these indicators for either sex during Quarter 3 2021, where there was also no longer a significant difference between the sexes.
For males, happiness scores in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 2021 and life satisfaction scores in Quarter 3 2021 returned to levels seen in corresponding 2019 periods.
For females, Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 (Jul to Sept) 2021, happiness scores returned to levels seen in corresponding 2019 periods, but life satisfaction remained below levels seen in corresponding 2019 periods.

15,"COVID-19 infections highest in England and Wales since survey began
The percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to rise in England and Wales and is estimated to be at the highest level since the Coronavirus Infection Survey began.
In the week ending 26 March 2022, an estimated 4,122,700 people in England (7.56%) and 212,000 people in Wales (6.97%) are estimated to have had COVID-19.
The previous highest levels in these countries were 6.85% in England in the week to 6 January 2022, and 6.35% in Wales in the week to 19 March 2022.
Trends in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the latest week are less certain.

17,"Vaccination coverage highest among health professionals
As of 28 February 2022, 74.5% of adults aged 18 to 64 years who were employed had received three coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations and 7.2% were unvaccinated. 
The occupation groups with the highest proportion of people who had received three vaccinations were health professionals (84.7%) and teaching and other educational professionals (83.6%). 
However, there was large variation between occupations. Within the health professionals group, 93.3% of specialist medical practitioners had received three vaccinations, compared with 71.9% of therapy professionals not elsewhere classified.

18,"COVID-19 antibody prevalence increases in school pupils
Coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies were detected in 96.6% of secondary and 62.4% of primary school pupils in England during Round 2 of coronavirus Schools Infection Survey (SIS) in the academic year ending 2022.
The SIS found that antibody prevalence was significantly higher in Round 2 (January to February) than Round 1 (November to December) for both primary and secondary school pupils. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence continues to steadily increase by age for all pupils.
Antibody testing in Round 2 took place while c oronavirus cases in England were increasing, especially among school-aged children, because of the Omicron variant (declared a variant of concern on 27 November 2021). It is likely that antibody prevalence is higher in Round 2 than Round 1 because of both an increase in infections in the community and the continuing vaccination programme for secondary school-aged pupils.
Of secondary school pupils tested in Round 2, 46.6% had received at least one vaccination dose at least 14 days before their antibody test. No primary school pupils tested in Round 2 were vaccinated.

21,"Child victims of modern slavery and the coronavirus
The number of child victims of modern slavery identified by the police and through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) continues to increase. 
However, in the latest year we have seen falls in potential victims indicated by other data sources. This could be due to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdown restrictions and makes measuring the underlying number of child victims even more challenging.
Modern slavery covers all forms of slavery, human trafficking and exploitation. It is a hidden crime with victims often unable to come forward due to fear or shame, or because they are unable to leave their situation.
This is our first attempt to bring together data sources on child victims of modern slavery.
In the year ending December 2021, the number of referrals of children to the NRM increased by 9% compared with the previous year (from 5,028 to 5,468), continuing an upward trend over time. 
Changes in police recording practices and the coronavirus pandemic have likely affected the number of child victims identified in recent years. Other data sources show:
 - an increase of 27% (to 3,239) in the number of modern slavery offences involving a child victim recorded by the police in England and Wales in the year ending March 2021 compared with the previous year
 - 16,830 episodes of need for child sexual exploitation and 2,710 for trafficking identified by the Department for Education’s children in need census in the year ending March 2021, both representing a 10% decrease from the previous year; likely the result of a fall in referrals from schools during the pandemic
 - a 43% decrease in the number of potential child victims reported to the Modern Slavery and Exploitation Helpline in the year ending December 2021 compared with the previous year

Warning: This release contains themes that some may find distressing



Modern slavery is an umbrella term for all forms of slavery, human trafficking and exploitation. It is a hidden crime with victims often unable to come forward due to fear or shame, or because they are unable to leave their situation. Consequently, reporting is partial and quantifying the number of victims is challenging.


It’s on your doorstep. You just don’t see it.

- male victim of criminal exploitation, aged 16 years

There is no one data source that accurately quantifies the number of child victims in the UK. The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) currently provides the best measure of potential victims, although is known to be an undercount. Data for the UK NRM for the year ending December 2021 shows:
an increase of 9% in the number of potential child victims referred compared with the previous year (from 5,028 to 5,468)
of those referred, more than 9 in 10 (91%) received a positive reasonable grounds decision (RGD), meaning they were assessed as reasonably likely to be victims
almost four-fifths (79%) of positive RGDs were for boys; this proportion has increased rapidly since the year ending March 2015
boys who received a positive RGD were most likely to have been criminally exploited (62%) while girls were most likely to have been sexually exploited (42%)
over four-fifths (82%) of children who received a positive RGD were aged 15 to 17 years

24,"Most deprived areas of England and Wales saw higher avoidable mortality rates in 2020 
Avoidable mortality rates on account of coronavirus (COVID-19) were higher in the most deprived areas of England and Wales, compared with the least deprived areas. 
Avoidable deaths are those considered preventable or treatable for those aged under 75 years, and COVID-19 has been assigned as a preventable cause of death. 
The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) for COVID-19 in the most deprived areas of England was 95.1 deaths per 100,000 males, and 53.3 deaths per 100,000 females. This was more than four times higher for men, and more than five times higher for women than in the least deprived areas. 
In the least deprived areas, the ASMR was 21.9 deaths per 100,000 males, and 9.4 deaths per 100,000 females.

30,"Most deprived areas of England and Wales saw higher avoidable mortality rates in 2020 
Avoidable mortality rates on account of coronavirus (COVID-19) were higher in the most deprived areas of England and Wales, compared with the least deprived areas. 
Avoidable deaths are those considered preventable or treatable for those aged under 75 years, and COVID-19 has been assigned as a preventable cause of death. 
The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) for COVID-19 in the most deprived areas of England was 95.1 deaths per 100,000 males, and 53.3 deaths per 100,000 females. This was more than four times higher for men, and more than five times higher for women than in the least deprived areas. 
In the least deprived areas, the ASMR was 21.9 deaths per 100,000 males, and 9.4 deaths per 100,000 females. 
Overall, avoidable mortality rates increased in England in 2020, compared with 2019, reversing a long-term decline in avoidable mortality rates.

36,"Disabled people are more likely to feel life will never return to normal
Around one in six disabled people (16%) feel that their life will never return to normal after the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, according to Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) data from 16 to 27 February 2022. 
Almost 1 in 10 non-disabled adults (11%) felt their life was already back to normal, compared with 6% among disabled people. 
During the survey response period, most restrictions on daily life to curb the spread of coronavirus had been lifted in Great Britain. 
Disabled people were more likely than non-disabled people to avoid crowded places, avoid close contact with those they do not live with, and spend more time at home because of coronavirus. 

Question: “Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which of these do you currently do?”
The response option ""work from home"" was asked of all adults, not just those in employment.

Young adults aged 16 to 24 years were the least likely to report avoiding crowded places because of coronavirus (33%) and were more than four times as likely as those aged 70 years and older to report not doing any of the listed behaviours (9% of adults aged 16 to 24 years compared with 2% of those aged 70 years and over).
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronaviruscovid19disabledpeoplearemorelikelytofeellifewillneverreturntonormal/2022-03-16,"With most restrictions lifted, over half of people in Great Britain were avoiding crowded places and spending more time at home in February 2022 
16 March 2022
In February 2022, almost a third of people in Great Britain (32%) felt it would take more than a year for life to return to normal following the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This is almost three times higher than at the start of the pandemic (11% between 27 March and 6 April 2020). According to Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) data from between 16 and 27 February 2022, more than 1 in 10 people (12%) thought life would never return to normal, and 9% felt their life had already returned to normal. 
Disabled people were more likely than non-disabled people to feel life would never return to normal, while non-disabled people were more likely to feel life was already back to normal. People who could afford an unexpected £850 expense were more likely than those who couldn’t to feel that life had already returned to normal. 
Although almost all restrictions had been lifted by late February 2022, most adults reported taking at least one preventative measure to stop the spread of COVID-19. Around four-fifths of people reported frequently washing or sanitising hands (81%), 76% wore face coverings and 57% avoided crowded places. 
Updates on the percentage of people maintaining certain preventative measures to slow the spread of coronavirus are published in our fortnightly release on Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain. See the Measuring the data section for details on the differences between data presented in this article and in the fortnightly release. 
The proportion of people who feel that life is already back to normal since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has risen from 4% of adults surveyed in late December 2021 and early January 2022, to 9% between 16 and 27 February 2022. 
All other attitudes about how long it would take for life to return to normal have remained fairly stable during 2022. However the proportion of people who think it will take a year or less for life to return to normal fell considerably throughout 2021.

People’s expectations of when life will return to normal differed by a range of characteristics. In February 2022, disabled people were almost two times less likely to think that their life had returned to normal (6%) than non-disabled people (11%). Disabled people were also more likely to think that life would never return to normal (16% of disabled people compared with 10% of non-disabled). 
People who were unable to afford an unexpected but necessary £850 expense, and therefore may be struggling financially, were three times less likely to feel that life was back to normal (4%) than people who could afford it (12%). People unable to afford an expense were also more likely to feel it would take more than a year before life returned to normal (39% compared with 29%). 
Parents with dependent children were more likely to feel it would be more than a year before their life returned to normal (39% compared with 29% of non-parents). 
Respondents to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) were asked about their behaviours because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This question was asked at the end of February 2022, when the majority of restrictions and guidance in place in Great Britain to manage the spread of COVID-19 had been lifted. During the response period, self-isolation requirements in England were also removed. 
The behaviours most commonly reported were frequent hand washing (81%) and wearing face coverings (76%). More than half of people reported that they were avoiding crowded places (57%) and spending more time at home (53%). 
Previous analysis found similar behavioural trends in Summer 2021, following the lifting of most coronavirus restrictions in England from 19 July 2021. Three-quarters (75%) of adults in Great Britain said they still planned to sanitise their hands regularly, two-thirds (64%) planned to cover their faces in shops and 60% planned to avoid crowded places. 
Regardless of restrictions, 45% of people reported avoiding close contact with people they do not live with in February 2022. The same percentage (45%) reported opening windows and doors in enclosed spaces. 
Around a sixth of adults (16%) reported that they were no longer going into school or work when experiencing cold or flu symptoms. This rose to 23% among parents of dependent children and fell to 14% among non-parents. 
Around a quarter of people (26%) said they were avoiding public transport. This reflects trends seen elsewhere, with data from the Department for Transport (DfT) showing public transport use is yet to return to pre-coronavirus levels. 
Use of private forms of transport is recovering faster than public, according to DfT. Over the week commencing 14 February 2022, cycling was at 97% of pre-coronavirus levels in England. On 17 February 2022, use of cars was at 91% of pre-coronavirus levels in Great Britain, while use of national rail was at 73%. Buses outside of London were at 72% of pre-coronavirus levels. In London, use of the tube was at 64% of pre-coronavirus levels, and use of London buses was at 80% of pre-coronavirus levels. 
Around a third of the OPN respondents (35%) reported they were doing more shopping online because of COVID-19. Online sales remained higher than pre-coronavirus levels, according to Retail Sales Index data. 
In January 2022, online sales made up a quarter (25%) of all retail sales. This was the lowest proportion since March 2020, but still 5 percentage points higher than before the pandemic.
In February 2022, disabled people were more likely than non-disabled people to feel that life will never return to normal (16% compared with 10%). This trend has been consistent throughout the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Disabled people were also less likely than non-disabled people to think life had already returned to normal (6% compared with 11%). 
Previous analysis of the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on disabled people has shown that between March 2020 and December 2021 disabled people were more likely to report feeling very uncomfortable or uncomfortable about leaving their homes. Disabled people also reported a greater impact on their wellbeing, as well as access to healthcare and treatment for non-coronavirus-related issues. 
These effects on daily life were reflected in the behaviours disabled people adopted because of the pandemic. In February 2022, the majority of disabled people (67%) reported they were avoiding crowded places, compared with 54% of non-disabled people. 
Disabled people were also more likely than non-disabled people to avoid close contact with those they do not live with (57% of disabled people compared with 41% of non-disabled) and spend more time at home because of coronavirus (63% of disabled people compared with 49% of non-disabled). 
Disabled people were less likely to have spent more time outdoors because of the pandemic (8% of disabled people compared with 16% of non-disabled people). However, they used digital technology more for socialising, hobbies, and activities than non-disabled people (31% compared with 21%).

A third of adults aged 16 to 24 years (33%) reported avoiding crowded places, compared with half of those aged 25 to 34 years (50%) and 71% of those aged 70 years and over.
Less than two-thirds of people aged 16 to 24 years (61%) wore face coverings, compared with 85% of those aged 70 years and over. The proportion of people frequently using hand gel or hand washing fell to 69% among those aged 16 to 24 years and rose to 89% among those aged 70 years and over. 
Almost a tenth (9%) of those aged 16 to 24 years were not doing any of the behaviours listed, compared with 2% of those aged 70 years and over. 
Younger age groups (those aged 16 to 24 and 25 to 34 years) were less likely than older age groups to avoid close contact with those they do not live with. Around a fifth (19%) of adults aged 16 to 24 years avoided close contact with people they do not live with compared with 61% of those aged 70 years and over. 
Almost one in six (15%) of those aged 16 to 24 years think their life has already returned to normal; this was significantly higher than those aged 25 to 34 years (5%) and those aged 70 years and over (6%). 
In late February, women were more likely than men to frequently use hand gel or wash hands, open windows or doors in indoor spaces, avoid crowded places, and wear face coverings and avoid public transport because of coronavirus. 
Men were more likely than women to report not doing any behaviours because of coronavirus (6% of men compared with 2% of women). 
Download the data for adults adopting behaviours because of the coronavirus, by sex (XLSX, 10KB)
Women were also more likely than men to report shopping online more (39% of women compared with 31% of men) and spending more time at home (58% of women compared with 48% of men). 
While women were more likely than men to adopt behaviours because of coronavirus, men and women’s attitudes towards the return to normal were similar. Women were equally as likely as men to feel that their life has already returned to normal (9%), and there was no significant difference in the proportion of men and women feeling that life would never return to normal or return to normal in over a year. However, women were more likely than men to be unsure when life would return to normal (31% of women and 24% of men). 
Overall, 14% of people said they were spending more time outside because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This fell to 10% among those unable to afford an unexpected but necessary expense of £850 and rose to 16% among those who could afford one. 
People unable to afford an unexpected expense were also less likely to report walking or cycling more (11% of those unable to afford an expense compared with 18% of those who were able to afford one), and working from home (13% compared with 23%). 
Previous analysis of Time Use Survey data from March and April 2020 showed the amount of time people in higher income households they spent on fitness during lockdown increased, while people in low-income households saw no change. 
Those on lower incomes were also more likely to have continued working outside the home compared with patterns before the coronavirus pandemic.

37,"Distrust and perceived risks top reasons for vaccine refusal
“Side effects of the vaccine frightened me” 
“I cannot do anything that may risk my fertility” 
“If my body can fight it without a vaccine that’s good enough for me” 
These are just some of the free-text responses collected as part of the Vaccine Opinions Study which provide insight into why some people remain unvaccinated. 
Reasons for not vaccinating have been grouped into seven broad themes; 
 - feeling that the risks of a COVID-19 vaccine were too high or the benefits were too low
 - distrusting or feeling discontent towards vaccine stakeholders
 - lacking sufficient, trustworthy or favourable evidence on vaccine side effects, safety or effectiveness
 - perceiving COVID-19 as low-risk to self
 - feeling pressured or coerced
 - worldview-related barriers
 - practical barriers
The Vaccine Opinions Study identified changes in uptake and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines among adults in England who had reported having declined a vaccine when offered, being unlikely to have it or unsure about having it if offered, between 13 January and 8 August 2021. In this period, we saw a decline in this population from 10% to 3%. 
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/articles/coronavirusandchangingperceptionstowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021,"Respondents from the COVID-19 Vaccine Opinions Study were able to write additional reasons, beyond those presented in multiple-selection lists, that had encouraged them, stopped them or would encourage them to get a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.
Primary motivations among adults who decided to get vaccinated included ""protecting others or oneself"", ""regaining freedoms and rights"" and ""being influenced by others"".
The main reasons for those who remained unvaccinated included ""feeling that the risks of a COVID-19 vaccine were too high or the benefits were too low"", ""distrusting or feeling discontent towards vaccine stakeholders"" such as the government and vaccine manufacturers, and ""lacking sufficient, trustworthy or favourable evidence on vaccine side effects, safety or effectiveness"".
Unvaccinated adults reported ""having sufficient or trustworthy evidence on vaccine side effects, safety or effectiveness"" and ""feeling that the risks of a COVID-19 vaccine were lower or the benefits were higher"" as the main factors that would encourage them to have a vaccine in the future.
Responses often included more than one theme, particularly those reporting barriers to vaccination, which suggests that the decision of whether to have a COVID-19 vaccine is complex.
Some interventions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as lockdowns and vaccine passports, encouraged some respondents to vaccinate but were a barrier to others.
For some respondents, the barriers to vaccination were practical ones, such as having a disability or difficulty accessing a vaccination site.
"
38,"COVID-19 mortality rates lowest for those with three vaccinations
The risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) in England has been consistently lower for people who had a third vaccine dose or booster at least 21 days ago, compared with those who are unvaccinated. 
This has been the case for all age groups across all months since boosters were introduced in September 2021. 
People who had received a second vaccine dose over six months ago had a higher risk of death involving COVID-19 than those who had received a second dose less than six months ago, indicating possible waning protection from vaccination over time. 
While these statistics are adjusted for age, they cannot be used to determine vaccine effectiveness. This is because vaccinated and unvaccinated people are likely to differ in characteristics other than age, such as underlying health. Some deaths are expected in vaccinated individuals as the number of people who are vaccinated is high and no vaccine is 100% effective.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1january2021and31january2022,"Monthly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) have been consistently lower for all months since booster introduction in September 2021 for people who had received a third dose or booster at least 21 days ago, compared with unvaccinated people and those with a first or second dose.
Monthly ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 broken down by age group have been consistently lower for all months and all ages for those who had received a third dose or booster at least 21 days ago, compared with unvaccinated people.
Monthly ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 have been consistently lower for people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people, until November 2021, but increased through November 2021 to January 2022, particularly in older age groups; this may be driven by a change in the composition of the group with most people in older age groups having received a third dose or booster, or waning protection from prior vaccination.
Those who had received a second dose over six months ago had higher monthly ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 than those who had received a second dose less than six months ago, indicating possible waning protection from vaccination over time.
The age-adjusted rates are not equivalent to measures of vaccine effectiveness; they account for differences in age structure and population size but there may be other differences between the groups, particularly underlying health, which affect the mortality rates.
Changes in non-COVID-19 mortality by vaccination status are largely driven by the changing composition of the vaccination status groups; this is because of the prioritisation of clinically extremely vulnerable and people with underlying health conditions, and differences in timing of vaccination among people who were eligible.

The number of deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 4 March 2022 was 12,741. This was 51 deaths above the five-year average of the deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 4 March 2022. Of the 12,741 deaths registered, 814 involved COVID-19, which was 65 fewer than in the previous week. 
From the week ending 13 March 2020 to the week ending 4 March 2022, the number of excess deaths above the five-year average in England and Wales was 120,748. The total number recorded in England was 115,984, while the total number recorded in Wales was 6,100.

"
40,"Most vaccinated coronavirus (COVID-19) contacts take daily tests
The majority (67%) of vaccinated close contacts of a coronavirus (COVID-19) case reported undertaking daily testing and completing all required daily lateral flow tests (LFTs) between 21 and 26 February 2022. Legal restrictions for contacts of a positive COVID-19 case were lifted on 24 February 2022. 
The proportion of people who often or always reported their LFT results increased from 34% of people aged 18 to 29 years to 59% of those aged 70 years and over. 
Among the 24% of people who did not take daily LFTs following close contact, the most common reasons given were respondents not thinking taking tests were useful (33%) and not having access to enough tests (15%). 
Around one-fifth of respondents (18%) felt the current isolation guidance for those who are double vaccinated was insufficient to keep the public safe. Around three-fifths (61%) reported taking additional measures to keep themselves and others safe, beyond government guidelines.

Two-thirds (67%) of respondents undertook daily testing and completed all the required tests, but this was a significantly lower proportion than early February 2022 (75%).
Of those who undertook daily testing, a significantly lower proportion of respondents experienced difficulties obtaining tests in late February 2022 (12%), compared with early February (19%) and early January 2022 (46%).
Almost two-fifths (37%) of respondents who took part in daily testing never reported their results, while just under half (45%) said they often or always reported their results.
Around one-quarter of respondents (23%) correctly identified that someone does not need to have received the booster dose to be considered fully vaccinated.

41,"Rise in economic inactivity among over 50s driven by retirements
Economic inactivity among those aged 50 years and over has increased since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, following a historical downward trend over the previous 10 years. 
The new Over 50s Lifestyle Study (OLS) asks those who left work during the pandemic about why they left and whether they intend to return. 
Of those who had not returned to work, retirement was by far the most common reason for leaving paid work among people aged 50 to 70 years (47%), followed by the coronavirus pandemic (15%). 
Compared with those who left work before the pandemic, those who left during the pandemic were more likely to:  have left work sooner than they were expecting (63% compared with 54%) have left work not by choice (25% compared with 20%) consider returning to work (39% compared with 19%) 
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/articles/impactofcoronavirusonpeopleaged50to70yearsandtheiremploymentafterthepandemic/2022-03-14,"The findings from this qualitative study showed that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has somewhat affected participants' decision to leave the labour market.
There were participants who retired sooner than they were intending to as they had been made redundant during the pandemic.
Others were put on furlough, and because of this, left their job as a paid employee to become self-employed.
Participants who became self-employed during the pandemic did not intend to return to their previous job, as they preferred the work and flexibility.
Overall, those in our sample generally moved or stayed out of the job market after the pandemic because of complex and interrelated factors, including being unable to find a job, their age, ill health, caring for others, concerns about catching COVID-19, and financial security (for example, from a pension or a spouse's salary).
Others returned to part-time work as they needed to top-up their pension and pay for unforeseen costs (for example, needing to relocate because of caring responsibilities).
There were female participants who reported being affected by the increase in retirement age from 60 to 66 years; they either lost several years of their pension or had to delay retirement.
Although there were participants whose mental and physical health had been negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic, changes to their health was not cited as a reason for them staying out of work.
"
42,"Infections have risen across the UK
The percentage of people estimated to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) rose in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the week ending 5 March 2022 (6 March 2022 for Scotland).
The estimated number of people living in private households (not in hospitals, care homes or other communal establishments) who had COVID-19 in the most recent week was:
 - 2,073,900 people (1 in 25) in England
 - 97,900 people (1 in 30) in Wales
 - 143,800 people (1 in 13) in Northern Ireland

44,"9 in 10 travellers arriving to the UK are double vaccinated
Most UK and overseas residents arriving in the UK in January 2022 have received at least two coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations, at 98% and 96%, respectively. 
According to the International Passenger Survey (IPS), the proportion of UK residents arriving in the UK who have received more than two COVID-19 vaccinations doubled between December and January, increasing from 28% to 56%. 
Of travellers arriving in the UK, most continue to think that having a COVID-19 test prior to arrival is either “very important” or “quite important” for safety; 81% of UK residents and 87% of overseas residents in January 2022 agreed with these statements. 
The increase in the percentage of UK residents who had received more than two vaccinations reflects the expansion of the National Health Service (NHS) booster programme to all adults over 18 years of age, with those eligible to have been offered a vaccination by the end of January 2022.

50,"Almost half those with long COVID have had it for at least a year
An estimated 1.5 million people (or 2.4%) living in private households said they were living with long COVID, as of the end of January 2022.
Of those who said they had long COVID, 685,000 people (or 45%) were experiencing symptoms at least a year after the initial infection.
The estimates in this analysis refer to self-reported long COVID – symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after the first suspected coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that were not explained by something else.
Almost two-thirds (65%) of those with self-reported long COVID said that it affected their day-to-day activities, equivalent to 989,000 people. Of those, 281,000 said that they were “limited a lot”.
Fatigue continued to be the most reported symptom, affecting 51% of those with self-reported long COVID.
As a proportion of the UK population, prevalence of self-reported long COVID was greatest in people aged 35 to 49 years, females, people living in more deprived areas, those working in teaching and education, social care or healthcare, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability.

The estimates presented in this analysis relate to self-reported long COVID, as experienced by study participants who responded to a representative survey, rather than clinically diagnosed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 syndrome in the full population.
Of people with self-reported long COVID, 344,000 (22%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 less than 12 weeks previously, 1.1 million (71%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously, and 685,000 (45%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least one year previously.
Long-COVID symptoms adversely affected the day-to-day activities of 989,000 people (65% of those with self-reported long COVID), with 281,000 (18%) reporting that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been ""limited a lot"".
Fatigue continued to be the most common symptom reported as part of individuals' experience of long COVID (51% of those with self-reported long COVID), followed by shortness of breath (35%), loss of smell (34%), and loss of taste and difficulty concentrating (both 25%).
As a proportion of the UK population, prevalence of self-reported long COVID was greatest in people aged 35 to 49 years, females, people living in more deprived areas, those working in teaching and education, social care or health care (likely reflecting increased exposure to COVID-19 infection in these sectors), and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability.

People previously infected with coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to be less likely to test positive than those who have not experienced a prior infection, according to data collected in the fortnight up to 12 February 2022.
Those who reported working in the education sector continued to be more likely to test positive in comparison with other working adults. This is likely because of the recent high rate of infe ctions among school children.
People who had travelled abroad in the last 28 days also continued to be more likely to test positive than those who had not. People who live in multiple occupancy households continued to be more likely to test positive than people living alone.

The data collected between 7 and 12 February 2022 show that the majority (80%) of respondents who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) fully adhered to self-isolation requirements; this is in line with the levels reported for January 2022 (79%).
Adherence to self-isolation requirements was statistically significantly lower between the onset of symptoms requiring self-isolation and receiving a positive test result (73%), compared with the 24 hours following a positive result (98%) and the remainder of the self-isolation period (91%).
Approximately 9 in 10 (92%) respondents reported that they had no difficulties in accessing COVID-19 tests; this is statistically significantly higher than in January 2022 (74%).

On 17 January 2022, the self-isolation advice for people in England who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) changed. Those who tested positive could end self-isolation after five full days, following two negative lateral flow tests (LFTs) taken 24 hours apart on days five and six of their self-isolation. Respondents in this survey will have been subject to these rules.
More information on identifying this group of people and collecting the data can be found in the Glossary and Measuring the data sections.
Two-thirds of respondents (67%) fully understood self-isolation guidance regarding permitted reasons to leave the home. Adherence among those who fully understood the guidance (84%) was statistically significantly higher compared with those who misunderstood or were unsure on self-isolation guidance (72%).
Most respondents (97%) reported that they were fully aware of the new isolation guidance. Of those who were aware, 88% took an LFT on days five and six of their isolation; of these, 73% tested positive in at least one LFT. 
Since 11 January 2022, people living in England who tested positive for COVID-19 with an LFT were no longer required to confirm they were positive with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Exceptions to this rule included those who wished to apply for a payment through the NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme. Other exceptions are on the gov.uk website.
Almost 9 in 10 (86%) respondents were aware of this policy change; however, of these, 34% still reported taking a PCR test. Of those who were aware of the policy change and took a PCR test, 90% did not apply for payment through the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme.
Government guidance advises that to be classified as fully vaccinated, you need to have two doses of a recognised vaccine. Almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents thought that they needed a booster to be fully vaccinated.
On 24 February 2022, the self-isolation advice for people in England who tested positive for COVID-19 changed. The legal requirement to self-isolate following a positive test was removed. Until 1 April 2022, adults and children who test positive continue to be advised to stay home and avoid contact with other people for at least five full days, and to follow the guidance until they have received two negative tests results on consecutive days. Respondents in this survey were not subject to these new rules.
Around 7 in 10 (72%) respondents reported that they would continue to self-isolate if they became infected with COVID-19, even if it were no longer a legal requirement. This was statistically significantly higher among respondents who agreed that COVID-19 poses a risk to either themselves personally, one or more of their friends and family, or society (73%), compared with those who disagree (34%). This percentage is based on sample counts of less than 30 and should be treated with caution.
From 1 April 2022, the government will no longer provide free universal symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public in England.
When respondents were asked whether they would take a COVID-19 test if they had to buy one, 63% agreed that they would. There was no significant difference between those in the most deprived areas (59%) who agreed that they would pay for a test, and those in the least deprived areas (64%) who agreed that they would pay for a test.
Approximately one-third (35%) of those who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their well-being and mental health. The average (mean) life satisfaction for those who tested positive (all respondents) was 7.9 out of 10.0. Most respondents (96%) reported that they did not experience difficulties preventing them from self-isolating or getting a test.
From 24 February 2022, workers were no longer legally obliged to tell their employers that they are required to self-isolate. From 24 March 2022, coronavirus provisions within the Statutory Sick Pay and Employment and Support Allowance regulations will end; however, people with COVID-19 may still be eligible, subject to the normal conditions of entitlement. As this survey is based on those who began isolation on 1 and 4 February 2022, this policy change does not affect respondents in this survey.
Of respondents who were in full-time, part-time, or unpaid employment, or receiving sick pay or unpaid leave from work, most (98%) reported their employer was aware that they had to self-isolate. Of those testing positive for COVID-19 who were not retired, 24% reported they lost income because of isolation, and 16% reported that self-isolating meant they were likely to lose their job or miss out on work. Those who were not double-vaccinated were statistically significantly more likely to have lost income because of self-isolation (46%), compared with those with two or more coronavirus vaccine doses (23%). The previous percentage is based on sample counts of less than 30 and should be treated with caution.
Most respondents (94%) did not apply for a payment through the NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme. Of respondents who did not apply, 66% said they were aware of the scheme but not eligible for it, and a further 20% reported they were not aware of the scheme.

Self-isolation refers to not leaving your home because you have, or might have, coronavirus (COVID-19). It is a legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive for COVID-19. In addition to staying at home, if you are self-isolating, you should not have visitors unless the purpose of the visit is to provide essential care. At the time of data collection, your self-isolation period includes the day your symptoms started (or the day you had the positive test result if you do not have symptoms) and the next 5 to 10 full days. If you still have symptoms after 10 days, you must continue self-isolating until they are gone.
More information can be found in the NHS guidance on when and how to self-isolate.
On 22 December 2021, the self-isolation advice for people in England who tested positive for COVID-19 changed. Those who tested positive could end self-isolation after seven days, following two negative lateral flow tests (LFTs) taken 24 hours apart on days six and seven of their self-isolation.
As of 17 January 2022, the self-isolation period was reduced to five days, on the condition that the individual has two negative LFTs taken on days five and six and does not have a high temperature.
On 24 February 2022, the self-isolation advice for people in England who tested positive for COVID-19 changed. The legal requirement to self-isolate following a positive test was removed. Until 1 April 2022, adults and children who test positive continue to be advised to stay home and avoid contact with other people for at least five full days, and to follow the guidance until they have received two negative test results on consecutive days. Respondents in this survey were not subject to these rules.
More information can be found in Self-isolation for COVID-19 cases reduced from 10 days to 7 days following negative Lateral Flow Device (LFD) tests and Self-isolation for those with COVID-19 can end after 5 full days following 2 negative LFD tests.
Symptoms that require an individual to self-isolate prior to a positive test result are a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste.
Symptoms reported by respondents that do not require self-isolation if experienced without a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste are:
The term ""significant"" refers to statistically significant changes or differences. Significance has been determined using the 95% confidence intervals, where instances of non-overlapping confidence intervals between estimates indicate the difference is unlikely to have arisen from random fluctuation. More information is available on our uncertainty pages.
The latest quality and methodology information on data from the COVID Test and Trace Cases Insights Survey can be found in the Coronavirus and self-isolation after testing positive in England methodology.
This is the 11th bulletin in this series. The 11th wave of data was collected between 7 and 12 February 2022. The number of respondents was 1,006.
Respondents were sampled through the Contact Tracing and Advisory Service (CTAS) database, held by NHS Test and Trace, using implicit stratification. Respondents were aged 18 years and over, had tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) and reached day six of their self-isolation period between 7 and 12 February 2022.
The majority (96%) of respondents were interviewed between six and nine days after starting their self-isolation. The remaining 4% of respondents were interviewed between 10 and 11 days after starting their self-isolation.
Of the potential respondents who were successfully contacted by an interviewer, the response rate was 64%. When including cases where contact was attempted but not made, the response rate was 18%.
A low response rate can be expected, because the target population may have been unwell with COVID-19, and therefore less likely to participate.
Percentages in this report are based on weighted counts that are representative of the population of adults (aged 18 years and over) who had tested positive for COVID-19 and began their self-isolation period between 10 January to 6 February 2022.
The statistics presented are Experimental Statistics, so care needs to be taken when interpreting them. The survey has a relatively small number of respondents (1,006) and the behaviour of respondents during self-isolation is self-reported.
Information on the strengths and limitations of this survey are available in the Coronavirus and self-isolation after testing positive in England methodology.

Since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, of the 274,063 deaths to care home residents in England and Wales, 45,632 (16.7%) involved COVID-19. 
There were more total deaths of care home residents compared to the five-year average in the first wave of the pandemic with 26,035 excess deaths in England and 1,046 excess deaths in Wales. In the second and third waves, however, total deaths fell below the five-year average.
In England, total deaths of care home residents increased by 16.5% between the first and second waves with 85,305 and 99,380 deaths respectively. Following this, deaths decreased by 23.9% between the second and third waves (75,664) deaths.

55,"Long COVID and mental disorders in school students
Of primary school pupils with long COVID, 30.0% had a probable mental disorder, a significantly higher proportion than the 7.7% of those without long COVID. Among secondary school pupils, 22.6% of those who had experienced long COVID had a probable mental disorder, compared with 13.6% of those who hadn’t experienced long COVID.
Since March 2020, 1.0% of primary school-aged pupils and 2.7% of secondary school-aged pupils experienced long COVID.
Among students who had previously received a positive coronavirus (COVID-19) test, 5.2% experienced an ongoing symptom of loss of taste or smell, compared with 0.4% of those who hadn’t tested positive. This is the only symptom that was significantly more prevalent among students with a previous coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that 82% of secondary school pupils and 40% of primary school pupils tested positive for coronavirus antibodies between November and December 2021. About a third of pupils aged four to seven years (33.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. 
Secondary school pupils over the age of 12 years were eligible to have a vaccine at the time of testing so may have had antibodies from either natural infection or vaccination.

""Loss of taste or smell"" was the only symptom group where the prevalence was significantly higher for those who had received a positive coronavirus (COVID-19) test since March 2020 than those who hadn't, for both primary and secondary school-aged pupils aged under 16 years.
Both primary and secondary school pupils who tested positive for COVID-19 showed no significant difference in the number presenting with a ""probable mental disorder"" compared with those without a positive test.
Primary school pupils with long COVID (under the Delphi criteria) were significantly more likely to have a probable mental disorder (30.0%) than those without long COVID (7.7%); the trend was similar for secondary school pupils (22.6% compared with 13.6%), but this is not statistically significant.

56,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections decrease in most age groups
The percentage of people estimated to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased in most age groups in the week ending 19 February 2022. Infections fell among those aged 2 years to school Year 6, school Year 7 to 11, school Year 12 to age 24 years and aged 35 to 49 years. 
Trends were uncertain among those aged 25 to 34 years, aged 50 to 69 years and those aged 70 years and over. 
The highest infection level remained among those aged 2 years to school Year 6 at 4.84%, down from 7.60% the previous week. The percentage of people estimated to test positive for COVID-19 was lowest among those aged 70 years and over at 2.08%. 
The estimated number of people living in private households (not in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments) that had COVID-19 in the most recent week was:

57,"Risk of death involving COVID-19 lower following Omicron infection
The risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) is 67% lower following an Omicron variant infection compared with the Delta variant. 
This is an estimate based on data from COVID-19 infections in England in December 2021, adjusting for differences including vaccination status, age, sex, and previous infections. 
The difference in risk of death involving COVID-19 between Omicron and Delta varied by age and sex. There was a greater reduction in the risk of death following an Omicron infection relative to Delta for people aged under 70 years compared with those aged 70 years and over. 
The reduction in risk of death involving COVID-19 was more pronounced among males than among females.

59,"Increase in lateral flow testing among vaccinated coronavirus contacts
Most fully-vaccinated contacts of a positive coronavirus (COVID-19) case in England (80%) reported that they had undertaken daily rapid lateral flow testing. This figure, from data collected between 31 January and 5 February 2022, is significantly higher than the 70% from the period 10 to 15 January 2022.
Of those who undertook daily testing, a significantly lower proportion of respondents experienced difficulties obtaining tests in February 2022 (19%), compared with early January 2022 (46%).
Around two-fifths (40%) of respondents who took part in daily testing did not report their results, while around a third (33%) said they always reported their results.
Around one-fifth of respondents (18%) correctly identified that someone does not need to have received the booster dose to be considered fully vaccinated.

Vaccination rates were lowest in those aged 18 to 34 years, with 80% reporting having received a third vaccination. People in this age group were less likely to have received a third vaccination if they: 
were male 
lived in larger households 
lived in more deprived areas 
identified as being from a non-white ethnic minority group 
Results from those aged 35 to 64 years and those aged 65 years and over are available in our article on the characteristics associated with third vaccination uptake

Vaccination rates varied by occupation groups. Health professionals (84.7%) and teaching and other educational professionals (83.6%) were most likely to have received three vaccinations. These groups also had the lowest proportions of people who had not received a vaccine (3.1% and 4.2%, respectively). 
Those working in elementary trades and related occupations (57.6%) and skilled construction and building trades (61.8%) were the least likely to have received three vaccinations. These groups also had the highest proportions of people who had not received a vaccination (15.1% and 12.7%, respectively). 
Differences in vaccination status between occupations were not driven by geographical, socio-demographic and health differences, as the ranking remained largely unchanged after adjusting for these factors.

People previously infected with COVID-19 continued to be less likely to test positive than those who have not experienced a prior infection, according to data collected in the two weeks up to 12 March 2022. 
People who reported being unvaccinated were more likely to test positive than people who reported receiving: 
a third COVID-19 vaccination 15 to 90 days ago 
a second Pfizer vaccine 15 to 90 days ago or more than 180 days ago 
a second AstraZeneca or Moderna vaccine more than 180 days ago 
one vaccine 15 to 180 days ago 
any vaccine up to 14 days ago

Compared with unvaccinated pupils, those aged 12 to 15 years who had received one vaccine dose more than 14 days ago: 
were 38% less likely to report a positive test in the first half of the Autumn 2021 term (20 September to 3 November 2021)
were 23% less likely to report a positive test in the second half of the Autumn 2021 term (4 November to 17 December 2021) 
The lower estimates in the second half of the Autumn term may reflect waning protection and reduced vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant, which became more common towards the end of the term. 
This analysis controlled for differences in the characteristics between vaccinated and unvaccinated pupils.

Schools with higher proportions of pupils eligible for free school meals (FSM) had lower vaccination rates (up to 9 January 2022). Schools with more than half of their pupils accessing FSM had a median vaccination rate of 29.2%, compared with schools where less than 5% of pupils accessed FSM which had a median vaccination rate of 73.2%. 
Free school meals (FSM) are a statutory benefit available to school aged children from families who meet the qualifying criteria (predominantly based around income), which is published by the Department for Education. Here, we have defined FSM as pupils having been eligible for FSM in the last six years, using information recorded by schools as part of the English Schools Census. As a result, the proportion of FSM-eligible pupils in a school can be considered a measure for the level of deprivation in that school.

The majority (76%) of fully-vaccinated contacts of a positive COVID-19 case reported undertaking daily lateral flow testing, with around three-quarters (67%) undertaking daily testing and completing all required tests (21 February to 26 February 2022).
Of those who undertook lateral flow testing, 19% reported testing positive for COVID-19 on one of their tests.  
Around three-fifths (61%) of fully-vaccinated contacts reported taking additional measures to keep themselves and others safe, beyond government guidelines. 
Since 14 December 2021, fully vaccinated contacts of a positive COVID-19 case were advised to take a lateral flow test every day for seven days. The advice for fully vaccinated contacts to start daily testing was removed on 24 February 2022 in England. All respondents were surveyed at a time nearing the end of a period where they were advised to do daily testing. In this context, an individual is considered fully vaccinated if they have received the recommended doses of the vaccine, regardless of whether they have had the booster dose.

60,"Antibody levels remain high
New data show the percentage of the population estimated to have tested positive for antibodies against the specific virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19). 
The figures show a higher standard threshold, which reflects people who have had the virus or been vaccinated against it.
In the adult population, the following are estimated to have antibodies at the 179 nanograms per millilitre (ng/ml) threshold against SARS-CoV-2, in the week beginning 31 January 2022:
 - in England: 98.2%
 - in Wales: 97.9%
 - in Northern Ireland: 98.2%

The risk of reinfection was around 10 times higher in the period when the Omicron variant was most common (20 December 2021 to 20 March 2022), compared with the period when the Delta variant was most common (17 May to 19 December 2021).  
Between 2 July 2020 and 20 March 2022, people were more likely to be reinfected if they: 
were unvaccinated 
had a ""milder"" primary infection with a lower viral load 
were younger 
lived in more deprived areas 
The way we define reinfections has changed. For more information, see the updated definition in the latest bulletin.

Age-standardised COVID-19 case rates in the second wave of the pandemic (1 September 2020 to 22 May 2021) were higher for non-UK residents, but were higher for those born in the UK since the start of the third wave (23 May 2021). 
In the second wave of the pandemic, case rates were higher in households from lower socio-economic groups than more affluent ones. However, in the third wave there was little difference between socio-economic groups other than those who had never worked or were long-term unemployed, where case rates were the lowest .

In the UK, the most commonly reported symptoms have consistently been cough, fatigue and headache. The least commonly reported symptoms have consistently been abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and nausea or vomiting. 
In March 2022, 66% of people testing positive reported any specific symptoms. The percentage of people reporting loss of taste or loss of smell remains at a low level in March 2022, after decreasing sharply between December 2021 and January 2022. This change coincides with increasing infections with the Omicron variants of COVID-19. 
The percentage of people reporting a sore throat, cough or fatigue increased from January to March 2022. However, these symptoms also relate to many other infections in circulation at this time.

An estimated 1.7 million people in private households (2.7% of the population) were experiencing self-reported long COVID as of 5 March 2022. Of those, over two-thirds (69%) reported experiencing long COVID symptoms at least 12 weeks after first having coronavirus (COVID-19), and almost half (45%) at least one year after the first (suspected) infection.  
Fatigue (51%), shortness of breath (34%), loss of smell (28%) and muscle ache (24%) were the most common long COVID symptoms. Symptoms adversely affected the day-to-day activities of around two-thirds (67%) of those with self-reported long COVID.    
Self-reported long COVID was more common in those aged 35 to 49 years, females, people living in more deprived areas, those working in social care, teaching and education, or health care, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability.

Around 1 in 100 (1.0%) primary school pupils met all the criteria for long COVID at some point since March 2020. One in five (20.0%) primary pupils had a positive COVID-19 test of any kind since March 2020. 
Nearly half (47.5%) of primary school pupils with a positive test since March 2020 were reported to have experienced at least one recurring symptom. This was 46.6% for those without a positive test. Around a quarter (26.0%) of primary school pupils with a positive test experienced three or more symptoms, compared with 20.7% of those without a positive test. 
Of the symptoms which children had displayed for 12 weeks or more, “loss of taste or smell” was the only symptom group that was significantly more commonly reported in those with a positive test (5.2%) than in those without (0.4%).

Two vaccine doses received at least two weeks before COVID-19 infection decreased the odds of self-reported long COVID by 41.1% in adults aged 18 to 69 years (UK, 26 April 2020 to 30 November 2021). 
Long COVID symptoms of any severity were reported by 9.5% of double-vaccinated study participants, compared with 14.6% of those who were unvaccinated when infected. Long COVID symptoms severe enough to limit day-to-day activities were reported by 5.5% of double-vaccinated compared with 8.7% of unvaccinated participants. 
There was no statistical evidence that these associations were different depending on type of vaccine received - either adenovirus vector (Oxford/AstraZeneca) or mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) vaccines.

Secondary school pupils were much more likely to have reported a positive test (either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or lateral flow device (LFD)) in the Autumn 2020 term, compared with primary school pupils. Around 1 in 10 secondary school pupils (10.5%) reported a positive test, compared with 1.5% of primary school pupils. In the Autumn 2021 term, there was a smaller difference between primary and secondary school pupils. 
Students were less likely to report symptoms with a positive test in the Autumn 2021 term than in the Autumn 2020 term. Around half of pupils who tested positive had symptoms in the Autumn 2021 term, compared with around 7 in 10 in the Autumn 2020 term. This may be explained by the introduction of LFD testing and more cases without symptoms being identified.

White British pupils were most likely to report positive COVID-19 tests in the Autumn 2021 term Percentage of secondary-aged pupils in state-funded schools reporting positive coronavirus tests by ethnicity and term, England, up to 22 December 2021 Source: ONS Linked English Schools Census (DfE), NHS Test and Trace (T&T) and National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) dataset Download this chart White British pupils were most likely to report positive COVID-19 tests in the Autumn 2021 term Image.csv.xls
There were large variations in the percentage of primary and secondary pupils reporting positive COVID-19 tests by ethnicity in Autumn 2021. White British primary and secondary pupils were most likely to report a positive test (16.6% and 24.9%, respectively). Some ethnic groups (for example, White British, White Irish and Chinese) saw more than double the proportion reporting a positive test compared with the same period in 2020. 
In the Autumn 2020 term, there was less variation between ethnic groups. Indian pupils (11.3%) were most likely to report a positive test among secondary age pupils and Pakistani pupils (2.5%) were most likely to report a positive test among primary age pupils.

Compared with unvaccinated pupils, those aged 12 to 15 years who had received one vaccine dose more than 14 days ago: 
were 38% less likely to report a positive test in the first half of the Autumn 2021 term (20 September to 3 November 2021)
were 23% less likely to report a positive test in the second half of the Autumn 2021 term (4 November to 17 December 2021) 
The lower estimates in the second half of the Autumn term may reflect waning protection and reduced vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant, which became more common towards the end of the term. 
This analysis controlled for differences in the characteristics between vaccinated and unvaccinated pupils.

 The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) and REACT study both track COVID-19 infections in the community, excluding people in hospitals, care homes and other institutional settings. They test randomly selected individuals that might or might not be experiencing symptoms. Their positivity rates are modelled estimates adjusted to represent the population. NHS Test and Trace data refer to people tested because of specific reasons. These might include people experiencing symptoms, being in contact with a known case or employer referral. NHS Test and Trace data includes new cases in the community, hospitals and care homes.

67,"Behavioural characteristics and positive coronavirus (COVID-19) tests
People who had any physical contact with those aged under 18 years were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than people who had not.
This is one of several behavioural characteristics associated with testing positive identified for the fortnight ending 29 January 2022, while taking other demographics and characteristics into account. 
In the same time period of the fortnight ending 29 January 2022:
 - school aged children who reported never wearing a face covering at school were more likely to test positive than children who reported always wearing a face covering.
 - School aged children who reported not needing to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces were more likely to test positive than children who reported always wearing a face covering.
 - People who had 1 to 10 physical contacts with 18- to 69-year-olds were more likely to test positive than people who had no physical contact with 18- to 69-year-olds.
 - Those who spent more time socialising with others outside their household continued to be more likely to test positive.
 - Adults who reported sometimes or never wearing a face covering at work were more likely to test positive than adults who reported always wearing a face covering.

White British pupils were most likely to report positive COVID-19 tests in the Autumn 2021 term Percentage of secondary-aged pupils in state-funded schools reporting positive coronavirus tests by ethnicity and term, England, up to 22 December 2021 Source: ONS Linked English Schools Census (DfE), NHS Test and Trace (T&T) and National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) dataset Download this chart White British pupils were most likely to report positive COVID-19 tests in the Autumn 2021 term Image.csv.xls
There were large variations in the percentage of primary and secondary pupils reporting positive COVID-19 tests by ethnicity in Autumn 2021. White British primary and secondary pupils were most likely to report a positive test (16.6% and 24.9%, respectively). Some ethnic groups (for example, White British, White Irish and Chinese) saw more than double the proportion reporting a positive test compared with the same period in 2020. 
In the Autumn 2020 term, there was less variation between ethnic groups. Indian pupils (11.3%) were most likely to report a positive test among secondary age pupils and Pakistani pupils (2.5%) were most likely to report a positive test among primary age pupils.

Compared with unvaccinated pupils, those aged 12 to 15 years who had received one vaccine dose more than 14 days ago: 
were 38% less likely to report a positive test in the first half of the Autumn 2021 term (20 September to 3 November 2021)
were 23% less likely to report a positive test in the second half of the Autumn 2021 term (4 November to 17 December 2021) 
The lower estimates in the second half of the Autumn term may reflect waning protection and reduced vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant, which became more common towards the end of the term. 
This analysis controlled for differences in the characteristics between vaccinated and unvaccinated pupils.

 The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) and REACT study both track COVID-19 infections in the community, excluding people in hospitals, care homes and other institutional settings. They test randomly selected individuals that might or might not be experiencing symptoms. Their positivity rates are modelled estimates adjusted to represent the population. NHS Test and Trace data refer to people tested because of specific reasons. These might include people experiencing symptoms, being in contact with a known case or employer referral. NHS Test and Trace data includes new cases in the community, hospitals and care homes.

69,"COVID-19 case rates highest for the White British ethnic group during the third wave
The socio-demographic groups at highest risk of infection have changed over the course of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
After adjusting for personal characteristics, the case rate was highest in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups during the second wave (1 September 2020 to 22 May 2021), but it has been highest in the White British ethnic group since the start of the third wave (23 May 2021). 
However, these patterns differ by age groups, particularly in the third wave. 
While case rates were lower in the Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic groups than in the White British ethnic group among people aged below 65 years, it was higher among people aged 65 years and over. This may partly explain the continued higher risk of mortality during the third wave for these groups compared with the White British ethnic group. 
Case rates have been adjusted for age and sex, and further adjusted for geography, socio-economic factors and pre-existing health conditions. 
In the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, case rates were higher in households from lower socio-economic groups than in more affluent ones. However, in the third wave there was little difference between socio-economic groups, other than those who had never worked or were long-term unemployed, who had the lowest rates. 
Case rates also differed by religion, with people identifying as Muslim or Sikh having the highest rates in the second wave, whereas the Christian group had the highest rates in the third.

Patterns in case rates varied by age group; in the third wave, among those aged under 65, the odds of testing positive were highest for the White British group, but among people aged 65 years and over, the odds of testing positive, when compared with the White British group, were notably higher for the Bangladeshi (49% higher) and Pakistani (46% higher) ethnic groups.
Case rates also differed by religious affiliation, with people identifying as Muslim or Sikh having the highest rates in the second wave, whereas the Christian group had the highest rates in the third wave.
In the second wave, case rates were higher in households from lower socio-economic backgrounds than in more affluent ones; in the third wave there was little difference between socio-economic groups other than those who had never worked or were long-term unemployed, who had the lowest rates.

70,"Percentage of workforce self-isolating by sector 
The percentage of people self-isolating increased in the social care, teaching and education and health care sectors in the two weeks ending 29 January 2022. 
The sectors with the highest percentage of the workforce in self-isolation due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) were social care (4.0%) and teaching and education (3.9%), with 95% confidence intervals. The retail sector had the lowest estimated percentage of the workforce in self-isolation at 2.2%. 
On 29 January 2022, the social care, health care, and food production, agriculture and farming sector reached estimates within one percentage point of their early January peak. It is estimated that the teaching and education sector may have passed its early January peak. 
Overall, in England, the percentage of the working-age population self-isolating increased in the two weeks ending 29 January 2022 (to 2.7% from 2.2% on 15 January 2022). In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of the working-age population self-isolating due to COVID-19 showed some possible signs of an increase in the two weeks ending 29 January 2022 but with high uncertainty.

71,"Half of COVID-19 pandemic homeworkers report lower spending
Over a third of workers (36%) reported having worked from home at least once in the past seven days, according to responses to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) between 19 and 30 January 2022. 
Nearly half (46%) of these homeworkers reported their spending has reduced as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In contrast, around 2 in 10 (18%), said their spending had risen and 28% said it had stayed the same. 
Homeworkers most commonly reported reduced spending on commuting, with 50% seeing spending fall on fuel and parking costs for commuting, and 40% spending less on commuting by public transport. 
However, 86% reported higher spending on utilities since working from home, and almost a quarter said they spent more on internet.

Question: ""Which, if any of these, are you spending less/more money on now that you are working from home more?""
Base: Working adults who reported working from home in the past seven days because of COVID-19 between the 19 and 30 of January 2022.
Respondents were able to choose more than one option.

Almost half (46%) of these homeworkers said they spent less as a result of homeworking because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A similar proportion of homeworkers reported spending less when interviewed in November (49%).
The area where homeworkers most commonly saw spending increase was utility bills, where 86% reported their spending had risen.
Half of homeworkers (50%) reported spending less on fuel and parking for commuting, and two fifths (40%) reported spending less on commuting using public transport.
Around 9 in 10 homeworkers who live in rented housing (92%) reported increased spending on utilities, compared with 86% of those who are currently paying a mortgage and 77% of homeworkers who own their home outright.
Homeworkers with dependent children are slightly more likely to report increased spending on food (39%), utilities (89%), and internet access (27%) than those without dependent children (29%, 85% and 23%) respectively.
The percentage of people homeworking is positively correlated with the stringency of COVID-19 restrictions and negatively correlated with aggregate spending on debit and credit cards.

72,"Infections decrease but remain high for primary school-age children
The percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased but remained very high for those aged 2 years to school Year 6 in the week ending 5 February 2022. 
In the same week, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those in school Year 12 to age 24 and for those aged 50 years and over. Trends were uncertain for other age groups in the most recent week. 
Trends were mixed in UK nations, with the infection rate rising in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the week ending 5 February but falling in Wales. The trend was uncertain in England in the most recent week. 
The Omicron BA.1 variant is currently the dominant variant across the UK; the sub-variant BA.2 has increased substantially in Northern Ireland and some regions of England. 
The estimated number of people living in private households (not in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments) that had COVID-19 in the most recent week was: 
 - England – 2,824,700 people (1 in 19)
 - Wales – 121,200 people (1 in 25)

73,"Coronavirus lockdowns affect homicide trends
Restrictions on social contact during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns appear to have affected the number and type of homicides in England and Wales.
Data from the Home Office’s Homicide Index for the year ending March 2021 show that while there was a 16% decrease in the number of male homicide victims (495 to 416), the number of female victims was the same as last year (177).
A headline reduction in homicides of 12% (from 515 to 594) during this period masks a change in trends in homicides committed inside and outside a domestic setting.
While there was a substantial fall in the number of victims who were killed in public places compared with last year (a 27% decrease), there was a 5% increase in victims who were killed in a residential setting, which may explain the different trends between males and females. 
There was a 17% decrease, from 508 to 420, in the number of non-domestic homicides, which are more likely to take place in a public place. The number of domestic homicides (114), which were more likely to occur in a residence, was similar to the previous year. 
Daily life was turned on its head during lockdown, with our high streets and entertainment venues empty and families staying at home for longer periods of time. 
The homicide rate remains relatively low in England and Wales, as a proportion of the population: there were 9.9 per million of population during the year ending March 2021. This is the lowest since the year ending March 2016.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2021,"There were 594 homicide victims in the year ending March 2021, 79 fewer (a 12% decrease) than the previous year and the lowest number since the year ending March 2016 (540 victims).
The preceding year (ending March 2020) included the 39 victims found in a lorry in Grays, Essex and if this incident is excluded from that year, there would have been a smaller (6%) year-on-year decrease.
The year ending March 2021 covered certain time periods where coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were in place to limit social contact; these restrictions may have led to a reduction in homicide in this year.
The homicide rate was 9.9 per million population, with the rate for males (14 per million population) more than twice that for females (6 per million population).
The headline reduction of 12% from the previous year masked different trends between males and females; the number of male victims decreased by 16% (495 to 416) whereas the number of female victims was the same as last year (177 victims).
Although there was a substantial fall in the number of victims who were killed in public places compared with last year (a 27% decrease), there was a 5% increase in victims who were killed in a residential setting, which may explain the different trends between males and females.
There were 114 domestic homicides in the year ending March 2021, a similar number to the average over the last five years.
For those homicide victims where a suspect had been charged, 92% (380) of victims had suspects who were male.

81,"Risk of COVID-19 death lowest among triple jabbed
The age-adjusted risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) is consistently lower among those who have received at least three vaccines compared with unvaccinated people. 
This is true for all age groups. 
In England between July and December 2021, the mortality risk was 93.4% lower for people who had received a third dose, or booster at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people. 
Among people who had received their second dose at least 21 days ago, the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19 was 81.2% lower than those who were unvaccinated for the period July to December 2021. 
The age-adjusted mortality rates are not equivalent to measures of vaccine effectiveness, which is reported in the COVID-19 Infection Survey. 
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1januaryand31december2021,"In the period July to December 2021, the age-adjusted risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) was 93.4% lower for people who had received a third dose, or booster, at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people. 
In the period July to December 2021, the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19 was 81.2% lower for people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people; for January to June 2021, this was 99.5% lower. 
The monthly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for death involving COVID-19 have been consistently lower for all months since booster introduction in September 2021 for people who had received a third dose, or booster, at least 21 days ago, compared with unvaccinated people; this is the case for all age groups.
The monthly ASMRs for death involving COVID-19 have been consistently lower for people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people, until October 2021 but increased in November and December 2021, particularly in older age groups; this may be driven by a change in the composition of the group with most people in older age groups having received a third dose, or booster, or waning protection from prior vaccination.
The age-adjusted rates are not equivalent to measures of vaccine effectiveness; they account for differences in age structure and population size but there may be other differences between the groups, particularly underlying health, which affect the mortality rates.
Changes in non-COVID-19 mortality by vaccination status are largely driven by the changing composition of the vaccination status groups because of the prioritisation of clinically extremely vulnerable and people with underlying health conditions, and differences in timing of vaccination among people who were eligible.

86,"35% of vaccinated contacts never intended to report test results
The majority of fully vaccinated people (70%) did daily lateral flow testing after being in contact with a positive coronavirus (COVID-19) case in January 2022, in line with government guidance. 
However, more than a third (35%) of those who took part in daily testing never intended to report their results. 
Almost half (46%) of those who took daily tests had difficulty in obtaining them. Of those who experienced difficulties, the most common reason was no availability (82%). 
This is based on responses to the COVID Test and Trace Contacts Behavioural Insights Survey in England, collected between 10 and 15 January 2022.

88,"Just under a quarter of parents unlikely to have children vaccinated
Of pupils aged 5 to 11 years, 24% had parents who said they were unlikely to agree to their child having a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. Parents of 62% of pupils said they were “fairly” or “very likely” to agree to their child having a COVID-19 vaccine.
Over half of parents who didn’t want their children to have a COVID-19 vaccine (54%) said that they worried about the side effects. Meanwhile, 49% said they wanted to wait to see how the vaccine worked.
We found that 70% of pupils aged 12 to 18 years taking part in our survey said they had been vaccinated. Official published vaccination figures suggest that on 15 December 2021 when the study closed, 45.9% of 12- to 15-year-olds and 61.5% of 16-to 17-year-olds had received a COVID-19 vaccine.

Pupils living in more deprived areas are much less likely to have been vaccinated. Just over one in three (36.1%) had been vaccinated in the 10% most deprived areas of England, compared with 70.3% in the 10% least deprived.
Schools with higher proportions of pupils eligible for free school meals also had lower vaccination rates. Schools with more than half of their pupils eligible for free school meals had an average vaccination rate of 29.2%, compared with 73.2% for schools where less than 5% were eligible.
Pupils who speak English as an additional language were much less likely to have been vaccinated (38.2%) than those who spoke English as their first language (55.5%), as were pupils with special education needs (48.1% compared with 53.5% without special educational needs).
Vaccination uptake varied between ethnic groups, even after controlling for demographic and socio-economic differences. Chinese and Indian pupils were most likely to have received at least one dose (75.5% and 65.7% respectively), while Gypsy and Roma, and Black Caribbean pupils were least likely (both 12.4%).

91,"Four in five health professionals have had three vaccinations
As of 31 December 2021, 64.9% of adults aged 18 to 64 years who were employed in England had received three coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations, while 8.8% were unvaccinated. 
Among occupation groups, health professionals (80.4%) and teaching and other educational professionals (76.0%) were most likely to have received three vaccinations. They were also the least likely to be unvaccinated (4.2% and 4.8% respectively). 
However, many occupations that require working in close physical proximity to others had low vaccination coverage. 
The rate of receiving three vaccinations was lowest among bar staff (38.1%), followed by beauticians and related occupations (38.8%), waiters and waitresses (38.8%) and roofers, roof tilers and slaters (42.6%). 
Combining data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) and information on occupation collected as part of the 2021 Census, we examined differences in vaccination coverage between occupations. 
Vaccination rates are estimated by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) 2020 sub-major occupation groups and unit group occupations, referred to as occupation groups and occupations respectively. 
The differences in vaccination status between occupation groups are not driven by differences in age, as the ranking largely remained unchanged after adjusting for age. 
Data may differ from weekly administrative vaccination data published by NHS England.

The occupation groups with the lowest proportion of people who had received three vaccinations were elementary trades and related occupations (48.0%) and elementary administration and service occupations (52.3%); these groups also had the highest and third highest proportion of people who had not received a vaccination at 18.1% and 13.6% respectively.
The differences in vaccination status between occupation groups are not driven by differences in age, as the ranking largely remained unchanged after adjusting for age.
Within occupation groups, there was large variation in vaccination coverage between occupations; for instance, within the health professionals' group, 90.5% of specialist medical practitioners had received three vaccinations, compared with 66.4% of therapy professionals not elsewhere classified.
Occupations that require working in close physical proximity to others had large variation in vaccination coverage, with the proportion of people who had received three vaccinations being highest among specialist medical practitioners (90.5%), specialist nurses (87.2%), generalist medical practitioners (87.2%) and head teachers and principals (86.8%) and lowest in bar staff (38.1%), beauticians and related occupations (38.8%), waiters and waitresses (38.8%) and roofers, roof tilers and slaters (42.6%).

92,"Fraud and hacking increased during lockdowns
Fraud offences increased by 36% in England and Wales in the year ending September 2021 compared with the year ending September 2019.
Estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed there were 5.1 million fraud offences in the year ending September 2021, a time when parts of England and Wales were subject to coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions.
While the number of many offences decreased during periods of national lockdowns, fraud and computer misuse increased.
The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) estimated: 
 - a 14% increase in total crime, driven by a 47% increase in fraud and computer misuse
 - crime excluding fraud and computer misuse decreased by 14%, largely driven by an 18% decrease in theft offences.
“Advance fee fraud”, where victims are encouraged to transfer money to criminals in return for postal goods, “consumer retail fraud” and “other fraud”, contributed to this increase in fraud offences. This could be evidence of fraudsters taking advantage of a switch in behaviour, such as an increase in shopping online.
The survey also revealed an 89% increase in computer misuse offences such as hacking compared with the year ending September 2019. This was largely driven by a 161% increase in “unauthorised access to personal information” including hacking. This also included the large-scale data breaches and the compromise of email or social media accounts.
There were an estimated 1.9 million computer misuse offences in the year ending September 2021.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2021,"Patterns of crime in the year ending September 2021 have been significantly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and government restrictions on social contact. There was significant variation in the level of restrictions in place across this time period and, at times, further variation across regions. This creates a challenge in isolating the level of impact that restrictions may have had on patterns of crime. 
The number of incidents decreased for many types of crime during periods of national lockdowns. However, police recorded crime data show indications that over the last six months, certain offence types are returning to or exceeding the levels seen before the pandemic. This pattern has not yet emerged in the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW)1 data, possibly reflecting the time lag in recording incidents via the survey. 
Fraud and computer misuse offences do not follow the lockdown-related pattern of reduced victimisation, and increases in these offences more than offset the reductions seen for other types of crime.
Overall, Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) estimates provide the best indicator of long-term trends in crime. Estimates from the TCSEW for the year ending September 2021 compared with the pre-coronavirus year ending September 20192 show:
a 14% increase in total crime, driven by a 47% increase in fraud and computer misuse
crime excluding fraud and computer misuse decreased by 14%, largely driven by an 18% decrease in theft offences

93,"Double vaccinated less likely to report long COVID
Those who have received two doses of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination appear less likely to develop long COVID symptoms than those who are unvaccinated when infected.
Receiving a second dose at least two weeks before infection was associated with a 41.1% decrease in the likelihood of self-reported long COVID at least 12 weeks later. 
These results come from a sample of UK adults aged 18 to 69 years where comparisons are made between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants with similar socio-demographic characteristics.
This analysis was based on data to 30 November 2021 and does not assess the impact of booster doses and the Omicron variant. Also, the observational nature of the analysis means that we cannot say whether COVID-19 vaccination caused subsequent changes in the likelihood of self-reported long COVID.
Long COVID symptoms were reported by 9.5% of double-vaccinated participants, compared with 14.6% of participants who were unvaccinated when infected. Estimates for long COVID symptoms severe enough to limit day-to-day activities were 5.5% and 8.7% respectively.

This analysis was based on data to 30 November 2021, and longer follow-up time is needed to assess the impact of booster doses and the Omicron variant; furthermore, the observational nature of the analysis means that we cannot say whether COVID-19 vaccination caused subsequent changes in the likelihood of self-reported long COVID.
Long COVID symptoms of any severity were reported by 9.5% of double-vaccinated study participants, compared with 14.6% of socio-demographically similar participants who were unvaccinated when infected; the corresponding estimates for long COVID symptoms severe enough to result in limitation to day-to-day activities were 5.5% and 8.7% respectively.
There was no statistical evidence that the relationship between vaccination status at the time of infection and the likelihood of subsequently reporting long COVID symptoms differed by whether participants received adenovirus vector (Oxford/AstraZeneca) or mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) vaccines.

94,"Almost four in five COVID-19 cases adhere to self-isolation
The majority (79%) of respondents who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) fully adhered to self-isolation requirements, broadly in line with the levels reported for November (75%) and December 2021 (74%). 
Adherence to self-isolation requirements was lower between the onset of symptoms and receiving a positive test result (76%), compared with the 24 hours following a positive result (97%) and the remainder of the self-isolation period (91%).

95,"Risk of COVID-19 death higher for most ethnic minority groups
During the third wave of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (13 June 2021 to 1 December 2021), the risk of death involving COVID-19 was higher for people from all ethnic minority groups except for Chinese men and women, men from the “Mixed” group, and women from the “White other” group.
During this period, the Bangladeshi group had the highest rate of death involving COVID-19; the rate was 5.2 times higher than the rate seen in the White British group for females and 4.4 times higher for males.
Location, measures of disadvantage, occupation, living arrangements, pre-existing health conditions and vaccination status accounted for a large proportion of the excess risk of COVID-19 death involving COVID-19 in most ethnic minority groups. 
This new analysis of the period since the vaccination programme began shows that the lower vaccination coverage in some ethnic groups also contributes to the elevated risk of death involving COVID-19, particularly in the Black African and Black Caribbean groups.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/updatingethniccontrastsindeathsinvolvingthecoronaviruscovid19englandandwales/8december2020to1december2021,"Between 8 December 2020 (the start of the vaccination programme) and 12 June 2021 (the approximate end of the second wave of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic), people from all ethnic minority groups (except the Chinese group and women in the White other ethnic group) had higher rates of death involving COVID-19 compared with the White British population.
During this period, the rate of death involving COVID-19 was highest for the Bangladeshi ethnic group (5.0 times greater than the White British group for males, and 4.5 times greater for females), followed by the Pakistani (3.1 for males, 2.6 for females) and Black African (2.4 for males, 1.7 for females) ethnic groups.
Since the start of the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic (from 13 June 2021 onwards) the rate of death involving COVID-19 was higher for all ethnic minority groups (except Chinese people, men from the Mixed ethnic group and women from the White other ethnic group); the risk remained highest for the Bangladeshi ethnic group (4.4 and 5.2 times greater than for the White British ethnic group for males and females, respectively).
Location, measures of disadvantage, occupation, living arrangements, pre-existing health conditions and vaccination status accounted for a large proportion of the excess rate of death involving COVID-19 in most ethnic minority groups; however, the Bangladeshi ethnic group and men from the Pakistani ethnic group remained at higher risk than White British people in the third wave, even after adjusting for vaccination status.
Males and females of Black Caribbean and Black African background were at elevated risk in the third wave after adjusting for location, measures of disadvantage, occupation, living arrangements, pre-existing health conditions; after also adjusting for vaccination status, there was no evidence that the risk was greater than for the White British ethnic group.

96,"Coronavirus antibodies increasing in children
In the week beginning 3 January 2022, an estimated 88% to 92% of children aged 12 to 15 years would have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies. 
The percentage of children aged 8 to 11 years who would have tested positive for antibodies in the same week was between 38% and 60%. Children under 12 years are not currently eligible for vaccination, so antibodies in this age group are most likely a result of previous infection. 
Antibody levels remain high among the UK adult population. An estimated 98% of people aged 16 years and over in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland would have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in the week beginning 3 January 2022. In Wales 97% of adults would have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. 
This week, we have also reported antibody positivity levels based on a higher antibody threshold, which reflects a higher concentration of antibodies, and therefore a strong protection against developing COVID-19. 
In the week beginning 3 January 2022, between 94.1% to 96.3% of the adult population across the UK would have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies at or above the higher antibody threshold with the booster programme likely leading to the rapid increases in antibodies above this threshold seen in older age groups.

102,"Price of food pushes up inflation
Consumer prices rose by 4.8% in the 12 months to December 2021, according to the lead measure of the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH). This is up from 4.6% in the year to November 2021. 
Annual inflation rates at this time are influenced by the effects of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020. Our blog post, Beware Base Effects, describes how price movements for some items during that period influence current inflation rates.
The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) also rose to 5.4% in December 2021 from 5.1% in November 2021. A wide range of prices contributed to the rise in the 12-month inflation rate, with the largest upward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate coming from food and non-alcoholic beverages, with eight of the nine food groups providing an upwards contribution.

For people in school Year 7 to school Year 11 and groups aged between 25 and 49 years, the trend in the percentage testing positive was uncertain in the last few days of 2021.
This may mean that infections are no longer increasing among these age groups, but it is currently too early to suggest if this is a continuing change in trend. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.
As published on 5 January 2021, data for the week ending 31 December 2021 showed an increase in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 in all regions of England as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, in the week ending 31 December 2021.
The estimated number of people living in private households who had COVID-19 in the most recent week was:
 - England – 3,270,800 people (1 in 15)
 - Wales – 157,900 people (1 in 20)
 - Northern Ireland – 72,900 people (1 in 25)

Our headline results published on Wednesday 5 January 2022 are available to view. The analysis in this bulletin provides further breakdowns for the same period and a longer time series.
In England, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 continued to increase in the week ending 31 December 2021; we estimate that 3,270,800 people in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 3,163,500 to 3,377,500), equating to around 1 in 15 people.
In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 continued to increase in the week ending 31 December 2021; we estimate that 157,900 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 138,900 to 179,600), equating to around 1 in 20 people.
In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 continued to increase in the week ending 31 December 2021; we estimate that 72,900 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 56,800 to 90,100), equating to around 1 in 25 people.

108,"Fewer worried about pandemic impact than at this time last year
About two in three adults (66%) reported being very or somewhat worried about the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on their life, when asked between 15 December 2021 and 3 January 2022.
This figure is down from 75% at a similar time last year. However, it has increased from 56% since the last data collection period between 1 and 12 December 2021.
Although people seem less concerned about the impact of the pandemic compared with the start of last year, the proportion of people who do not expect life to return to normal for more than a year has risen from 20% to 35% during the same period.
The proportion of people who reported wearing a face covering remained high at 96%, up from 94% at the previous survey period and close to the 97% recorded a year ago.
Meanwhile, there was a significant increase in the perception of others wearing face coverings. About two in three adults (66%) said they saw everyone or almost everyone wearing face coverings in shops, compared with 47% in the previous period.

Around two-thirds (66%) of adults reported having received two coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines and a booster (compared with 46% in the previous period). 
Around 1 in 10 (9%) adults had been asked to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test in the past seven days (excluding when travelling abroad) (8% in the previous period).
Almost 6 in 10 adults (57%) said they had taken a rapid lateral flow test in the past seven days (42% in the previous period), with higher proportions of younger people taking one compared with older people.
The proportion of adults working from home at some point in the past seven days remained stable in this period (32%) while there was a fall in those reporting travelling to work at some point (60%) (compared with 32% and 72% respectively in the period 1 to 12 December 2021).
Around 4 in 10 (43%) adults reported they always or often maintained social distancing when outside their home in the past seven days, while over 6 in 10 adults (63%) reported they avoided physical contact with others outside their home in the past seven days; these proportions were higher among older people and those who reported they are clinically extremely vulnerable.
During the Christmas season, over 6 in 10 adults (63%) reported they planned to visit (or had already visited) family or friends in their homes, while around half (51%) planned to have (or had already had) family or friends visit them in their home; around three-quarters (73%) planned to stay (or stayed) at home if feeling unwell to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 (80% in the previous period).

110,"Long COVID continues to affect more than a million people
An estimated 1.3 million people (2%) in private households in the UK reported having long COVID in the four weeks to 6 December 2021.
Of people with self-reported long COVID, 21% (270,000 people) first had (or suspected they had) coronavirus (COVID-19) less than 12 weeks previously. 
Those who first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously made up 70% (892,000 people), and 40% (506,000 people) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least one year previously. 
Of the proportion of people with self-reported long COVID whose symptoms adversely affected their day-to-day activities, 20% reported their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been “limited a lot”.
Fatigue continued to be the most commonly reported symptom, applying to 51% of those with self-reported long COVID. This was followed by 37% with loss of smell, 36% with shortness of breath and 28% who had difficulty in concentrating. The proportions amount to more than 100% because some people have experienced more than one symptom. 
As a proportion of the UK population, prevalence of self-reported long COVID was greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, people living in more deprived areas, those working in health care and social care, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability. 
Those in teaching and education also showed greater prevalence of self-reported long COVID. This represents the biggest month-on-month increase out of all employment sectors.

116,"Shopping and dining fall on pre-coronavirus levels amid Omicron fears 
The number of shoppers and diners across the UK has fallen compared with pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) levels as the Omicron variant has emerged. 
The seven-day average of UK seated diners fell by 14 percentage points in the week to 20 December 2021, to 88% of the level in the equivalent week of 2019. 
This is the lowest level since indoor dining reopened in England, Wales and Scotland (17 May 2021), and it is the first time numbers have fallen below pre-coronavirus levels (100%) since then. 
Despite overall retail footfall seeing a 6 percentage point increase on the previous week, it is lower when compared with pre-coronavirus levels (81%). 
In the previous week, overall retail footfall was 82% of the level- seen in the equivalent week of 2019. 
Shopping centre retail footfall was at 73% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. This is the lowest relative level since the week beginning 25 July 2021. 
It follows a previous high of 84% of the level of the equivalent week of 2019, which occurred in the week beginning 24 October 2021. 
These lower levels of retail footfall may be because of more cautious behaviour caused by the emergence of the Omicron variant of coronavirus.

117,"COVID-19 antibodies rising with booster rollout
The percentage of adults in older age groups who would test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies has risen alongside the vaccine booster programme. 
Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to fight off infection. 
In the week beginning 29 November 2021, there were increases in antibody positivity among those aged over 65 years in England, Wales and Scotland, and among those aged over 70 years in Northern Ireland. 
Download the data for antibody positivity rates, (XLS, 73.4KB)
There has been an increase in antibody positivity in those aged 65 years and over across the UK since early October 2021, likely because of the booster programme. 
It is too early to provide information on the effectiveness of vaccinations against the Omicron variant. 
Across the UK in the week to 29 November 2021, it was estimated that: 
 - in England 95% of adults would have tested positive for antibodies (credible interval: 94.2% to 95.7%)
 - in Wales 93.6% of adults would have tested positive for antibodies (credible interval: 92.3% to 94.8%)

119,"COVID-19 deaths affect a rise in mortality rate 
The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) for deaths due to coronavirus (COVID-19) increased significantly in England in November 2021.
There were 69.3 deaths per 100,000 people due to COVID-19 in England in November 2021, compared with 50.8 in October 2021 – a statistically significant increase.
The rate for Wales was 106.4 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 97.6 in October 2021, but it was not a statistically significant increase.
November 2021 is the third consecutive month where the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 in Wales was higher than in England.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) was the third leading cause of death in November 2021, in both England and Wales.
These deaths accounted for 6.6% of all deaths in England and 9.0% of all deaths in Wales respectively.

Today, we have published new data that show in the week ending 23 December 2021:
In England, the percentage of people testing positive continued to increase; we estimate that 2,024,700 people in England had coronavirus (COVID-19) (95% credible interval: 1,951,200 to 2,096,300), equating to around 1 in 25 people.
In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive continued to increase; we estimate that 76,500 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 65,100 to 89,200), equating to around 1 in 40 people.
In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive increased; we estimate that 47,500 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 37,800 to 58,600), equating to around 1 in 40 people.
In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive continued to increase; we estimate that 135,400 people in Scotland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 117,400 to 154,800), equating to around 1 in 40 people.
In England, COVID-19 infections increased across all age groups and were highest among those aged two years to school Year 6 and those aged 25 to 34 years; the high infections for those aged two years to school Year 6 are more likely to be compatible with the Delta variant, whereas the high infections for those aged 25 to 34 years are more likely to be compatible with the Omicron variant, as shown by separate analysis.
COVID-19 infections increased across all regions of England, with the highest infection levels seen in London (1 in 15) and the lowest in the North East of England (1 in 45).
COVID-19 infections compatible with the Omicron variant continued to increase rapidly across England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and Omicron is now the most common variant in England and Scotland.

"
122,"COVID-19 mortality was consistently lower after two vaccine doses
Taking age into account, the risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) was consistently lower for people who had two vaccine doses at least 21 days before compared with those who were unvaccinated.
This was seen in all age groups over the period between 1 January and 31 October 2021.
The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) is not a measure of vaccine effectiveness and varies over time. This is because of changes in:
 - the composition of vaccination status groups (particularly differences in health)
 - infection rates
 - seasonal mortality rates
 - dominant variants
 - levels of immunity from prior infection
 - vaccine waning
As a result, the ASMR involving COVID-19 for those who had received two doses of a vaccine, compared with unvaccinated people, has changed over time.
In February 2021, the ASMR for deaths involving COVID-19 was 99% lower for people who had a second dose of a vaccine at least 21 days before than those who were unvaccinated. In October, it was 78% lower.
The ASMR for the whole period covered (1 January to 31 October 2021) was 96% lower among those who had a second dose at least three weeks before, compared with unvaccinated people.
In the following charts, ""person-years"" account for both the number of people and the amount of time spent in each vaccination status.
All-cause ASMRs for the year to date have been lower in the first three weeks after a vaccine dose. This could be because of a “‘healthy vaccinee effect”’ – as people who are ill are more likely to delay vaccination.
Non-COVID-19 mortality rates help show the impact of the changing composition of people in vaccination status on mortality rates.
Rates become higher as those who are clinically vulnerable and prioritised for vaccination move through these groups.
When the healthier population follow, there is a corresponding decrease in mortality rates.
In addition, when most people in an age group have been vaccinated, the small unvaccinated population has poorer health, resulting in higher mortality rates.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1januaryand31october2021,"The monthly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving COVID-19 have been consistently lower for people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago, compared with unvaccinated people. This is the case for all age groups.
The age-adjusted risk of deaths involving COVID-19 for people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated individuals varied from 99% lower (in February) to 78% lower (in October); this could be caused by various factors, such as changes in the composition of the group, changes in background COVID-19 infection rates, changing levels of immunity from prior infection, changing dominant variants, seasonal changes in mortality rates and vaccine waning.
The ASMRs calculated for specific months highlight changes over time, however they can become less meaningful if the population in a particular vaccination status group becomes very small, and less representative of the general population. Therefore we present the overall figure, which is less affected by composition effects, and the monthly figures over time, to show the changes over the year.
Over the whole period (1 January to 31 October 2021), the age-adjusted risk of deaths involving COVID-19 was 96% lower in people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people.
The age-adjusted rates are not equivalent to measures of vaccine effectiveness; they account for differences in age structure and population size but there may be other differences between the groups, particularly underlying health, which affect the mortality rates.
Changes in non-COVID-19 mortality by vaccination status are largely driven by the changing composition of the vaccination status groups because of the prioritisation of clinically extremely vulnerable and people with underlying health conditions, and differences in timing of vaccination among people who were eligible.

In late November, around 1 in 10 fully vaccinated people notified by NHS test and trace or via the app of contact with a positive case of COVID-19 subsequently tested positive for the virus. 
Over half of those notified (56%) reported taking a PCR test since being contacted, and 37% said they took a lateral flow test. 
Of those who received two doses of the vaccine, 19% developed symptoms, compared with 8% of those who had received two doses and the booster dose.

The proportion of adults that reported wearing a face covering when outside their home increased from 84% (between 18 and 28 November) to 94%, following the announcement making face coverings mandatory in certain settings in England from 30 November 2021.
The latest data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey also suggest that around half of adults (46%) have had two coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines and a booster. While 89% of those who have not received a booster said they would be very or fairly likely to if offered.
Prior to the recent approval of the mandatory use of COVID passes in some venues, fewer than 1 in 10 (8%) adults had been asked to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test in the past seven days (excluding for travel abroad).

127,"Third jab reduces risk of positive coronavirus (COVID-19) test
People who had received a third vaccine dose were less likely to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) than those who had a second dose in the fortnight to 28 November 2021. 
Those who reported having had a third dose at least two weeks before had a reduced risk of testing positive compared with those who had had their second dose of AstraZeneca or a second Pfizer dose more than 90 days ago. 
Third doses include booster vaccinations. 
In the fortnight to 28 November 2021, those who had received at least one vaccine dose remained less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than those who were unvaccinated.
People working in the education sector continued to be more likely to test positive for COVID-19 in comparison with other working adults in the latest period. 
This is likely linked to recent high infection levels among school-aged children. 
From 2 July 2020 to 29 November 2021, people who are unvaccinated were approximately three times more likely to be reinfected with COVID-19 than people who had their second vaccine 14 to 89 days ago.

128,"Young adults did not recover from coronavirus pandemic anxiety
While most well-being measures had recovered to pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) levels by spring 2021, anxiety levels remained very high among those aged 20 to 24 years.
Between April and June 2021, anxiety levels in this age group were much higher than the national average (3.56 compared with 3.04 out of 10 respectively).
This is a reversal of the usual trend; anxiety levels are usually highest in middle age (between 45 and 59 years). 
Employment rates among young people have been the most affected by the coronavirus pandemic, and those aged between 16 and 24 years were most likely to experience “lockdown loneliness” in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.
Overall measures of personal well-being across the UK were among the lowest levels ever recorded during the first two waves of COVID-19 cases, with these data collected since 2011 shows. 
By the end of the second wave (between April and June 2021), ratings for feeling that things done in life are worthwhile, happiness, and anxiety recovered to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic (between October and December 2019).

Soon after the start of the second wave, Quarter 4 2020, average ratings for happiness at the UK level fell to among the lowest scores in a decade (7.23 out of 10); anxiety rose to 3.43 out of 10, which was similar to the highest score recorded at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in Quarter 2 2020 
In Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021, anxiety fell by 0.20 points to 3.23 at the UK level; the decrease in anxiety was notable for people aged between 50 to 59 and 65 to 74 years, perhaps indicating a sense of optimism as vaccines continued to roll out. 
Improvements in life satisfaction, happiness or anxiety were observed for most age groups by Quarter 2 2021, except for young people (16 to 24 years), those aged between 35 and 39 years and those aged over 84 years.

The majority of adults (90%) who have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, but not a booster yet, said they would be very likely or fairly likely to have a booster vaccine if offered to them, while 5% said they would be very unlikely or fairly unlikely to have a booster vaccine if offered.
Fewer than 1 in 10 (7%) adults had been asked to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test in the past seven days (excluding for travel abroad), most commonly to attend a theatre or comedy performance (25%), an indoor concert (19%), a nightclub or bar (16%), a work or training event (14%) or a sporting event (11%).
Over a third (36%) of adults reported experiencing goods shortages in the past two weeks, with approximately 1 in 6 (17%) of all adults unable to buy essential food.
Around two-thirds (65%) of adults reported their cost of living has increased over the last month, with the most common reasons being an increase in the price of food shopping (87%), an increase in gas or electricity bills (77%) and an increase in the price of fuel (76%).

134,"Over 25,000 excess care resident deaths in 2020 in England and Wales
COVID-19 was the second highest leading cause of death in both male and female care home residents in England and Wales in 2020.
According to data from the Deaths in the care sector, England and Wales: 2020 release, 17.8% of male deaths in care homes and 14.2% of female deaths were caused by COVID-19. In Wales 19.1% of male deaths and 14.0% of female deaths were caused by COVID-19.
The leading cause of deaths in care homes in 2020 was dementia and Alzheimer's disease in both England and Wales. In England, 26.0% of male deaths and 34.3% of female deaths were caused by the diseases, meanwhile in Wales 26.6% of male deaths and 35.4% female deaths had the same cause.
In England there were 155,376 deaths of care home residents in 2020, which is an increase of 18.5% compared with 2019 (131,149 deaths) and 18.3% compared with the five-year average between 2015 and 2019. 
In Wales there were 8,236 deaths of care home residents in 2020, which is an increase of 20.3% compared to 2019 (6,849 deaths) and 17% compared with the five-year average between 2015 and 2019 (7,041 deaths).

Taking into account the population size and age structure, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) in England, for male and female care home residents, were statistically significantly higher in 2020 compared with the five previous years (11,193.3 deaths per 100,000 male care home residents, and 7,918.8 deaths per 100,000 female care home residents); ASMRs were statistically significantly higher for male compared with female care home residents in 2020.
In Wales, male care home residents had statistically significantly higher ASMRs in 2020 compared to the previous five years (9,381.4 deaths per 100,000 male care home residents) whereas females had statistically significantly higher ASMRs in 2020 (6773.9 deaths per 100,000 female care home residents) compared with 2017 only; ASMRs were significantly higher for male compared with female care home residents in 2020.
The North East continues to be the region of England with the highest ASMRs (11,245.9 deaths per 100,000 care home residents) and London was the region with the lowest (8,307.1 deaths per 100,000 care home residents); this difference was statistically significant.
Dementia and Alzheimer disease was the leading cause of death in both male and female care home residents in England (accounting for 26.0% and 34.3% of deaths respectively) and Wales (26.6% and 35.4% respectively) in 2020; COVID-19 was the second highest leading cause of death in both male and female care home residents in England (17.8% and 14.2% respectively) and Wales (19.1% and 14.0% respectively).
The majority of deaths of care home residents occurred within the care home in both England (86.6%) and Wales (83.5%).

135,"Almost 1 in 50 people in the UK living with long COVID
Around 1.2 million people living in private households in the UK were experiencing self-reported long COVID as of 31 October 2021.
This is around 1.9% of the population and almost 1 in 50 people. This number was roughly the same as it was on 2 October 2021.
Self-reported long COVID occurs when symptoms that are not explained by another health condition continue for more than four weeks after a person’s initial infection.
Of those with self-reported long COVID, more than a third (36%) had (or believed they had) been initially infected with coronavirus (COVID-19) at least one year earlier.
Symptoms limited the daily activities of close to two-thirds (64%) of those who self-reported long COVID. Close to one in five (19%) said their ability to do daily activities had been ""limited a lot"".

The estimates presented in this analysis relate to self-reported long COVID, as experienced by study participants who responded to a representative survey, rather than clinically diagnosed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 syndrome in the full population.
Of people with self-reported long COVID, 232,000 (19%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 less than 12 weeks previously; 862,000 people (71%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously, and 439,000 (36%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least one year previously.
The proportion of people with self-reported long COVID who reported that it reduced their ability to carry out daily activities remained stable compared with previous months; symptoms adversely affected the day-to-day activities of 775,000 people (64% of those with self-reported long COVID), with 232,000 (19%) reporting that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been “limited a lot”.
Fatigue continued to be the most common symptom reported as part of individuals' experience of long COVID (54% of those with self-reported long COVID), followed by shortness of breath (36%), loss of smell (35%), and difficulty concentrating (28%).
As a proportion of the UK population, prevalence of self-reported long COVID remained greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, people living in more deprived areas, those working in health or social care, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability.

137,"1 in 50 deaths of homeless people in 2020 involved COVID-19
There were an estimated 688 deaths of homeless people in England and Wales in 2020, of which 13 (1.9%) involved coronavirus (COVID-19).
The majority of deaths of homeless people involving COVID-19 occurred during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
In an earlier analysis, which included deaths where the registered address of the deceased was a hotel, [16 deaths of possible homeless people involving COVID-19 were registered up to 26 June 2020][1].
While the precise numbers are slightly different, both datasets indicate that COVID-19 was not a leading cause of death among homeless people in 2020.
The total number of deaths of homeless people fell in 2020 compared with 2019 (778 deaths); this was the first annual decline since 2014. However, the fall was not statistically significant.
Figures for 2020 may underestimate the true number of deaths of homeless people because of the impact of the Everyone In scheme, which has provided homeless people with emergency accommodation during the pandemic. It is difficult to identify deaths of homeless people housed under this scheme.

Of these, all 16 were identified in England and none were identified in Wales.
Most of the 16 identified deaths were of men, and the mean age at death was 58 years for males.
London (6 out of 16) and the North West (3 out of 16) were the regions with the highest numbers of identified deaths involving COVID-19 among people who were homeless.
These data have been developed rapidly; the official statistics of homeless deaths from all causes for 2020 will be published in late 2021.
The definition of homelessness in these data is similar to that used in the official statistics of deaths of homeless people, although people at risk of homelessness and other vulnerable groups may also be captured because of the respective policies of the UK government and Welsh Government during the pandemic.
No estimates have been made for unidentified homeless deaths through the capture-recapture method.

138,"Risk of reinfection higher during the Delta-dominant period 
The risk of reinfection was higher in the Delta-dominant period (after 17 May 2021) than during the Alpha-dominant period (before 17 May 2021). 
The reinfection rate is also higher for those with a long-term health condition and those is younger age groups, although the risk remains low.
People working in the education sector are more likely to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) than other working adults. 
Those living in a household with someone aged 16 years or under are also more likely to test positive. The higher risk is likely related to the recent high infection levels among school aged children.
The data from the fortnight ending 14 November 2021 also reveal that people who reported receiving three vaccinations (including booster vaccinations) were “less likely” to test positive than those who received their second dose of Astra Zeneca or Pfizer more than 90 days ago.

People working in the education sector continued to be more likely to test positive in comparison to other working adults in the fortnight ending 14 November 2021; the higher risk is likely related to the recent high infection levels among school-aged children.

139,"One in five students have had COVID-19 during the pandemic
Just over one in five students (21%) have had COVID-19 at some point during the coronavirus pandemic, which was confirmed with a positive test.
This is according to the latest findings from the Student COVID-19 Insights Survey (SCIS) in England, covering the period from 5 to 15 November 2021.
The majority (89%) of students said they had already had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, similar to late October (91%).
Almost half (49%) of students reported taking a COVID-19 test in the last seven days, while 9 in 10 students (90%) said they would request a test if they developed COVID-19 symptoms.
Meanwhile, the proportion of students feeling lonely often or always is 17%, significantly higher than 16- to 29-year-olds (9%) and the adult population in Great Britain (7%).

141,"Calls to domestic abuse helpline up during lockdowns
Peaks in the average number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline coincided with each of the three longest national lockdowns in England.
In the year ending March 2021, the number of callers to the helpline, run by the charity Refuge, in England increased by 22% to 49,756 compared with 40,859 in the year ending March 2020. 
A quarterly split of data for January 2020 to June 2021 showed that a spike in calls to the helpline from Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020 to Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2021 were concurrent with the three longest national lockdowns in England.
This is not necessarily indicative of an increase in the number of victims, but perhaps an increase in the severity of abuse being experienced, and a lack of available coping mechanisms.
Our overview also revealed that the number of police recorded domestic abuse-related crimes in England and Wales rose 6% in the year ending March 2021, from 798,607 in the year ending March 2020 to 845,734. This continues a trend seen in previous years.
The data also showed that, broken down by month, the percentage of domestic abuse-related crimes recorded by police in England and Wales was generally higher for each month in 2020 compared with the same months in 2018 and 2019. The largest percentages were generally seen in the months corresponding with the strictest restrictions of the first and third national lockdowns in April and May 2020 and then January and February 2021.

This publication is part of our domestic abuse statistics release. It brings together data from a range of different organisations to create a more coherent picture of how victims and perpetrators of domestic abuse interact with the criminal justice system and support services. It has been produced, working in collaboration with, and using data sources from:
Up-to-date statistics, and other commentary discussing domestic abuse in England and Wales, can be found in the most recent Domestic abuse in England and Wales overview. 
Throughout the release we present both official statistics and National Statistics. National Statistics are a subset of official statistics that have been certified by the UK Statistics Authority as compliant with its Code of Practice for Statistics.
Data from the following sources are classified as National Statistics:
Data from the following sources are classified as official statistics:
Other data included are from administrative datasets that do not fall within the scope of official statistics. 
This publication presents the stages of the criminal justice process in England and Wales for cases of domestic abuse. It describes how the data are captured at each stage of the process and provides important information about each data source. It should be viewed alongside the other publications and data in this release to aid understanding.
Figure 1 provides an overview of how cases of domestic abuse are captured and flow through the criminal justice system. The following sections of this publication provide detailed information on each stage of the process and the data sources available. Data from the criminal justice system are discussed in the latest Domestic abuse and the criminal justice system publication. For detailed definitions of terms referred to throughout this publication see the Glossary.
Following a single or repeated occurrence of domestic abuse, a victim may choose to tell someone or seek support. Alternatively, a third party (relative, friend, professional) may report on the victim’s behalf either with or without their knowledge.
In cases where a victim chooses not to report the matter to the police or to other domestic abuse services, the victim remains hidden from the police and the criminal justice system.
For cases where a victim does not report abuse to the police or to other domestic abuse services, they may be included in the statistics produced from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). The CSEW is a victimisation survey which asks people about their experiences of a range of crimes irrespective of whether they reported them to the police. A description of, and methodological information about, the face-to-face CSEW are available within the User guide to crime statistics and the Domestic abuse quality and methodology information (QMI) report.
The face-to-face CSEW was suspended on 17 March 2020 because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) replaced the CSEW and was specifically designed to allow us to continue measuring crime during this period. However, concerns around confidentiality and respondent safeguarding limited the types of questions asked in the TCSEW, specifically those relating to domestic abuse. As a result, CSEW and TCSEW data and estimates are not available in the Domestic abuse in England and Wales: November 2021 publication. Further information about the TCSEW can be found in section 2.1 of the User guide to crime in England and Wales: measuring crime during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Some victims seek help from support services or are referred to services by another agency, for example, health services. This can occur whether the case comes to the attention of the police or not. In cases which do come to the attention of the police, the victim may be referred to support services by the police. Alternatively, the victim may have reported the incident to the police following an interaction with support services.
In the Domestic abuse release we present a selection of data on the provision of domestic abuse victim services in England and Wales. These data are collected and held by a range of charities, and cover topics such as the availability of services and characteristics of service users.
Services data included are provided by:
These data are sourced from non-governmental, administrative datasets and are not classified as official statistics. Data on domestic abuse services reflect support offered to victims that become visible to these services.
The first recording stage in the criminal justice process begins when the police receive a report of an incident of domestic abuse. An incident can be reported to the police by victims, members of the public, or can be referred by a police officer or a “third party”, including professionals such as NHS staff and social workers. 
Domestic abuse-related incidents cover reports of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults, aged 16 years and over, who are or have been intimate partners or family members (regardless of gender or sexuality). The police, at this stage, will either:
The Home Office provides data on the number of domestic abuse-related incidents. To get a better picture of the demand upon the police that relates to domestic abuse, it is necessary to consider both domestic abuse-related incidents and crimes.
When the police record a report of domestic abuse as an incident, they must then assess whether or not an offence has been committed in accordance with the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS)1.
For cases that are recorded first as an incident, there are two possible outcomes. If it is concluded that a crime did not take place, the domestic abuse incident remains recorded as an incident. Alternatively, a crime, identified as domestic abuse-related, may be recorded in addition to the incident.
Not all reported crimes are recorded as an incident first. If it is clear when the incident is reported that an offence has occurred, the police may record the matter as a domestic abuse-related crime immediately without first recording an incident.
If it is concluded that an offence has been committed, either immediately when reported, or after being recorded as an incident, the matter will be recorded as a crime and will be identified as domestic abuse-related. 
The Home Office is responsible for the collation of recorded crime data supplied by the 43 territorial police forces of England and Wales, plus the British Transport Police1.
Offences that are domestic abuse-related will be recorded under the respective offence that has been committed, for example, assault with injury. This is because (with the exception of controlling or coercive behaviour) domestic abuse is not currently a specific criminal offence. 
The Home Office has been collecting information from the police on whether recorded offences are related to domestic abuse since April 20152, but it is not possible to determine how many crimes were domestic abuse-related prior to this date. This system relies on the police identifying offences as domestic abuse-related and it is possible that some offences may not be correctly identified.
Domestic abuse-related crimes include “controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship”3. Controlling or coercive behaviour was introduced as a specific criminal offence as part of the Serious Crime Act 2015 and came into force on 29 December 20154. 
Where data on domestic abuse-related crimes have been analysed by age and sex of the victim, data from the Home Office Data Hub5 are used. 
In addition to domestic abuse-related crimes, the Home Office also provides data on domestic homicides. These data are extracted from the Homicide Index which contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by the police in England and Wales. It is continually updated with revised information from the police and the courts and, as such, is a richer source of data than the main recorded crime dataset6. 
Homicides are recorded to be “domestic” when the relationship between a victim aged 16 years and over, and the perpetrator falls into one of the following categories:
These data exclude homicides where the victim was aged under 16 years, to be consistent with the government definition of domestic abuse used elsewhere in the release.
Homicide Index data are based on the year when the offence was recorded, not when the offence took place or when the case was heard in court. While in the majority of cases the offence will be recorded in the same year as it took place, this is not always the case. The data refer to the position as at a specific point in time, when the Homicide Index database is “frozen” for the purpose of analysis7. This will be stated alongside the findings throughout the release. The data may change as subsequent court hearings take place or as other information is received.
Analysis on data from the Homicide Index combines data for a three-year period to account for the year-to-year variability in the volume of homicides. Data on the number of domestic homicides by sex can be broken down by police force area but there is considerable volatility in these numbers over time because of the relatively low volumes involved. See the tables accompanying the release for more information. 
The Home Office also provides police recorded crime data on stalking and harassment offences identified as domestic abuse-related. Stalking and harassment offences include harassment, malicious communications, racially or religiously aggravated harassment, and stalking.
The 2017 report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), Living in fear – the police and CPS response to harassment and stalking (PDF, 957.7KB), highlights issues with police forces not recording offences of stalking and harassment cases accurately. HMICFRS found that some stalking and harassment incidents reported to the police were not recorded at all, and when incidents were recorded as crimes, stalking was often misidentified as harassment.
Once a domestic abuse-related crime is recorded, the police then conduct an investigation which aims to collect all evidence relevant to the case and identify a suspect. Following investigation, the police will assign an outcome to the offence:
Suspect charged following referral of case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS): in these cases, the police charge a suspect with an offence relating to domestic abuse following a decision by the CPS.
Case transferred: when, after further investigation, it becomes apparent that the offence took place in another police force area, this would lead to a crime being transferred to that police force for the investigation to be continued8.
No suspect is identified so case cannot proceed: although very rare for domestic abuse cases, sometimes the investigation does not identify a suspect (as the victim may be unwilling to give details); as such, the case does not proceed.
Suspect receives an out of court disposal, for example a caution: in some exceptional cases, the police may issue the suspect with a caution.
Crime report is cancelled: where, after further investigation, the police decide that a crime has not taken place and subsequently, the crime report is cancelled.
Decision that no further action will be taken: in some cases the police may decide that there is not enough evidence to take the case forward and take no further action; another example of when the police may be unable to pursue an investigation is where the offender has died before the case could be investigated or prosecuted.
Once the police have recorded a crime, they may arrest a suspect. HMICFRS collect data from police forces on arrests, bails and voluntary attendances for domestic abuse-related crimes9. The latest update report (PDF, 1047KB) by HMICFRS highlights concerns over the variation in arrest rates across police forces.
Police recorded crime data on outcomes of domestic abuse-related and non domestic abuse-related crimes are from the Home Office Data Hub. These data also provide information on the time taken to assign an outcome. 
For more information on how police forces submit their data to the Home Office, please refer to Section 3.1 of the User guide to crime statistics.
In response to a recommendation in the Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) 2014 report Everyone’s business: Improving the police response to domestic abuse, police forces are asked to “identify” crimes as being domestic abuse-related if the offence meets the government definition of domestic violence and abuse.
This offence is constituted by behaviour on the part of the perpetrator, which takes place “repeatedly or continuously”. The victim and alleged perpetrator must be “personally connected” at the time the behaviour takes place. The behaviour must have had a “serious effect” on the victim, meaning that it has caused the victim to fear violence will be used against them on “at least two occasions”, or it has had a “substantial adverse effect on the victims’ day-to-day activities”. The alleged perpetrator must have known that their behaviour would have a serious effect on the victim, or the behaviour must have been such that he or she “ought to have known” it would have that effect.
This offence is included in the Home Office Counting Rules, under the category of “Assault without injury”.
This is an improved record-level data collection system designed to streamline the process by which forces submit data. Migration of forces to the Data Hub is ongoing.
For example, when the police initially record an offence as a homicide it remains classified as such unless the police or courts decide that a lesser offence, or no offence, took place. The offence would be reclassified on the Homicide Index as “no longer recorded” but remain in the main police recorded crime collection as a homicide.
The Homicide Index is continually updated with revised information from the police as investigations continue and as cases are heard by the courts. The version used for analysis does not accept updates after it is “frozen” to ensure the data do not change during the analysis period. See Section 3.1 of the User guide to crime statistics for more information.
There are strict guidelines to which the police must adhere to in order to transfer or cancel a crime report (please refer to the Home Office Counting Rules for further information).
Voluntary attendances act as an alternative to arrest where the suspect attends a police station voluntarily to assist with investigation. Not all forces are able to provide data on the number of arrests, bails and voluntary attendances for domestic abuse-related crimes. 
During the investigation, some victims (for a wide variety of reasons) may decide not to support the police in their enquiries. Although this often means that it is more difficult for any further action to be taken by the police, the case will continue to be progressed if possible. 
Evidence-led prosecutions are an option considered by the police and may be taken up by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). This means that, even in cases where a victim is unwilling to appear in court as a witness, it does not necessarily prevent the suspect being subject to a trial.
In cases where the victim does not support a police investigation or prosecution, the offence remains recorded. In such cases, the police may suggest ways the victim can seek support through the criminal justice process, or from specialist support agencies or organisations. Where the victim still does not support the investigation or prosecution, the police and the CPS will review all the evidence in the case to determine if the case can continue without the evidence of the victim. Where the Code for Crown Prosecutors is still satisfied, the crime will proceed to court. If there is insufficient evidence, or if it is not in the public interest to prosecute, the case cannot continue regardless of how serious it is.
To support a victim through the trial process, the CPS can ask the court to allow a victim or a witness in the case to use a variety of “special measures”. These can include giving evidence behind screens or from another room or location using a video link. Where the case is reliant on the evidence of the victim, the CPS may ask the court to compel the witness to attend court by issuing a witness summons. However, this will only occur after the police have carried out a full risk assessment and detailed enquiries have been made with any specialist support agencies who are providing assistance to the victim.
The police can request advice from the CPS on domestic abuse cases before referring them to the CPS for charging1. The police may make a request for informal advice without submitting a file, which can take place in person or over the telephone. Informal advice is sought if the matter is straightforward and does not require the formal submission of papers. Such advice would be generic, on general points of law and not case specific. An appropriate audit trail is required for any case-specific enquiries and advice that the police may take in investigating a case.
The CPS is the principal prosecuting authority for England and Wales, acting independently in criminal cases investigated by the police and others. The CPS can only consider cases that are referred to them by the police or other investigators. Specifically, with regard to domestic abuse, the CPS:
The Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the principles to be followed by Crown Prosecutors when they make case decisions. The CPS does not determine guilt; this is a matter for the court to decide on the facts of a case as presented. The CPS aims to build the strongest possible cases on the available evidence to assist the jury in this task.
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant impacts on the CPS and the entire criminal justice system. The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in reduced court activity, causing a rise in live caseload per Prosecutor and a backlog of cases awaiting time in court. Caution should be exercised in making comparisons with previous years.
This has had a significant impact on the CPS and the entire criminal justice system, particularly on the number of prosecutions being finalised. 
Please see the Crown Prosecution Service annual report 2020 to 2021 for more information.
Police referrals to the CPS for a decision to charge a suspect are sometimes referred to as pre-charge receipts, and are the most frequent interaction between the police and the CPS. In some circumstances, a case referred to the CPS may require further evidence to be obtained before a charge decision can be made. If this is the case, the Prosecutor will advise the officer of the further material required to obtain a charging decision by way of a targeted and specific action plan.
Where the police believe that a domestic abuse case could proceed to charge, the decision to charge is made by the CPS and not the police. 
CPS data are available through its Case Management System (CMS) and associated Management Information System (MIS)2. The CPS collects data to assist in the effective management of its prosecution functions and therefore does not collect data that constitute official statistics as defined in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007.
CPS domestic abuse data are dependent upon lawyers and administrative staff correctly identifying applicable cases and flagging the case on the CMS. These data are accurate only to the extent that flags have been correctly applied.
For CPS data, a domestic abuse flag may be applied at the beginning of a case, or later in the prosecution process if a domestic abuse relationship becomes apparent. There is a time lag between every stage of the criminal justice process – from police referral to the CPS for charging, prosecution, conviction and sentencing. For example, a domestic abuse case could be referred to the CPS in one year, but a conviction may not be secured until a later year. As a result, the data presented in this release on referrals, prosecutions and convictions do not necessarily follow on from each other and caution should be taken when making comparisons3.
CPS data include both child and adult defendant and victim data. This does not strictly align with the government definition of domestic abuse, which only applies to those cases where both the victim and perpetrator are aged 16 years and over. CPS data also cover stalking and harassment offences flagged as domestic abuse-related, and controlling or coercive behaviour offences. The data also include offences involving the “disclosure of private sexual photographs and films with the intent to cause distress or anxiety”, commonly referred to as “revenge porn”. This was made a specific criminal offence in April 20154. 
CPS pre-charge data covers those cases, by suspect, referred to the CPS by the police for a charging decision. The CMS data report the average number of calendar days since the first decision was sought by the police, to the date in which the last decision made was to charge. The data include those cases where the police were required to submit further evidence prior to a decision to charge being made. The data also include more serious complex cases including those involving a death, rape and serious sexual offences, child abuse, large-scale or long-term fraud, and cases with substantial or complex video or audio key evidence. These must all be referred to CPS area-based prosecutors.
It is not possible within the system to separately record the timeliness of cases subject to advice and further work before a charge decision was made and recorded as the last decision.
The data include all cases where the decision was made on the same day by CPS Direct, and cases that must be referred to CPS area-based prosecutors by way of face-to-face, telephone, or written advice and consultation with the police.
There can be a delay between the commencement of new offences and cases coming through to court. This is primarily as a result of the time it takes for an offence to be investigated, the police to assign an outcome, the prosecution, and to result in a completed court case.
The Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the conditions that must be met for a prosecution to take place5. There are two stages to this: the evidential stage and the public interest stage.
The evidential stage requires that the CPS must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each defendant on each charge. This finding is based on the Prosecutor’s objective assessment of the evidence. It must also be in the public interest to prosecute the offence and the offender. It means that an objective, impartial and reasonable jury, bench of magistrates or judge hearing a case alone, properly directed and acting in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged. This is a different test from that applied by the criminal courts where a court may only convict if it is sure that the defendant is guilty.
In circumstances where a victim is not willing to support a prosecution, when considering public interest, prosecutors will give careful consideration to a number of factors. These can include the seriousness of the offence, the interests and safety of the victim, other family members and any children or other dependants, the culpability and maturity of the defendant, and any other factors that may present as relevant to public interest.
In every case where there is sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution, prosecutors must go on to consider whether a prosecution is required in the public interest. A prosecution will usually take place unless the Prosecutor is satisfied that there are public interest factors tending against prosecution, which outweigh those tending in favour. In the case of domestic abuse, it will be rare for the public interest stage not to be met.
Criminal justice outcomes data on controlling or coercive behaviour offences are available from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).
Criminal court data are primarily published on a principal offences basis, meaning that where proceedings involve more than one offence, the principal offence is reported. The MoJ publishes experimental data that show the combination of offences for which defendants were prosecuted.
MoJ data refer to a different time period to prosecutions data published by the CPS, and relate to the disposals for offenders of controlling or coercive behaviour, rather than offences heard at a magistrates’ court6. As a result, data from the CPS and MoJ are not directly comparable.
As with CPS data, there can be a delay between the commencement of new offences and cases coming through to court, primarily as a result of the time it takes for an offence to be investigated, the police to assign an outcome, the prosecution, and to result in a completed court case. 
For more information, see CPS Relations with the Police.
The CPS collects data to assist in the effective management of its prosecution functions and therefore does not collect data that constitute official statistics as defined in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007.
Note the percentage of cases charged covers those domestic abuse cases, by suspect, forwarded to CPS during a given year for charging decisions and are not directly comparable in numbers with those prosecuted, which covers cases, by defendant, finalised during the same year. One defendant may have committed a number of offences, usually, although not exclusively, against one victim.
These offences are included within the offence category of “harassment” under the Home Office Counting Rules.
Additional information and support for prosecutors to enable them to make decisions in cases involving domestic abuse can be found in Domestic Abuse Guidelines for Prosecutors.
A defendant who appears before both magistrates’ court and Crown Court may not do so within the same year, meaning for a given year convictions may exceed prosecutions or sentences may not equal convictions. Defendants who appear before both courts may be convicted at the Crown Court for a different offence to that for which they were originally proceeded against at magistrates’ court.
Once a prosecution has taken place, there are two main outcomes: the defendant is not convicted, or the defendant is convicted.
The CPS reviews every case they receive from the police. Review is a continuous process and prosecutors must take account of any change in circumstances that occurs as the case develops, including what becomes known of the defence case.
Where circumstances have changed, sometimes there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction, or it may no longer be in the public interest to prosecute. In those circumstances a case may be discontinued, that is, stopped from proceeding further. 
If the defendant pleads guilty or is found guilty by a jury, they will be sentenced by the judge or by the magistrates.
Regardless of whether the defendant is convicted or not, the court can make a restraining order in appropriate cases. 
Data on prosecutions, convictions, and other outcomes of charging decisions are provided by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). These data include reasons for non-convictions. Prosecutions data cover domestic abuse-related cases, by defendant, finalised during a specified year1.
Data showing the sex of defendants are held in the CPS Management Information System, however, the records are not always complete. The sex of the defendant is unknown in some cases and may not be recorded in others. 
The Ministry of Justice are responsible for publishing data from the family courts (with data collected by Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service through the FamilyMan database) which include orders to prevent domestic violence.
Two types of domestic violence remedy order can be granted by the family courts:
a non-molestation order, which can either prohibit particular behaviour or general molestation by someone who has previously been violent towards the applicant and/or any relevant children
an occupation order, which can define or regulate rights of occupation of the home by the parties involved
Breaches of non-molestation orders made by the family courts are classified as a criminal offence. It is not possible to compare across applications and orders, because they do not refer to the same cohort of cases.
The domestic violence disclosure scheme (DVDS, commonly known as Clare’s Law2) was brought into effect in March 2014. The scheme has two routes:
“right to ask”: this enables someone to ask the police about a partner’s previous history of domestic violence or violent acts
“right to know”: the police can proactively disclose information in prescribed circumstances
Every request under the DVDS is thoroughly checked by a panel made up of police, probation services and other agencies to ensure information is only passed on where it is deemed lawful, proportionate and necessary.
Individual processes in place across forces for considering and approving applications may vary. Trained police officers and advisers are then on hand to support victims through the difficult and sometimes dangerous transitional period.
DVPOs and DVPNs were introduced across all 43 police forces in England and Wales on 8 March 2014. A DVPO is a civil order that provides protection to victims by enabling the police and magistrates’ courts to put in place protective measures in the immediate aftermath of a domestic violence incident. A DVPO is often used where there is insufficient evidence to charge a perpetrator and provide protection to a victim via bail conditions.
A DVPN is the initial notice issued by the police to provide emergency protection to an individual believed to be the victim of domestic violence. This notice, which must be authorised by a police superintendent, contains prohibitions that effectively prevent the suspected perpetrator from returning to the victim’s home or otherwise contacting the victim. A DVPN may be issued to a person aged 18 years and over if the police superintendent has reasonable grounds for believing that:
A DVPO can prevent the perpetrator from returning to a residence and from having contact with the victim for up to 28 days. An application for a DVPO by the police to a magistrates’ court should be completed within 48 hours of the DVPN being served on the perpetrator. 
Data are included in the release on the number of DVPOs and DVPNs which are applied for, and the number which are granted3. DVPOs are granted by a magistrate, whereas DVPNs can be approved by a police superintendent; this may explain any disparity seen between the approval of DVPNs and DVPOs.
A defendant who appears before both magistrates’ court and Crown Court may not do so within the same year, meaning for a given year convictions may exceed prosecutions or sentences may not equal convictions. Defendants who appear before both courts may be convicted at the Crown Court for a different offence to that for which they were originally proceeded against at magistrates’ court.
This initiative was named after Clare Wood who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009, who unbeknown to her had a record of violence against women.
Not all forces are able to provide data on the number of DVPOs and DVPNs which are applied for, and the number which are granted.
It is important to note that the data collected and reported throughout the release are not directly comparable between stages. This is because they are collected on different bases (for example, victims, crimes, suspects or defendants) and may not cover the same cohort because of variation in the time taken for cases to progress through the system. 
Statistics on domestic abuse are produced separately by a number of different organisations in England and Wales. When taken in isolation, these statistics may not provide the context required by users to enable them to understand the national and local picture of domestic abuse.
Although these datasets are not directly comparable, bringing the data together in the Domestic abuse and the criminal justice system publication allows us to provide a picture of the level of attrition through the criminal justice system. 
Data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) should not be viewed in isolation. The estimates from the survey show a higher level of domestic abuse, in terms of the number of victims, than other data sources. They also show that many victims will not report the abuse they have experienced to the police. Therefore, while the CSEW provides the best available estimate of trends in the prevalence of domestic abuse, they may not match trends in administrative data sources. The CSEW cannot be used to make any inferences about demands on the police, the criminal justice system’s response to perpetrators, or service provision.
Many incidents of domestic abuse do not come to the attention of the police, which is why the estimated number of victims can be higher than the number of police recorded incidents and crimes. Of those incidents that are recorded, many will fall short of notifiable offences and are therefore not recorded as crimes. 
Changes seen in police recorded crime data can be affected by a range of different practices, including police forces improving their identification and recording of domestic abuse incidents as crimes, and an increased willingness by victims to come forward and report these crimes. As such, data held by the police can only provide a partial picture of the actual level of domestic abuse experienced. 
It is necessary to look at the data presented in this release in its entirety since each individual stage of the system is, in part, influenced by activity at a prior stage. In particular, improving the police’s ability to investigate, solve, and support the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in prosecuting domestic abuse cases is dependent upon understanding and improving many elements of domestic abuse investigations. 
Furthermore, cases may drop out at any stage of the process. The different datasets included in this release do not relate to the same cases given the different timescales and reference periods used to collect the data. Data can be based on offences, victims, suspects or defendants and can also vary in the way that cases are identified. 
These factors, together with the time lag between the stages in the criminal justice process, mean that data discussed at each stage of the criminal justice process do not refer to the same cohort of cases and so direct comparisons cannot be made across sources1. Throughout the release, caveats are provided to make it clear where a comparison can be made and where it may be more difficult or not possible to directly compare data sources.
The taking or keeping of a person in custody by legal authority, especially in response to a criminal charge.
Pre-charge bail is the temporary release of a person while further investigations are conducted or more evidence is sought. Post-charge bail is the temporary release of an accused person while awaiting trial.
Cases where the Crown Prosecution Service’s decision was to charge.
Domestic abuse police incidents and domestic abuse-related crimes combined, providing the total demand on police. This is used to calculate a combined incident and crime rate for domestic abuse and the proportion of domestic abuse incidents that were recorded as crimes.
Controlling behaviour is a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their resources and capacities for personal gain, depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance and escape, and regulating their everyday behaviour. Coercive behaviour is a continuing act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish or frighten their victim.
Cases where the defendant was convicted following a prosecution, comprising: 
Incidents of domestic abuse that resulted in a crime being recorded by the police and are included in police recorded crime. These can also be referred to as domestic abuse-related offences. Domestic abuse-related crimes can be added to domestic abuse incidents to create a total picture of the demand that domestic abuse puts on the police.
Incidents of domestic abuse that were reported to the police, but following investigation, do not amount to a crime or offence according to the National Crime Recording Standards. These can be added to domestic abuse-related crimes to create a total picture of the demand that domestic abuse puts on the police.
Any homicide where the relationship between the victim (aged 16 years or over) and the perpetrator falls into one of the following categories: 
These schemes give members of the public a formal mechanism to make enquiries about an individual who they are in a relationship with, or who is in a relationship with someone they know, where there is a concern that the individual may be violent towards their partner. The scheme has two routes: 
The initial notice issued by the police to provide emergency protection to an individual believed to be the victim of domestic violence. This notice, which must be authorised by a police superintendent, contains prohibitions that effectively prevent the suspected perpetrator from returning to the victim’s home or otherwise contacting the victim.
This response can prevent the perpetrator from returning to a residence and from having contact with the victim for up to 28 days. 
An IDVA is a professionally qualified, specialist domestic abuse worker, who supports high-risk victims of domestic abuse. High-risk cases are determined using the Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour-Based Violence (DASH) Risk Identification Checklist, professional judgement and where repeat incidents are occurring. 
A MARAC is a meeting where information is shared on the highest-risk domestic abuse cases between representatives of local police, health, child protection, housing practitioners, independent domestic violence advisors, probation and other specialists from the statutory and voluntary sectors. 
Cases where the Crown Prosecution Service’s decision was not to prosecute, for evidential or public interest reasons.
The outcomes of all completed prosecutions where the defendant was not convicted, comprising the following: 
Cases where the outcome of the charging decision has not been recorded or is undefined. 
Cases where a caution, conditional caution, reprimand or final warning has been given or where the offence has been taken into consideration in relation to other charges. 
These data are based on the full outcomes framework introduced in April 2014. This new outcomes framework allows every crime recorded by the police to be given a detailed outcome, showing how the police deal with crimes (including crimes that are still under investigation).
Cases where the defendant has been charged may be administratively finalised at the prosecution stage. Post-charge administrative finalisation may occur when prosecution cannot proceed because a defendant has failed to appear at court and a Bench Warrant has been issued for his or her arrest, or the defendant has died, or is found unfit to plead, or where proceedings are adjourned indefinitely. If the police trace a missing defendant then proceedings can continue.
Decisions recorded as Pending response – further investigation (formally known as Administrative finalisations) are finalised in the CPS Case Management System for administrative reasons following any further requests of the investigating authority. These are not legal decisions and may not be the end of the case. Reasons for pre-charge pending response – further investigation finalisation include: 
the CPS have asked the police to provide further information where there is insufficient evidence to make a charging decision, or the police are requesting early investigative advice. If the police do not respond within three months, following reminders, the case is closed on the Case Management System (CMS)
the CPS have advised the police to charge but the suspect has not been charged because the suspect has not answered police bail or cannot be located 
cases where a file submission has been rejected at triage because items are missing, and the police have been asked to supply the additional material and have not responded to reminders 
where the case has been returned to the police, with or without a lawyer’s advice and/or actions, and the police decide to take no further action on the allegation 
the suspect has died 
Pending response – further investigation decisions are not legal decisions and may not be the end of the case. In some cases, for example, where the suspect is located or new information is provided the cases can be reopened and, if possible, a charging decision can be made.
Of all the suspects referred by the police, pre-charge decisions are those where the CPS has completed making a decision on whether to charge, take no further action, recommend an out of court decision, record and outcome of pending response – further investigation or “other”.
The number of suspects referred by the police to the CPS for a charging decision.
The percentage of people aged 16 to 74 years who reported they had experienced any form of domestic abuse in the last year in the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). This prevalence rate is used to produce estimates of the number of victims of domestic abuse, as reported in the CSEW. 
All cases where the defendant(s) were charged, summonsed in court, or charged by way of a postal requisition during the period. This includes those proceeding to a trial or guilty plea, those discontinued and those which could not proceed.
All cases resulting in an outcome other than a conviction are allocated a reason explaining why the case failed. If more than one reason applies, the principal reason is selected. Reasons for non-conviction comprise the following:

In the week beginning 1 November 2021, the percentage of adults testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies remained high across all age groups and increased in those aged 70 years and over across the UK. This is likely as a result of the vaccination booster programme. 
An estimated 92.8% of the adult population of England, 91.4% in Wales, 93.3% in 
Northern Ireland and 92.5% in Scotland,  would have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in the week beginning 1 November 2021.    
The presence of antibodies suggests a person previously had COVID-19 or has been vaccinated.    
The survey does not include people in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments.

144,"COVID-19 mortality rate in England falls for first time since May
The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) for deaths due to coronavirus (COVID-19) in England fell significantly in October 2021; the first decrease since May 2021. 
In October 2021, there were 43,435 deaths registered in England, which is 2,883 deaths (7.1%) above the five-year average (between 2015 and 2019) for this month. 
There were 2,993 deaths registered in Wales, which is 2590 deaths (9.5%) more than the October five-year average. 
COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in England (accounting for 5.6% of all deaths registered), and Wales (9.5% of all deaths). 
The ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 decreased significantly to 50.8 deaths per 100,000 people in October 2021 (compared with 64.4 in September 2021), after adjusting for the size and age of the population. 
In Wales, the ASMR increased to 97.6 deaths per 100,000 people in October 2021 (compared with 89.6 in September 2021), but this increase was not statistically significant.

145,"Infections continue to fall in England and Wales
Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections continued to decrease in England and Wales in the week ending 13 November 2021. An estimated 824,900 people would have tested positive in England, and around 55,800 people in Wales. 
The percentage of people testing positive remained level in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. 
The estimated percentage of people living in private households (not in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments) that had COVID-19 in the most recent week was: 
 - 1.51% in England (1 in 65 people), compared with 1.70% (1 in 60 people) the week before

146,"Most adults reported wearing a face covering
Most adults (85%) in Great Britain (GB) reported they wore a face covering when outside their home over the past seven days. This proportion appeared to increase with age; 71% of those aged 16 to 29 years reported wearing a face covering compared to 96% of those aged 70 years and above.
While most adults (70%) reported wearing a face covering while travelling on public transport, just 24% said that everyone or almost everyone else was doing the same.
Around 1 in 20 (6%) of adults had been asked to show proof of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test in the past seven days (excluding for travel abroad). The most common reason was to attend a theatre or comedy performance (20%), a nightclub or bar (18%) or a sporting event (17%).
Around 6 in 10 (62%) of adults reported their cost of living has increased over the last month. An increase in the price of food was the most common reason, cited by 86% of those whose living costs had gone up. An increase in gas or electricity bills (78%) and an increase in the price of fuel (76%) were also commonly cited. 
It should be noted that there are strong seasonal spending patterns relating to gas and electricity that may affect these results. Consumer price statistics for October show that electricity and gas prices increased by 8.7% and 17.1% respectively on the month, resulting in 12-month inflation rates of 18.8% for electricity and 28.1% for gas.

147,"UK excess mortality in 2021 peaked in January, but has steadily increased since the Spring
Almost all European countries (including the UK) had lower peak excess mortality in the first half of 2021 compared with 2020, except for Portugal, Estonia, and Hungary. 
Excess mortality in the UK in 2021 peaked in January, before dropping to negative values (lower mortality compared to the five-year average) for all UK countries by the week ending 5 March 2021. 
Since then, excess mortality has steadily increased for all UK countries, and by the week ending 3 September 2021 ranged from -4.3% for England to 20.8% for Northern Ireland. 
The chart shows provisional relative age-standardised mortality rates (rASMRs) for the UK, constituent countries of the UK and 11 European countries with the highest peak in excess mortality (rASMRs) in the first half of 2021. 

For the UK countries, non-residents are excluded for figures from England, Scotland and Wales but are included for Northern Ireland. However, the numbers of non-residents included are very small.
Information about whether non-residents are included for countries outside the UK is not provided by Eurostat.
UK data are based on date of registration rather than date of death. Most other European countries are based on date of death.
Relative age-standardised mortality rates (rASMRs) are expressed as the percentage change per week in 2020 or 2021 from the average expected age-standardised mortality rate in 2015 to 2019

Compared to 2020, throughout much of 2021, relative excess mortality in the UK, Czechia and Hungary was higher for younger (0 to 64 years) than for older (65 years and over). 
During the pandemic, spikes in excess mortality have been generally characterised by higher peaks for all ages than for age 0 to 64 years. This is because COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in older age groups. However, this trend has become less clear for some countries in the first half of 2021, most noticeably for the UK nations, Czechia and Hungary. 
Compared to all ages, those aged up to 64 in these countries saw worse mortality rates relative to the average in some or all weeks. This suggests that COVID-19 disproportionately impacted mortality rates for younger compared to older age groups in these countries in the first half of 2021. 
Most Nordic countries have had relatively low peak excess mortality in both 2020 and in the first half of 2021, compared to most other countries. 
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/datauptoweekending3september2021,"The UK has seen a gradual but sustained increase in relative excess mortality since spring 2021, after an initial drop from the very high excess mortality in winter 2020 to 21.
For much of the first half of 2021, relative excess mortality in the UK was higher for younger people (aged 0 to 64 years) than for older people; this differed from most countries except Slovakia, Hungary and Czechia. 
In 2021 countries in central Europe such as Poland, Bulgaria and Czechia increasingly overtook western Europe (including the UK) to have the highest relative cumulative excess mortality since the start of the pandemic by mid-2021, while the UK was similar to Spain and Portugal.
The Nordic countries, with the exception of Sweden, have consistently had lower than average levels of cumulative excess mortality since the start of 2020, despite the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

150,"Booster jab recipients less likely to test positive for COVID-19
People who have received a COVID-19 booster jab were “less likely” to test positive for the virus than those who received their second dose of Astra Zeneca or Pfizer more than 90 days ago, in the fortnight ending 6 November 2021.
During the same time period, those who had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine also continued to be “less likely” to test positive for COVID-19 than those who were unvaccinated.
The data also revealed that adults living with someone aged 16 or under were more likely to test positive, and people aged under 70 who lived with someone age 70 or older were less likely to test positive, compared to those not living with people of these age groups.
People who live in a household where someone had contact with a hospital or care home were less likely to test positive, in comparison to households where no-one had contact. Meanwhile, people who spend more time socialising outside the home were more likely to test positive for COVID-19.

An odds ratio indicates the likelihood of an individual testing positive for COVID-19 given a particular characteristic/variable.

The core demographic variables (as explained in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of populations in the UK by risk of testing positive for COVID-19, September 2021) are included to adjust for these factors.

People working in the education industry sector continued to be more likely to test positive in comparison to those working in other sectors in the fortnight ending 6 November 2021; the higher risk is likely related to the recent high infection levels among school aged children.
Those who spent more time socialising outside the home were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 in the fortnight ending 6 November 2021.

152,"Previously infected people less likely to be vaccinated
People were less likely to be vaccinated against coronavirus (COVID-19) if they had had a previous infection of the virus (more than 120 days ago). 
A study of COVID-19 Infection Survey data examined the likelihood people were vaccinated, based on data from 3 to 30 October 2021, including age, sex, employment, ethnicity, and other factors. 
It found people aged 18 to 64 years who worked in hospitality, personal services and transport sectors were less likely to have received a vaccination against COVID-19 than those working in other sectors. 
For those aged between 18 and 64 years, ethnic minorities (excluding White minorities) were less likely to be vaccinated than those reporting White ethnicity. 
There were also differences in the likelihood of vaccine uptake by sex and age. Younger men in the 18- to 34- year age group were less likely to be vaccinated than younger women, however older men in this age group were more likely to be vaccinated than women. 
People aged 18 to 64 years who reported they were working were more likely to be vaccinated than those not working or employed but not currently working. 
Across all age groups, those who live in more deprived areas were less likely to have received a vaccination against COVID-19, than those who lived in less deprived areas.

People of all ages were less likely to be vaccinated against coronavirus (COVID-19) if they had been infected with COVID-19 previously (more than 120 days ago).
For those aged between 18 and 64 years, ethnic minorities (excluding White minorities) were less likely to be vaccinated than those reporting White ethnicity.
Younger men in the 18- to 34-year age group were less likely to be vaccinated than younger women, however older men in this age group were more likely to be vaccinated than women.
Those aged between 18 and 64 years were less likely to have received a vaccination against COVID-19 if they reported they were not working or were employed but not currently working, compared with those who were working. 
The likelihood of being vaccinated varied by work sector; people aged 18 to 64 years who worked in hospitality, personal services and transport sectors were less likely to have received a vaccination against COVID-19 than those working in other sectors. 
Across all age groups, those who lived in more deprived areas were less likely to have received a vaccination against COVID-19, than those who lived in less deprived areas. 
This technical article presents the methods and results of analysis to identify characteristics related to vaccination uptake. We have used data from the period from 3 to 30 October 2021 in the analysis. The article uses a statistical model to examine which different characteristics of people sampled in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) are associated with those who report having received a vaccine against COVID-19 and those who have not reported having received a vaccine.
Vaccination rates differed considerably by age (Figure 1). For ease of analysis, we grouped ages into three standard age groups: 18- to 34-year-olds, 35- to 64-year-olds and those aged 65 years and over. The difference in vaccination rates by age was largely because vaccines were available to these populations at different times. Vaccine rollout varied between the countries of the UK, but in England, all 65-year-olds were eligible for vaccines based on age alone by 15 February 2021. Those over 35 years of age were eligible by 20 May 2021, and those over 18 years of age by 18 June 2021. Because of the time differences in vaccines being available to the different age groups, there may also be differences in the reasons why people have not been vaccinated, for example, preferences regarding vaccination or lack of access or eligibility.
The analysis used reported vaccination status from participants from the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS). CIS is a large household survey monitoring current COVID-19 infections within private households in the UK. It excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. Participants were asked about demographics, living environment, behaviours, work, and vaccination uptake. Further information on the study design can be found in COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.
Daily official government figures provide the recorded actual numbers of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 issued. Our vaccination estimates are likely to be different from the official figures, because they are estimates based on a sample survey of reported vaccine status. In addition, our sampling method for Northern Ireland is different to the other nations, inviting only people who have previously participated in a Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) survey, which could result in a sample of individuals who are more likely to get vaccinated. 
Differences between official figures and the estimates from this survey may also differ in scale across each of the four UK nations (some survey estimates are closer to the official reported figures than others) because of differences in reporting dates and the inclusion of National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) data for England. We use NIMS data to check our survey data, where participants do not report having received a vaccine in the survey, but are recorded to have done so in the administrative data. Adding this information improves the quality of the data we have for England. NIMS does not cover Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, so we use self-reported vaccination status alone in these countries. This means that vaccination estimates are likely to be lower for these countries because we rely on self-report alone. To make sure that comparisons of other characteristics are not affected by this, we control for region and country in all models. 
In this analysis two logistic regression models were run for each of the three age groups: 18- to 34-year-olds, 35- to 64-year-olds and those aged 65 years and over. Our outcome was “Vaccinated” – defined as a participant having had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine prior to their visit. We also treated someone as vaccinated if they have been recorded to have received a vaccination in the 21 days following their visit. We included data from the most recent visit per participant in the 28-day period from 3 to 30 October 2021. The models included all participants across the UK. 
Because characteristics of people are sometimes related, we wanted to estimate the impact of each variable. For example, old people and young people tend to have different health statuses, so when we estimated the impact of health status on vaccination, we needed to control for the impact of age. 
Our first model, Model 1 (the core model), estimated the likelihood of an individual being vaccinated for eight core demographic characteristics:
Model 1 estimated the total effect of these core demographic characteristics on the likelihood of being vaccinated and included all participants. The model gives the overall effect of these factors and does not try to estimate how much of these overall effects might be explained by other factors such as health status. 
The model also tested for interactions between the core demographic characteristics, including interactions between those variables that were significant at a 0.001 threshold. For example, we see that the effect of sex changes by age in the 18- to 34- years age group: in this group, younger men were less likely to be vaccinated than younger women, whereas older men in the age group were more likely be vaccinated than older women. The outputs of Model 1, which included all core variables and interactions, are presented in the accompanying dataset. 
The core variables can affect the likelihood of being vaccinated directly as well as indirectly through other factors like work status, so for the second group of variables, we adjusted for these core demographic variables. Model 2 tested whether other factors that may change over time, such as work status, affected the likelihood of being vaccinated. This means that we can say, for example, that people aged 35 to 64 years were less likely to be vaccinated if they were not working, regardless of where in the UK they lived, or whether they were a man or a woman.
Because the core demographic variables were included as controls in Model 2, when looking at results we do not draw conclusions about the core demographic characteristics from Model 1. Work status was included as an additional control in all models testing other factors associated with work.
Having tested the different variables, we only included in Model 2 characteristics that predicted whether someone reported being vaccinated independently of the other characteristics, using a technique called backward elimination with a significance threshold of 0.05. The sample was slightly smaller for Model 2 as participants with missing responses to the final variables used could not be included. The models were run for all three age groups and the final significant characteristics that were included in Model 2 were different for each age group. The outputs of Model 2 for each three age groups are presented in the accompanying dataset. 
This analysis used data from 3 to 30 October 2021 with 36,281 (93.9%) participants vaccinated out of 38,651 participants from across the UK included in the model.
Figure 2 presents findings from Model 1 for 18- to 34-year-olds.

Estimates are subject to uncertainty, given that a sample is only part of the wider population. The model provides 95% confidence intervals around the estimates.
Deprivation is based on an index of multiple deprivation (IMD) score or equivalent scoring method for the devolved administrations, from 1, which represents most deprived up to 100, which represents least deprived. The odds ratio shows how a 10 unit increase in deprivation score, which is equivalent to 10 percentiles or 1 decile, affects the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19. 
An odds ratio indicates the likelihood of an individual having received a vaccination against COVID-19 given a particular characteristic or variable. When a characteristic or variable has an odds ratio of one, this means there is neither an increase nor a decrease in the likelihood of the participant having received a vaccination against COVID-19 compared with the reference category. An odds ratio greater than one indicates an increased likelihood of the participant having received a vaccination against COVID-19 compared with the reference category. An odds ratio less than one indicates a decreased likelihood of the participant having received a vaccination against COVID-19 compared with the reference category. 
For 18- to 34-year-olds, there was statistical evidence of an interaction between age and sex. This means that younger men in this age group were less likely to be vaccinated than younger women. However, this changed with age such that older men in this age group were more likely to be vaccinated than older women.
The interaction between age and sex is plotted in Figure 3. The y axis gives predicted probabilities of having been vaccinated calculated at a reference value for other core demographic factors (White ethnicity, household size of one, non-multigenerational household, living in a major urban area, 50th deprivation percentile). The predicted probabilities should not be used as population vaccination rates. Levels of vaccination in the population may be different because of other factors not included in the model and because this model is based on a sample.

An odds ratio greater than one indicates an increased likelihood of the participant having received a vaccination against COVID-19 compared with the reference category. An odds ratio less than one indicates a decreased likelihood of the participant having received a vaccination against COVID-19 compared with the reference category. 
Work sectors are included as binary variables, so the reference group for each category is the opposite of that category, for example the reference group for working in government is not working in government.
This analysis used data from 3 to 30 October 2021 with 156,005 (98.1%) participants vaccinated out of 159,079 participants from across the UK included in the model.

This analysis used data from 3 to 30 October 2021 with 104,517 (99.5%) participants vaccinated out of 105,060 participants from across the UK included in the model.
Figure 7 presents findings from Model 1 for those aged 65 years and over. Key findings presented in Figure 7 are:
There are fewer statistically significant findings in the older age group because there are far fewer people who have not been vaccinated compared with other age groups (see Figure 1). As a result, the model has less power to detect effects, and the findings that it does produce have greater uncertainty, as indicated by wider confidence intervals in Figure 7. 
Results for other characteristics included in the model and results for earlier time periods can be found in the accompanying dataset.

A confidence interval gives an indication of the degree of uncertainty of an estimate, showing the precision of a sample estimate. The 95% confidence intervals are calculated so that if we repeated the study many times, 95% of the time the true unknown value would lie between the lower and upper confidence limits. A wider interval indicates more uncertainty in the estimate. Overlapping confidence intervals indicate that there may not be a true difference between two estimates.
For more information, see our methodology page on statistical uncertainty.
A coefficient indicates the likelihood of an individual testing positive for COVID-19 given a particular characteristic or variable. When a characteristic or variable has a coefficient of zero, this means there is neither an increase nor a decrease in the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 compared with the reference category. A coefficient greater than zero indicates an increased likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 compared with the reference category. A coefficient less than zero indicates a decreased likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 compared with the reference category.

153,"Infections decrease in England and Wales
Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections decreased in England in the week ending 6 November 2021, having increased throughout most of October. 
The percentage of people testing positive also decreased in Wales, while infections remained level in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. 
The estimated percentage of people living in private households (not in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments) that had COVID-19 in the most recent week was:
 - 1.70% in England (1 in 60 people), compared with 2.02% (1 in 50 people) the week before
 - 2.13% in Wales (1 in 45 people), compared with 2.39% (1 in 40 people) the week before

154,"Over 250,000 deaths in private homes since January 2020
Just over a quarter of a million deaths in private homes were registered between January 2020 and June 2021. The figure for this 18-month period was almost 63,000 deaths above the five-year average (2015 to 2019).
The number of deaths in private homes has generally been increasing since 2005 but the 29.2% increase in 2020 was considerably larger than any other recent yearly change. 
Deaths in private homes have remained high with almost 86,000 between January 2021 and June 2021. There were just over 84,000 deaths during the same period last year.
Private homes are the only place of occurrence where deaths have been consistently above the five-year average in all months from January 2020 to June 2021.

155,"9 in 10 students have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose
The majority (91%) of students in England say they have received at least one coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine dose. 
According to the Student COVID-19 Insights Survey (SCIS), a significantly higher proportion of students had been fully vaccinated by late October (85%) than late September (78%). 
Those who had received at least one vaccine dose were significantly more likely to request a test if they developed symptoms (95%) than unvaccinated students (73%). 
Of the minority of students who were unvaccinated (8%), around half (51%) said they were unlikely to take a vaccine if offered, while a third (32%) said they would be likely to take a vaccine if offered. 
Around half of students had taken a COVID-19 test in the previous seven days (49%).

An estimated 93.1% of the adult population of England, 91.7% in Wales, 90.9% in Northern Ireland and 92.5% in Scotland would have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in the week beginning 18 October 2021.    
The presence of antibodies suggests a person previously had COVID-19 or has been vaccinated.    
Antibody positivity for those aged 16 to 24 years increased steadily across the UK, with estimates ranging between 96.0% and 97.4%. 
In England, Wales and Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive for antibodies increased in most age groups. In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive for antibodies increased in younger age groups and showed signs of a slow decline in older age groups. 
Our analysis defines antibody positivity by a fixed amount of antibodies in the blood. Most older people who are vaccinated will retain higher antibody levels than prior to vaccination but may have a lower number of antibodies in the blood at the time of testing. Please read our Antibodies and Immunity blog  for more information. 
The survey does not include people who live in care homes.

157,"Over 4 in 10 previously hesitant adults now vaccinated
A follow-up survey of adults in England who previously reported being hesitant about the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine has shown over 4 in 10 (44%) have now been vaccinated.
According to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, overall vaccine-hesitancy declined from 10% to 3% of all adults between 13 January and 8 August 2021.
While previous analysis showed vaccine-hesitancy was higher among young adults, vaccine uptake was higher among this group when revisited by the Vaccine Opinions Survey. 
Among previously vaccine-hesitant adults, 46% of those aged 18 to 29 years have now been vaccinated, compared with 19% of those aged 70 years and above.
While vaccine-hesitancy was previously higher among Black and Black British adults compared with White adults, the follow-up survey showed similar vaccine uptake between these two groups (47% and 42% respectively).
Adults who previously self-reported vaccine-hesitancy are those who declined a vaccine (25%) or were unlikely (33%) or unsure (42%) about having a vaccine if offered. 
Among these groups, subsequent vaccine uptake was highest among those who were unsure (60%) and lowest among those who initially declined (21%). 
Percentages in the chart above may not sum to 100% as they exclude those who said “Don’t know” or “Prefer not to say”, and those waiting for an appointment.
Looking at all previously vaccine-hesitant adults, 44% have now been vaccinated, while 55% remain unvaccinated. In comparison, 96% of all adults self-reported being vaccinated.
Around two-thirds (65%) of those who have been vaccinated after previously being vaccine-hesitant said their motivation had been wanting restrictions to ease and life to return to normal.
Of those who remained unvaccinated, 58% said that worry about side effects had stopped them from getting a vaccine.

159,"An estimated 1.2 million people in the UK have long COVID 
An estimated 1.2 million people in private households in the UK (or 1.9% of the population) were experiencing self-reported long COVID symptoms as of 2 October 2021. This is up from 1.1 million people at 5 September 2021, reflecting sustained increased COVID-19 infection rates in August 2021. 
Long COVID is defined as symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after the first suspected coronavirus infection that are not explained by something else. 
Of people with self-reported long COVID, the proportion who first had (or suspected they had) coronavirus less than 12 weeks previously increased to 20%, from 14% last month. Most people experiencing long COVID were first infected more than 12 weeks previously (71%), and 35% (426,000 people) first had COVID-19 at least a year previously. 
Just under two-thirds of people with self-reported long COVID (65%) said it adversely affected their ability to carry out daily activities, with 19% reporting that their ability to undertake daily activities was limited a lot. This is similar to previous months. 
These estimates relate to self-reported long COVID, as experienced by study participants who responded to a representative survey, rather than clinically diagnosed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 syndrome in the full population.

The estimates presented in this analysis relate to self-reported long COVID, as experienced by study participants who responded to a representative survey, rather than clinically diagnosed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 syndrome in the full population.
Of people with self-reported long COVID, 240,000 (20%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 less than 12 weeks previously, up from 154,000 (14%) last month; 849,000 people (71%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously, and 426,000 (35%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least one year previously.
The proportion of people with self-reported long COVID who reported that it reduced their ability to carry out daily activities remained stable compared with previous months; symptoms adversely affected the day-to-day activities of 780,000 people (65% of those with self-reported long COVID), with 233,000 (19%) reporting that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been ""limited a lot"".
Fatigue continued to be the most common symptom reported as part of individuals' experience of long COVID (55% of those with self-reported long COVID), followed by shortness of breath (39%), loss of smell (33%), and difficulty concentrating (30%).
As a proportion of the UK population, prevalence of self-reported long COVID remained greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, people living in more deprived areas, those working in health or social care, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability; compared with the previous month, prevalence of self-reported long COVID was notably higher among people aged 12 to 16 years or 17 to 24 years, with the latter now comparable to people aged 35 to 69 years.

160,"Estimates continue to show low rates of coronavirus reinfections
The estimated number of coronavirus (COVID-19) reinfections in the UK between July 2020 and October 2021 remains low overall and reinfections with a high viral load are even lower.
Analysis of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey showed that in this period, the estimated rate for all reinfections in the UK was 11.9 per 100,000 participant days at risk.
The estimated rate of reinfection for those with a higher viral load (that are more likely to cause illness) was 6.1 per 100,000 participant days at risk.
The rate per 100,000 participant days at risk allows us to understand the rate of reinfection depending on how long participants have been “at risk” of reinfection and accounts for participants having initial infection episodes and entering the “at-risk period” at different times.
Before 17 May 2021, the likelihood of an individual having symptoms of COVID-19 and a higher Ct value (lower viral load) in their second infection is lower compared with their first infection.

This was 97% fewer than Quarter 2 2019 as travel continues to be restricted because of COVID-19. People travelling to visit friends and relatives decreased by 93% to 173,000, holiday visits decreased by 99.6% to 13,000 and business trips decreased by 97% to 44,000. 
Overseas residents spent £386 million on their visits to the UK in Quarter 2 2021; this was 94% less than their spend in Quarter 2 2019. 
UK residents made 1 million visits abroad by air in Quarter 2 2021, which was 95% fewer than Quarter 2 2019. The largest number of visits was made to Europe (733,000); a fall of 96% in comparison to Quarter 2 2019. 
UK residents spent £1,122 million on visits abroad in Quarter 2 2021; this was 93% less than in Quarter 2 2019. 
The data collected from the IPS is for air travel only therefore all of the comparisons in this analysis are between air travel for 2019 and 2021. 
This is because sea and tunnel data could not be collected because of COVID-19 restrictions. However, overall sea and tunnel numbers provided by administrative data show a similar decrease as air travel. Sea and tunnel numbers constitute approximately 20% of all traffic before the pandemic.

168,"Most students' academic performance impacted by the pandemic
Over half (53%) of higher education students reported that their academic performance had been significantly or majorly impacted since the start of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Nearly half (49%) of students reported trying to keep a 2-metre distance from people outside their household always or most of the time. This has decreased from 83% reported in late May 2021, consistent with the rules on social distancing being relaxed.
When asked what they would do if they developed symptoms, 58% of students reported they would stay at home for 10 days. This is significantly lower than in late May (75%). 
A minority (7%) of students said they had not been vaccinated against COVID-19. Of those, 31% said they were very or fairly likely to take a vaccine if offered and 58% said they were fairly or very unlikely to do so.

169,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies remain high among UK adults
An estimated 92.2% of the adult population in England, 90.0% in Wales, 90.8% in Northern Ireland and 91.3% in Scotland would have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies in the week beginning 27 September 2021. 
The presence of antibodies suggests a person previously had COVID-19 or has been vaccinated. 
The percentage of adults testing positive for antibodies remained high in all age groups. Positivity has increased in younger adults and is showing signs of a slow decline in older adults. 
Antibody positivity has been declining in older age groups since late July 2021. Many people in this group received their first vaccination early in the vaccination programme. Those aged 50 years and over, at-risk adults, and health and social care workers are currently being offered booster jabs. 
Our analysis defines antibody positivity by a fixed amount of antibodies in the blood. Most older people who are vaccinated will retain higher antibody levels than prior to vaccination, but may have a lower number of antibodies in the blood at the time of testing. Please read our Antibodies and Immunity blog for more information.
The survey does not include people who live in care homes.
Antibodies data are currently unavailable for the period from 26 August 2021 to 15 September 2021 because of a temporary issue in the laboratory testing process. The antibody positivity estimates in the surveillance weeks from 16 August 2021 to 26 September 2021 are modelled using fewer data points meaning there is greater uncertainty for the estimates over this period. These results may be subject to revision when we receive the data that covers the period of unavailable antibody data.

170,"One in nine pupils tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies
More than one in nine school pupils tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in the latest period following an infection.
According to the Schools Infection Survey (SIS), between 14 June and 6 July 2021, 11.25% of primary school pupils (one in nine) and 12.95% of secondary school pupils (one in eight) in sampled local authorities had antibody levels above the detection limit.
These figures have been adjusted to account for the sensitivity (estimated at 80%) and specificity (estimated at 99%) of the antibody test.
The pupil antibody test used in this study detects antibodies in oral fluid produced following an infection (not vaccination), as a non-invasive alternative to blood tests.
An experimental estimate of the proportion of school pupils “ever testing” positive for COVID-19 over the course of the SIS (November 2020 to July 2021) has also been published in a separate technical article.

The antibody conversion rate (testing positive after having tested negative in the previous round) between rounds 4 and 6 (March to July 2021) was the lowest seen between any two consecutive testing points in SIS at 2.3 per 1,000 person-weeks for primary school pupils and 1.4 per 1,000 person weeks for secondary pupils; there was no significant difference between conversion rates of primary school pupils and secondary school pupils.

172,"Reduction in self-reported long COVID after vaccination
Receiving a vaccine has been associated with a lower likelihood of self-reported long COVID in people infected with coronavirus before vaccination.
“Self-reported” means that participants in the study identified themselves as experiencing persistent symptoms 12 weeks after first having the coronavirus (COVID-19) that were not explained by something else.
A first vaccine dose was associated with an initial 13% decrease in self-reported long COVID, though it is unclear from the data whether this was sustained over time, and a further 9% sustained decrease after receiving the second vaccination. There was no evidence of differences in trends of self-reported long COVID after vaccination between individuals who received the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, compared to Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. 
We cannot say whether vaccination directly reduced long COVID because of the observational nature of the study. However, participants were less likely to report continued long COVID symptoms after vaccination and there is evidence that this improvement was sustained after double vaccination, at least in the short-term.

However, it is unclear from the data whether the improvement in self-reported long COVID symptoms after receiving the first vaccination was sustained over time until receiving the second vaccination. 
Receiving a second COVID-19 vaccination was associated with 9% decrease in the likelihood of self-reported long COVID, relative to having received the first vaccination, and there was statistical evidence of a sustained improvement after this.
There was no statistical evidence of differences in post-vaccination trends of self-reported long COVID between participants who received an adenovirus vector (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccine and those who received an mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) vaccine.
There was also no statistical evidence of differences in trends according to socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnic group and area deprivation) or health-related factors (self-reported health status not related to COVID-19, and whether ever hospitalised with acute COVID-19).
The observational nature of the study means that we cannot say whether COVID-19 vaccination caused subsequent changes in the likelihood of self-reported long COVID; also, study follow-up after receiving the second vaccination was limited, so long-term associations between COVID-19 vaccination and self-reported long COVID remain unknown.

Fewer adults in Great Britain are practising preventative measures to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) compared with earlier in the year, although most still think they are important.
Between 6 and 17 October 2021, 39% of adults said they had always or often maintained social distancing when meeting with people outside their household.
This compares with 84% who believed it was important or very important in slowing the spread of coronavirus.
The percentage of adults always or often maintaining social distancing has fallen from 63% in mid-July, before limits on the numbers of people who could meet indoors were lifted in England. Restrictions on meeting indoors in Wales and Scotland were lifted in early August.
Around 90% of adults said they were always or often maintaining social distancing in January and February 2021, when lockdown restrictions were in place across Great Britain.

175,"Those in large households more likely to test positive
People living in a household of three or more people, and those living in a multigenerational household were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than those in smaller households in the two weeks up to 3 October 2021.
Data for the two weeks up to 3 October 2021 also revealed that those working in the manufacturing sector were also more likely to test positive in comparison to those working in other sectors. Findings from the previous fortnight of data showed people in manufacturing were less likely to test positive, therefore this recent finding needs to be interpreted with caution until more data is available.
High infection levels among school-age children during the same period are likely to be related to the increased likelihood of education sector workers testing positive for the coronavirus.
Estimates of the likelihood of some specific characteristics affecting an individual testing positive can fluctuate from one fortnight to another, meaning that findings which were significant in one period may not necessarily be significant in another period.
In the UK, people testing positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test continued to be more likely to report ""classic"" symptoms than gastrointestinal or loss of taste or smell only.

178,"Two vaccine doses give similar protection as previous infection 
Two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca provided a similar level of protection as having had a previous natural infection of coronavirus (COVID-19), while the Delta variant was dominant in the UK.
A study assessed the risk of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) by comparing people that had had one or two doses of the vaccines with unvaccinated people. It also assessed the effectiveness of vaccines against the main variant in the UK at that time. 
Vaccination reduced the risk of testing positive, both when the Alpha variant was dominant in the UK (1 December 2020 to 16 May 2021) and when the Delta variant was dominant (17 May to 14 August 2021). 
Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech reduced the risk of testing positive by 73% in the Delta period, compared with 80% in the Alpha period. 
Two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca reduced the risk of testing positive by 62% in the Delta period, compared with 76% in the Alpha period. 
Two vaccination doses were more effective than one dose at preventing symptomatic infection in both periods. 
Against the Delta variant, two vaccine doses reduced the risk of symptomatic infection by 75%, compared with a 58% reduction in risk three weeks or more after having had one vaccine dose.

181,"Mortality displacement did not offset excess deaths by mid-2021 
There is some evidence of mortality displacement during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, but not enough to offset the high number of deaths. 
Mortality displacement occurs when vulnerable people die sooner than expected. Therefore, these individuals are not dying in the following days, weeks, or months, where they would likely have died, potentially leading to a lower-than-average period of mortality. 
Some of the deaths that occurred during the pandemic, mainly seen in older age groups and in hospitals, likely would have occurred in the following weeks or months, when mortality was below average. 
However, these periods of below average mortality did not offset the high number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. 
Overall, from the week ending 3 January 2020 to 2 July 2021, there were 97,981 excess deaths in England and Wales (compared to what we would expect in a non-pandemic period). 
We are yet to see any evidence that deaths in those aged under 65 years or in private homes would have occurred over the following weeks or months, as cumulative deaths have not returned to what we would expect. 
This analysis uses relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates (rcASMR), which express the percentage change in excess mortality up to a given date compared to the expected mortality rate in the same period, based on the 2015 to 2019 average.

People in older age groups showed mortality displacement and had their peak excess deaths earlier in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic than people in younger age groups; those aged under 65 years had not peaked in excess deaths by 2 July 2021, as we are yet to see a substantial decrease in this age group. 
Deaths in hospitals had shown two waves in excess mortality, with percentage of excess deaths going above and then below the average each time; in contrast deaths in care homes had shown some mortality displacement, but not enough to offset above average deaths during the pandemic, and excess deaths in private homes were 25.4% above average by 2 July 2021.

The proportion of adults who reported self-isolating in the past seven days remained stable (3% in both this period and the previous period); the main reasons adults self-isolated were that they had been in contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19 (34%), they had COVID-19 symptoms (31%), or because they had tested positive for COVID-19 (24%).
Personal well-being measures of life satisfaction (7.1 in this period, 7.0 in the previous period), feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile (7.4 in this period, 7.3 in the previous period), happiness (7.1 in both this period and the previous period) and anxiety (4.0 in both this period and the previous period) all remained stable.

188,"Estimates show low rates of coronavirus reinfections
The estimated number of coronavirus (COVID-19) reinfections in the UK between July 2020 and September 2021 is low overall, and reinfections more likely to cause serious illness are even lower. 
Analysis of the Coronavirus Infection Survey showed that between July 2020 and September 2021, the estimated rate for all reinfections was 11.8 per 100,000 participant days at risk. This includes those with a lower viral load.
The estimated rate for reinfections with a high viral load was 5.5 per 100,000 participant days at risk over the entire at-risk period.
The rate per 100,000 participant days at risk allows us to understand the rate of reinfection depending on how long participants have been ‘at risk’ of reinfection and accounts for participants having initial infection episodes and entering the ‘at-risk period’ at different times. 
There was a higher risk of reinfection in the period after 17 May 2021 compared to the period before because the Delta variant of COVID-19 was the dominant strain. 
Participants who had a lower viral load in their initial infection were at a higher risk of reinfection compared to participants who had a higher viral load at their initial infection. 
The analysis includes individuals who have had at least one positive test recorded in the survey and meet our criteria for being ""at risk"" of reinfection where:
 - 120 days has elapsed since an individual's first positive test in the survey and their most recent test result was negative
 - if 120 days has not passed since their first positive test in the survey, the individual's last positive test has been followed by four consecutive negative tests.

195,"House prices rising fastest in rural and coastal areas during the pandemic
Rising house prices and private rents mean that some workers are at risk of being priced out of living in rural and coastal areas, contributing to skill shortages in the tourism and hospitality industries that their local economies rely on. 
Despite falling from a record high in June, the average UK house price (£256,000) increased by 8.0% in July 2021 compared with the previous year. 
House prices were rising at three times the national rate in some rural and coastal areas in July, such as Conwy (25.0%), North Devon (22.5%) and Richmondshire (21.4%), continuing a trend seen during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Meanwhile, the seven areas that recorded house price falls in July were all London boroughs. 
Low transaction numbers can lead to volatility in house price estimates in some local authorities and London boroughs. These statistics should be used with this caveat in mind. 
Meanwhile, the RICS UK Residential Market Survey (PDF, 4.8MB) suggests that the supply of lettings is struggling to keep pace with tenant demand. 
It could be that some landlords are trying to capitalise on domestic tourism through holiday lets, meaning fewer long-term lets for prospective tenants. 
This is a particular issue for those looking to rent in tourist hotspots, where rates of second home ownership are much higher than average. Research suggests that many second homes have become holiday lets during the pandemic.

",https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/housepricesintouristhotspotsincreasinglyoutofreachforyoungandlowpaid/2021-09-28,"Rising house prices and private rents mean that some workers are at risk of being priced out of living in rural and coastal areas, contributing to skill shortages in the tourism and hospitality industries that their local economies rely on. 
28 September 2021
Young and low paid workers in tourist hotspots are increasingly facing the prospect of being unable to afford to live there. 
Despite falling from a record high in June, the average UK house price (£256,000) increased by 8.0% in July 2021 compared with the previous year. 
House prices were rising at three times the national rate in some rural and coastal areas in July, such as Conwy in North Wales (25.0%), North Devon (22.5%) and Richmondshire in the Yorkshire Dales (21.4%), continuing a trend seen during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Meanwhile, the seven areas that recorded house price falls in July were all London boroughs. 
House prices are increasing partly because of temporary changes to taxes paid on property purchases (including Stamp Duty in England and Northern Ireland), but they also reflect a shift in consumer preferences with growth being driven by rural and coastal areas. 
Prospective home buyers are seeking more space, with prices for detached houses (9.0% growth in July) consistently rising faster than terraced houses (7.7%) or flats (6.1%). 
As a result, people living in rural and coastal areas – particularly the young and those on lower incomes – are at risk of being priced out of the housing market. 
This could be contributing to hospitality businesses being unable to fill vacancies, with the industry being predominant in tourist areas and containing a high proportion of young and low paid workers. 
Data for top 10 and bottom 10 local authorities for annual house price growth in July 2021 (XLSX, 18KB)
The divergence in house price growth between London and elsewhere can be seen in tourist hotspots (the local authorities with the highest number of travel and tourism businesses per resident population). 
Eden, Powys, and Derbyshire Dales have all posted price rises of 10% or more in every month of 2021 so far (January to July). 
While also considered tourist hotspots, City of London, City of Westminster and Camden are the only areas to have seen prices decline for those seven consecutive months. 
There is some evidence of people house-hunting in rural areas, rather than in cities, because of a change in their circumstances during the pandemic, such as being able to work remotely. 
In September 2020, the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) found that 3 in 10 (29%) working adults in Great Britain had intended to continue working from home after the pandemic all or most of the time. Among those people, 12% said they had considered relocating, mostly to rural or coastal areas. 
However, while there has been a general pattern of people moving from urban to rural places in recent years, we do not have any data at this stage that suggest a stronger trend during the pandemic. 
Data for annual percentage change in house prices by local authority in January to July 2021 (XLSX, 38KB)
UK private rents increased by 1.3% in the 12 months to August, rising to 2.0% excluding London. 
The fastest rates of growth were in the East Midlands (2.7%) and the South West (2.6%), while London was the only region to record a decrease (-0.4%). 
The RICS UK Residential Market Survey (PDF, 4.8MB) suggests that an imbalance between tenant demand and the supply of lettings could be contributing to the increase in rental prices. 
In the three months to August 2021, RICS reported that tenant demand was accelerating while landlord instructions remained in decline. 
The fall in supply of lettings was most widespread in the Midlands, the East of England and the South West. 
It could be that some landlords are trying to capitalise on domestic tourism through holiday lets, leaving fewer long-term lets for prospective tenants. 
This is a particular issue for those looking to rent in tourist hotspots, where rates of second home ownership are much higher than average. Research suggests that many second homes have become holiday lets during the pandemic. 
Data for second home ownership by local authority in England and Wales (XLSX, 26 KB)
Those who work in tourist hotspots earn less on average than people who live there. 
For example, as of April 2020, Cotswold residents earned 28.7% more than people who were employed in the area. There were similar differences between the earnings of residents and workers in other tourist areas such as Derbyshire Dales (27.5%) and Allerdale (24.5%). 
This is comparable with areas of Outer London such as Bexley (29.0%) and Harrow (27.3%) that are subject to the “commuter effect”, where people who earn high incomes in the city centre live on the outskirts. 
In tourist hotspots, workers earn less than residents because of the types of jobs in those areas, with hospitality being the largest employer. 
The median hospitality salary for a full-time employee was £22,779 per year in April 2020, which was 28% lower than the national average of £31,461. 
Hospitality workers were also the most likely to be furloughed during the pandemic. On average, between 23 March 2020 and 31 July 2021, more than half of employees in hospitality were furloughed. 
As a result, tourist hotspots were among the areas with the highest average furlough rates during the pandemic. 
South Lakeland and Eden in the Lake District recorded the highest monthly furlough rates of anywhere in the country, at 40% and 39% respectively in June 2020. 
Data for furlough rates in tourist hotspots (XLSX, 27KB)
While house prices have been rising during the pandemic, many people have seen their income fall because of furlough, reduced hours or losing their job. 
The poorest fifth of workers were more likely than the richest fifth to see a drop in income in the 12 months to March 2021 (42% compared with 31%), according to recent analysis. 
Data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) show that young people (aged under 30) have been more likely to report reduced income than those aged over 60, but less likely to do so than 30- to 59-year-olds. 
However, young people remain worse off than other age groups in terms of their overall financial situation. A third (34%) of under 30s responding to the Survey on Living Conditions (SLC) had at least some difficulty making ends meet in the year to March 2021, the highest percentage of any age group. 
This has implications for the industries that tourism economies rely on, such as hospitality which is reporting record levels of job vacancies. 
Nearly a third of hospitality businesses were finding vacancies difficult to fill in late August 2021 (30%), amid reports of workers being priced out of buying or renting near their job. 
We do not yet know the full impact of coronavirus on housing affordability. The most recent data cover April 2020, towards the beginning of the pandemic and before the subsequent rise in house prices. 
The next housing affordability release (with data up to April 2021) is due to be published in spring 2022. 
There is further analysis of house price trends before and during the pandemic planned for October 2021.
In this article, we define tourist hotspots as the local authorities with the highest number of travel and tourism businesses per resident population. 
Using a list of travel and tourism industries, we found the average number of travel and tourism businesses (local units) in each local authority in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019, from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR). 
We then divided the resident population of each local authority by the number of travel and tourism businesses to identify tourist hotspots. 
The local authorities with the most travel and tourism businesses per resident population are as follows:

196,"People in big households more likely to test positive for COVID-19 
People who live in a household of three or more occupants were more likely to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) than those in single occupancy households. 
Those in younger age groups were more likely to test positive than those in older age groups, according to analysis of results from the Coronavirus Infection Survey for the fortnight ending 11 September 2021. 
Those living in more deprived areas were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than those in less-deprived areas 
People who had received one or two doses of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine were less likely to test positive than those who were not vaccinated. 
People who never wore a face covering in enclosed spaces had an increased likelihood of testing positive. 
Socially distanced contact with 11 or more people aged 18 to 69 years outside the home also increased the odds of catching COVID-19. 
Results of the analysis are presented as odds ratios. When a characteristic has an odds ratio of one, this means there is neither an increase nor a decrease in the likelihood of testing positive compared with a reference category. An odds ratio of higher than one means there is an increased likelihood of testing positive, compared with the reference category and an odds ratio of lower than one means there is a reduced likelihood. 
In the second wave, case rates were higher in households from lower socio-economic backgrounds than in more affluent ones. In the third wave, there was little difference between socio-economic groups other than for people who had never worked or were long-term unemployed, who had the lowest rates.
Overall, case rates were lower among disabled people than non-disabled people.

Almost two in three (65%) working adults in Great Britain reported travelling to work in the past seven days.
This is an increase of 8 percentage points compared with the period between 25 August and 5 September 2021 (57%).
This figure counts those who exclusively travelled to work as well as those who were both working from home and commuting.
The percentage of adults reporting always or often maintaining social distancing (45%) remained stable, having previously decreased as restrictions eased. This figure is now around half of what it was in mid-February (91%, 10 to 14 February 2021).
Around one in six (18%) adults reported that essential food items had not been available to buy at some point during the past two weeks. A quarter (25%) said they had not been able to purchase other non-essential food items, while 4% reported not being able to buy medicine or fuel. Around 6 in 10 (61%) reported everything they needed had been available to buy.

200,"Pandemic deprivation learning gap in England’s schools 
School children in England who were eligible for free school meals learned less during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns than those in more prosperous areas. 
The Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) analysis of data from Teacher Tapp showed that teachers at schools with the highest free school meal (FSM) eligibility rates (quartile 4) covered less material with remote learners relative to in-school learners throughout the COVID-19 period. 
Free school meals can be used as an indicator of deprivation because they are available to children whose parents receive some benefits or are on low incomes. 
Teachers at schools with the lowest FSM eligibility rates (quartile 1) said the material they had covered with remote learners was closer to what they were able to cover with in-school learners. 
A survey conducted by the  National Foundation for Educational Research found that pupils in the most deprived schools were twice as likely than those at the least deprived schools to have little or no access to Information Technology (IT).  
Teachers in the most deprived schools also reported only being in regular contact with an average of 50% of their pupils, compared with 67% of pupils in the least deprived schools.

The difference between the materials covered by remote and in-class pupils was larger for primary schools than for secondary schools; primary school pupils learning remotely covered a much smaller fraction of the learning materials than their in-class peers.
The proportion of instruction dependent on parents was much higher for primary schools than for secondary schools, and much higher for pupils in Key Stage 1 (aged 5 to 7 years) than pupils in Key Stage 2 (aged 7 to 11 years).
The difference between remote and in-class learning was particularly acute at schools with a higher proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals; remote learners at these schools covered a smaller fraction of in-class learning materials than remote learners at schools with a lower proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals
Teachers at schools with lower proportions of pupils eligible for free school meals also reported pupils’ learning being less dependent on parental instruction than teachers at schools with a higher proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals.
Remote learning has been less effective for the teaching of some subjects than for others; teachers reported a larger reduction in materials covered by remote learners relative to in-school learners for arts, including design and technology than for other subjects.
Data show little evidence of large differences in materials covered or dependence on parental instruction in different English regions.

201,"Household emissions fell by 10% in 2020 
Household greenhouse gas emissions from heating, travel and other activities fell from 148 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent in 2019 to 133 million tonnes in 2020, while total UK emissions fell 13%. 
CO2 equivalent is a measure of the combined global-warming potential of various greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide as well as carbon dioxide. 
The 10% drop in household emissions is the second greatest annual reduction since the series began in 1990. Only 2011 saw a greater reduction when household emissions fell by 12%, possibly caused by 2011 being one of the warmest years on record. 
The fall in 2020 was largely driven by personal travel emissions, which dropped by 24% compared with 2019. Household emissions not related to travel increased slightly, by 1.5%, with more people staying at home and using energy for heating.

",https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/covid19restrictionscuthouseholdemissions/2021-09-21,"With more people staying at home last year, household greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 10%. Could the shift to home working see lower emissions in the longer term?
21 September 2021
A sharp reduction in personal travel, including commuting to work, drove household greenhouse gas emissions down by 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent in 2020. This drop is equivalent to about 3% of total emissions in 2019. 
CO2 equivalent is a measure of the combined global-warming potential of various greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide as well as carbon dioxide. 
With many people working remotely, being on furlough, or losing their job in 2020, more people were staying at home using energy for heating. However, these additional emissions were more than offset by the drop in travel emissions. 
With reduced industrial emissions, households have been the single biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the UK since 2015. Both the energy and manufacturing sectors have reduced emissions significantly over the last decade, while household emissions have remained relatively high. This has increased interest in reducing household emissions to help cut overall emissions to “net zero” by 2050. 
Net zero would mean that total UK emissions would be equal to or less than those removed from the environment, achieved by a combination of reduction and removal of emissions. 
While a move to greater long-term homeworking may see transport emissions fall, other activities could push emissions back up and even reverse the effect. 
Most people (85%) who worked from home during the pandemic expect to use a “hybrid” approach of both home and office work in the future, according to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. Another 4% expect to work only from home. 
If you have started travelling in to work less often, you can explore how this might affect your carbon footprint with our interactive tool.
Total household emissions - including personal transport, and heating and other activities – fell from 148 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019 to 133 million tonnes in 2020, as total UK emissions fell from 552 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent to 481 million tonnes. 
The 10% drop in household emissions is the second greatest annual reduction since the Office for National Statistics (ONS) first aggregated them in 1990. Only 2011 saw a greater reduction when household emissions fell 12%, possibly caused by 2011 being one of the warmest years on record. 
Last year’s drop of 15 million tonnes in household emissions is roughly the same as the CO2 produced by one and a quarter years of coal use at the UK’s pre-pandemic rate of consumption.
Household emissions come primarily from heating the home and personal transport, such as commuting and recreational travel. Between 2019 and 2020, household emissions not relating to travel, which are mostly heating emissions, increased 1.5% from 80 million tonnes CO2, equivalent to 81 million tonnes. 
But the same period saw household transport emissions (not including industrial transport) drop 24%, from 68 million tonnes CO2 equivalent to 52 million tonnes. This is by far the greatest drop seen in such emissions since the series began in 1990. 
The 16 million tonne fall in transport emissions means just under one quarter (23%) of the total drop in UK emissions in 2020 was because of changes in personal travel.
Particulate matter air pollution also fell significantly and it may be the improvement in air quality that many people noticed during the lockdowns. 
PM2.5, which is made up of particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, pose a serious risk to human health. Research suggests that PM2.5 may lead to a loss of six months of life expectancy from birth for UK residents. 
PM2.5 levels were down 7% across the UK, from 114 thousand tonnes in 2019 to 107 thousand tonnes in 2020. There were also drops in other air pollutants, such as PM10 (down 8%), carbon monoxide and benzene (both down 6%).
Recently released ONS data on household spending seems to reinforce the notion that the drop in transport emissions was driven partly by the increase in home working. 
As we might expect, households spent less on travel and more on housing, fuel and power. This shift was more pronounced among the highest income households – the members of which are more likely to work in jobs that can be done from home. 
Households in the lowest 20% income group went from spending a weekly average of £34.90 on transport in 2019 to £27.10 in 2020, a 22% drop. In the same period, the highest-earning 20% went from spending £141.80 per week on transport to £94.50, a 33% drop. 
For the lowest income households, spending on housing, fuel and power went down slightly from £70.20 to £69.10 per week, while the highest income households increased spending from a weekly average of £98.40 in 2019 to £104.00 in 2020. 
The shift in spending on housing, fuel and power may be because higher income households were more likely to work from home but may also be because higher income households are more likely to live in larger properties that can cost more to heat.
The increase in home working represents only one of many dynamics that will determine the overall environmental impact of COVID-19. 
These data suggest that households and the broader economy have made substantial changes during 2020. Some may have also felt an increased dependence on the natural world, with over 40% of respondents to a Natural England survey saying green spaces had become more important to their wellbeing since the beginning of the pandemic.
But many of the changes that have been made - and are still being made - are hard to quantify from an emissions perspective. Greenhouse gases produced to heat homes and for personal travel remain a considerable proportion of UK emissions, and it will be interesting to see how trends develop in the provisional figures for 2021 this time next year and to undertake further analysis to help inform policy and the public in this area.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) case rates in England were highest among people living in the most deprived areas and in urban areas throughout the pandemic.
Analysis examined socio-demographic characteristics of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) from 1 September 2020 to 25 July 2021.
This period covers the second wave of infections in the UK (1 September 2020 to 22 May 2021) and the start of the third wave (23 May 2021 to 25 July 2021). Testing was not widely available in the first wave of the pandemic to produce any comparable data. Case rates are per 100,000 people, measured by week.
By ethnic group, case rates were highest among Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups during the second wave, whereas in the first part of the third wave, the White British group had the highest case rate. This is after accounting for the age structure of different ethnic groups.
In the second wave, case rates were higher in households from lower socio-economic backgrounds than in more affluent ones. In the third wave, there was little difference between socio-economic groups other than for people who had never worked or were long-term unemployed, who had the lowest rates.
Overall, case rates were lower among disabled people than non-disabled people.

204,"Mortality rate lowest among double vaccinated
Weekly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) are lower for those who have received two vaccine doses than those who have received one dose or are unvaccinated.
ASMRs account for differences in population size and age of the vaccination status groups over time.
In people who received their second dose at least 21 days before their date of death, 0.8% of all deaths involved COVID-19. Over one-third (37.4%) of all deaths in unvaccinated people involved COVID-19.
A death involving COVID-19 occurring in someone who has received both vaccine doses, and had a first positive PCR test at least 14 days after the second vaccination dose, is known as a “breakthrough death”. In total, there were 256 breakthrough deaths between 2 January and 2 July 2021.

205,"Weekly household spending fell by over £100 during the pandemic
UK households reduced their spending by an average of £109.10, or 19%, a week during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (the year to March 2021). 
During the year to March 2021, households spent less on goods and services that were restricted at various times to control the spread of coronavirus. 
Households also may have been able to cut back on spending if they were able to shift to home working. Higher income households, who tended to spend more on travel pre-pandemic, and whose workers were more likely to be able to work from home, saw a larger drop in spending than low income households. 
However, for some, the reduction in spending may have been associated with a fall in income. Around a third of workers saw their household income fall in the financial year ending (FYE) 2021, rising to 42% for the 20% on the lowest incomes (who were more likely to be furloughed and less likely to be able to work from home than people on higher incomes). 
While both spending and income fell for many UK households, people are on average finding it easier to make ends meet, with the proportion of people reporting difficulty in making ends meet falling by six percentage points from 34% in the year to March 2020 to 28% in the year ending March 2021.

During the year to March 2021, households spent less on goods and services that were restricted at various times to control the spread of coronavirus. At the height of the spring 2020 lockdown, more than one-fifth of usual household spending was largely prevented. 
Households may have been able to cut back on spending if they were able to shift to home working. Higher income households, who tended to spend more on travel pre-pandemic, and whose workers were more likely to be able to work from home, saw a larger drop in spending than low income households. 
However, for some, the reduction in spending may have been associated with a fall in income. Around a third of workers saw their household income fall in the financial year ending (FYE) 2021, rising to 42% for the 20% on the lowest incomes (who were more likely to be furloughed and less likely to be able to work from home than people on higher incomes). 
While both spending and income fell for many UK households, people are on average finding it easier to make ends meet, with the proportion of people reporting difficulty in making ends meet falling by six percentage points from 34% in the year to March 2020 to 28% in the year ending March 2021. 
Those who had experienced a loss of income were more likely to also report financial pressures, such as difficulty making ends meet. How the pandemic has affected a person or household financially differed by employment status, age and ethnicity. 
Restrictions brought into place to curb the spread of coronavirus, and the changes in behaviours many people adopted due to the pandemic, meant that households did not spend as much in the last year as they would usually. 
The highest income households saw a larger drop in spending than the lowest. 
Notes
Reduced spending on restaurants and hotels, recreation and culture and transport contributed most to the decline in overall spending for all income groups. 
The highest income households, whose working members were more likely to work in jobs that could be carried out from home, saw spending on housing, fuel, and power rise during the pandemic, while the poorest households saw spending in this area fall. 
Data for contributions to change in weekly household spending by category and income quintile (XLSX, 19KB)
Increased spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks had a larger impact on expenditure in the poorest households. Lower income households spent proportionally more in this area pre-pandemic, with spending in this area making up around 15% of total expenditure for poorest 20% of households, compared with 8% for the richest fifth in FYE 2020. In FYE 2021 this increased to 18% for the lowest income households, and to 12% for those on the highest incomes. 
Falling demand for transport on the other hand contributed more to drops in spending among the richest fifth of households, with spending on international flights and personal vehicles both seeing large falls. 
Much of reduced spending across all income groups was due to households not travelling abroad. Spending on international holidays (including accommodation, travel and food) accounted for half of reduced spending on average in the highest income households. Among lower income households, travel abroad accounted for a third of reduced spending. 
Data for contribution of spending on holidays abroad to falls in total spending by income quintile (XLSX, 19KB)
While many households saw their spending fall dramatically during the pandemic, substantial changes in the economy meant that many also saw their income fall. 
Workers on lower incomes were more likely to report decreases in income in the year to March 2021 compared to the previous financial year, with 42% of those on the lowest income reporting a decrease, compared with 31% for those on the highest incomes. 
This could be because of the types of jobs in different income groups. During the first national lockdown in spring 2020, workers on lower incomes were more likely to be furloughed and less likely to be able to work from home than those on higher incomes. 
Jobs at greater risk during lockdowns, because they were not likely to be classed as key worker roles or able to be carried out from home, were also lower paid on average than jobs that were less vulnerable during the pandemic. 
People on higher incomes were also more likely to be paid in full if they were unable to work, compared with those on lower incomes.

Taking both the changes to spending and income into account, households typically saw lower levels of spending relative to income during the pandemic. However, higher income households saw a larger spending drop relative to their income than those on lower incomes, providing them with greater opportunity to save or ease financial pressures. 
In all income groups, the proportion of households whose weekly spending exceeded weekly income fell in the last financial year compared with FYE 2020. However, among the poorest households, two-fifths (40%) still spent more than they had in disposable income (money available after income tax and national insurance contributions).
On average, spending among the poorest households was roughly equal to their disposable income in FYE 2021, while the richest households spent less than half the size of their disposable income.
Data for disposable income to spending ratios by income quintile (XLSX, 19KB)
Data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) suggest that those on higher incomes were able to recover faster from the financial shocks of the first national lockdown. 
Between April and June 2020, the proportion of people in different income groups using their savings to cover living costs varied, but from Summer 2020, those with an annual income under £20,000 were one-and-a-half times as likely to be using their savings than those on higher incomes. 
Throughout the pandemic, those paid less than £20,000 were also between two and three-and-a-half times more likely to be furloughed than those on higher salaries. 
Data for percentage of furloughed workers and percentage that used savings to cover living costs (XLSX, 22KB)
As well as household income, characteristics such as employment type, age and ethnicity have affected how the pandemic has impacted individuals’ finances. During the pandemic, people’s ability to make ends meet increased, but this varied across different groups. For some, such as self-employed workers, the ability to make ends meet declined. 
Data for percentage of people able to make ends meet (XLSX, 19KB)
Throughout the pandemic, self-employed workers were consistently more likely to report reduced hours and reduced income than employees. 
At the end of March 2021, as the third lockdown started to ease, 28% of self-employed workers continued to report reduced hours compared to just 5% of employees. Similarly, over a third (34%) reported reduced income compared to just 10% of employees. 
Self-employed workers were also more than twice as likely as employees to report borrowing money during the pandemic, although this gap narrowed during the Summer of 2021, as restrictions were lifted. In the week to 1 August 2021, more than 7% of self-employed workers were using savings, compared with less than 3% of employees. 
This may reflect self-employed workers’ higher likelihood of having significant savings to draw on. On average, more than three-quarters (76%) of self-employed households had enough financial assets to cover a 25% fall in their household employment income, and 61% could cover a 75% fall for three months.
Previous analysis covering the period before the pandemic has highlighted significant inequality in income and wealth by ethnic group. 
Between May 2020 and February 2021, those of Black ethnicity were the most likely to report falling behind with many bills (3%), and to find keeping up with bills a heavy burden (20%) – a higher proportion than in the whole population. 
Data for percentage of people experiencing various financial pressures by ethnic group (XLSX, 19KB)
Data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) also suggest that ethnic minority populations have not recovered from the economic shocks of the pandemic as quickly as those of White ethnicity. From Summer 2020, the proportion of the White population using savings to cover living costs steadily declined, even through the early 2021 lockdown. 
While the proportion of ethnic minorities using savings to cover living costs was similar to the White population during Summer 2020, this figure increased in the third national lockdown, and remained at a similar level (almost 7%) in early Summer 2021, compared with just 3% among the White population. 
Ethnic minorities were also consistently more likely to report needing to borrow money or use credit throughout the pandemic.
Younger people were more likely to report financial pressures than older age groups, with people aged under 35 years most likely to find keeping up with bills a heavy burden (9%). 
Labour market statistics show that younger people were more likely to be furloughed during FYE 2021, and those aged 16 to 24 years were particularly affected, experiencing a greater decline in employment rate compared to those aged 25 years and over. 
However, over the last quarter (April to June 2021) there was a stronger increase in the employment rate for young people – suggesting that the reopening of parts of the economy has allowed young people to either return from furlough or find new work. 
Older age groups held more savings in the run up to the pandemic. 
The median balance on individual current accounts, savings and ISAs was more than six times higher for people aged 65 years and over compared to that of those aged 25 to 34 years in the ten months to February 2021, suggesting older age groups were better insulated from some of the financial hits of lockdown.
The article draws on findings from the Living Costs and Food Survey, the Survey on Living Conditions, the Wealth and Assets Survey, and the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. These surveys’ time periods, geographies and data collection methods all differ slightly. 
The Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) is a UK household survey designed to provide information on household expenditure patterns and food consumption. 
The most recent LCF technical report covers methods and data collection up to financial year ending (FYE) 2020. For a more in-depth explanation of LCF processes and methodology, refer to the  FYE 2016 technical report. 
Please note that the FYE 2021 data are provisional estimates that have not yet been processed as comprehensively as previous years. Moreover, the current datasets include 69% of the data collected in FYE 2021. Revised financial year end family spending data will be published in Summer 2022 and the ONS regular income and inequality bulletin will be published in January 2022. 
During FYE 2021 respondents did not complete a face-to-face interview with questions on regular items of household expenditure and income details, instead respondents participated in telephone interviews. In addition, respondents were asked to provide copies of receipts (electronic or paper) for the two-week diary period; and interviewers recorded non-receipt based expenditure via additional regular telephone calls during the two-week diary period. 
An additional housing tenure calibration control has been added to the calculation of weights in this provisional FYE 2021 dataset to adjust for changes in the demographics of the LCF respondents during the pandemic, following the switch from face to face to telephone collection. 
The provisional FYE 2021 data have not been adjusted for outliers and do not include any partial households. ONS’ typical annual family spending adjusts for unusually high expenditure and income values (outliers). 
Data reference tables are published alongside this report, these provide information on response, characteristics of the sample, confidence intervals and statistical significance testing. All spending estimates are rounded to the nearest £0.10. 
The Survey on Living Conditions (SLC) is a six-year wave survey that provides information on household income. 
This analysis is based on 23,736 responses from individuals in Great Britain collected between April 2020 and March 2021, which have been linked to the previous wave of data collection (April 2019 and March 2020) where available. 
As such, the SLC is able to look at how the situation has changed from one year to the next for a cohort of households. 
Further information about the survey’s sampling and weighting are available in ONS personal and economic wellbeing bulletins sections on measuring the data and strengths and limitations. 
Data collection for the eighth round of the Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) is currently in progress and will cover the period April 2020 to March 2022. WAS data used in this release are based on over 12,000 individuals in Great Britain, aged 16 years or over and not in full-time education, who responded in person between May 2020 and February 2021. 
To provide timely data, these early indicator estimates were produced before data processing or imputation. Estimates of financial assets should be treated with particular caution and may be updated in future releases. No formal significance testing has been undertaken at this stage. 
More information on the WAS, how the data are collected, strengths, limitations, and appropriate uses is available in the WAS QMI. 
In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the WAS changed from face-to-face to telephone collection. The full extent of the impact of this change is not yet known. 
Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) data used in this article are drawn from the survey’s weekly module that asks about the impact of the pandemic on day-to-day life. For the time periods covered in each module, please see our reference tables. For some analyses we have used pooled data covering several weeks, detailed in our reference tables. 
The two-category ethnicity breakdown includes: 
The survey results are weighted to be a nationally representative sample for Great Britain, and data are collected using an online self-completion questionnaire. Individuals who did not want to or were unable to complete the survey online had the opportunity to take part over the phone. 
The responding sample in the week 28 July 2021 to 1 August 2021 contained 5999 individuals (64% response rate). Survey weights were applied to make estimates representative of the population. 
Further information on the quality and methodology of all surveys can be found in the measuring the data section of our previous personal and economic wellbeing releases.

206,"Infections increase in Scotland and Wales
Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections remained level in England in the week ending 3 September 2021.
In Scotland in the week ending 3 September, estimated infections increased and were the highest we have recorded. The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey began to cover Scotland in September 2020.
In Northern Ireland, the trend in infections was uncertain in the week ending 3 September. In Wales, infections increased in the week ending 3 September.
The estimated percentage of the community population (those not in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings) that had COVID-19 in the latest week was:
 - 1.38% in England (1 in 70 people), compared with 1.41% in (1 in 70 people) the week before
 - 1.54% in Wales (1 in 65 people), compared with 0.92% (1 in 110 people) the week before
 - 1.74% in Northern Ireland (1 in 60 people), compared with 1.56% (1 in 65 people) the week before
 - 2.23% in Scotland (1 in 45 people), up from with 1.32% (1 in 75 people) the week before
In England, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged two years to school Year 11 and those aged 35 to 49 years. The percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged 70 years and over in the two weeks up to 3 September 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. The percentage of people testing positive decreased for those aged 25 to 34 and 50 to 69 years.
The highest percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in England was seen in the North East and Yorkshire and The Humber. In the week ending 3 September 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the North East, decreased in the North West, and remained level in London and the South East, while the trend was uncertain in other regions.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/10september2021,"In England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) remained level in the week ending 3 September 2021; we estimate that 754,600 people within the community population in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 704,000 to 808,800), equating to around 1 in 70 people.
In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the week ending 3 September 2021; we estimate that 46,800 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 35,700 to 59,500), equating to around 1 in 65 people.
In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain in the week ending 3 September 2021; we estimate that 31,800 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 23,000 to 41,800), equating to around 1 in 60 people.
In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the week ending 3 September 2021; we estimate that 117,300 people in Scotland had COVID-19, (95% credible interval: 98,300 to 137,300) equating to around 1 in 45 people.

207,"One in ten adults report being asked for COVID-19 status
Around 1 in 10 of all adults (11%) across Great Britain report having been asked to show proof that they have either been vaccinated against coronavirus (COVID-19), or that they have recently tested negative, to be allowed into a venue or event.
Some large venues such as football stadia and music festivals have already been asking people to prove their COVID-19 status.
The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) for 25 August to 5 September 2021 also asked the 11% of adults who had been asked for proof of vaccination or a negative test where this had happened, with sporting events and festivals the most common places to have requested it.
Between 25 August and 5 September 2021, 46% of adults in Great Britain reported always or often maintaining social distancing. This figure is now around half of what it was in mid-February (91%, 10 to 14 February 2021), during the full lockdown.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/10september2021,"This wave, over the period of 25 August to 5 September 2021, based on adults in Great Britain:
A high proportion of adults still felt that measures to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) were either very important or important; the measures included wearing a face covering (87% this wave, 88% last wave between the period 18 and 22 August) and socially distancing from others not in their household (87% this wave, 86% last wave).
The proportion of adults reporting to wear face coverings at some point in the last seven days when outside their home (89%) was similar to last wave (90%), as was the proportion of adults who always or often maintain social distancing (46% this wave, 45% last wave). 
The proportion of adults that reported self-isolating in the last seven days remained relatively stable (3% this wave, 4% last wave).
The main reasons adults self-isolated in the last seven days were because of testing positive for COVID-19 (31%), having coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms (21%) and have been in contact with someone who have tested positive for COVID-19 (20%).
Personal well-being measures remained stable compared with the last wave, with life satisfaction (7.1), feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile (7.3), happiness (7.1) all remaining unchanged from the previous wave, apart from anxiety (3.8) which has increased slightly.

208,"London sees the largest rise in online job adverts since March
The total volume of UK online job adverts on 3 September 2021 increased by 2% week-on-week, to 128% of the February 2020 average.
The “transport/logistics/warehouse” category remains that with the highest amount of job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic level, at 326%.
Data for the total volume of online job adverts by category, 4 January 2019 to 3 September 2021 (XLXS, 31KB) 
Over the same period online job adverts in London and Northern Ireland both rose by 9%. This is the largest week-on-week increase in online job adverts in London since 5 March 2021.
Despite the significant week-on-week increase, London remains the region with the lowest volume of online job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic level – at 109% of the February 2020 average.

The seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,589 in the week ending 5 September 2021, a 5% increase from the previous week and the highest average number of UK flights seen for almost 18 months. (EUROCONTROL). Section 3.
In the week to 2 September 2021, the aggregate CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases increased by 6 percentage points from the previous week, to 99% of its February 2020 average (Bank of England CHAPS data). Section 4.
The number of new Value Added Tax (VAT) reporters in August 2021 (21,000) was 18% higher than in August 2020 (17,730) but 2% lower than August 2019 (21,490) (HM Revenue and Customs VAT returns). Section 5.
In the week to 6 September 2021, the seven-day average estimate of UK seated diners fell by 28 percentage points from the previous week to 128% of the level in the equivalent week of 2019; however, the previous week included a bank holiday (OpenTable). Section 6.
On 3 September 2021, online job adverts in London increased by 9% from the previous week, the largest week-on-week increase in London since 5 March 2021; despite this, it remains the region with the lowest volume of online job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic level (Adzuna). Section 7.
In the week to 4 September 2021, overall retail footfall in the UK decreased slightly from the previous week and was at 84% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019 (Springboard). Section 8.
Of businesses not permanently stopped trading, 13% reported that vacancies were more difficult to fill in the last month compared with normal expectations for this time of year, in late August 2021; this is up from 9% in early August 2021 (Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS), 23 August to 5 September 2021). Section 9.
89% of adults who left their home reported wearing a face covering in the latest week; this was broadly similar to the previous survey (Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, 18 to 22 August 2021). Section 10.
There was an average of 290 daily ship visits in the week to 5 September 2021, a 2% decrease from the previous week; the average number of daily cargo ship visits saw a slight week-on-week increase of 1% (exactEarth). Section 11.
The volume of motor vehicle traffic on Monday 6 September 2021 was at 100% of its level in the first week of February 2020 (Department for Transport). Section 12.
In the week ending 5 September 2021, the seasonally adjusted average count of traffic camera activity for pedestrians and cyclists in London had increased by 5% from the previous week to 129% of its pre-pandemic level (Transport for London). See the accompanying dataset.
There were 12,385 company incorporations in the week to 3 September 2021, a decrease of 10% from the previous week and a similar level to the equivalent week of 2019 (12,714); the main reason for this lower volume is the four-day working week caused by the bank holiday. See the accompanying dataset.
There were 4,880 voluntary dissolution applications in the week to 3 September 2021; a decrease of 16% from the previous week (see previous main point) but 6% higher than the equivalent week of 2019 (4,594) (Companies House). See the accompanying dataset.

Results presented in this bulletin are experimental and may be subject to revision. 

These data are daily flight figures from the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL). Daily flight numbers for the UK alongside other countries are available in EUROCONTROL's dashboard. EUROCONTROL is a pan-European, civil-military organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation. Its Aviation Intelligence and Performance Review Unit provides independent collection and validation of air navigation services performance-related data and intelligence gathering.
The flights data include international arrivals and departures to and from the UK (including crown dependencies) and domestic UK flights, but exclude overflights (flights that pass over UK territory). They capture all flight movements that operate under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), where the pilot uses instruments in the flight deck to control, guide and adjust the plane. This includes commercial flights carrying passengers and cargo as well as non-commercial flights such as private and military flights.
Data from EUROCONTROL do not include information on the volume of passengers or cargo carried on UK flights. Especially in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, flights might not be operating at full capacity and therefore trends in passengers and cargo will differ from trends in flights presented here.

In the week ending 5 September 2021, the seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,589, a 5% increase from the previous week (3,405) and a 15% increase from 3,111 the previous month (week ending 8 August 2021). This is the highest weekly average number of UK flights seen for almost 18 months (since 19 March 2020). 
The seven-day average number of UK daily flights has increased by 151% from the week ending 23 May 2021, the week that international travel was allowed to restart and the UK government implemented the travel traffic light system (17 May 2021).
The average number of UK daily flights in the latest week was at 54% and 127% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
The full data time series available for UK flights can be found in the accompanying dataset, which contains daily flight numbers and the rolling seven-day averages.
These data series are experimental faster indicators for estimating UK spending on credit and debit cards. They track the daily CHAPS payments made by credit and debit card payment processors to around 100 major UK retail corporates. These payments are the proceeds of recent credit and debit card transactions made by customers at their stores, both via physical and online platforms. More information on the indicator is provided in the accompanying methodology article.  
Companies are allocated to one of four categories based on their primary business:   
Figure 2 shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors, ""merchant acquirers"".  
In the week to 2 September 2021, the CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases in aggregate increased by 6 percentage points from the previous week to 99% of its February 2020 average level. All spending categories increased in this latest week: 
The week to 2 September overlapped with the August pay day and the Summer Bank Holiday. Users should note this when comparing aggregate spending and spending by category in the week to 2 September 2021 with the week to 26 August 2021.
In the latest week, “work-related” and “staple” spending were above their February 2020 average levels, at 118% and 108%, respectively. Conversely, “delayable” and “social” spending were at 94% and 92% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively. 
In August 2021, the monthly CHAPS-based indicator of aggregate credit and debit card spending was at 96% of its February 2020 average level, which is broadly unchanged from July 2021.
This is the fifth consecutive month that the monthly index has been greater than 90%, with September and December 2020 the only other times since March 2020 where this was the case.
The monthly data time series is available in the accompanying dataset and includes methodological notes that users should bear in mind. The monthly CHAPS index is calculated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), rather than being an additional series that is produced and validated by the Bank of England.
The new reporters index measures the number of UK firms sending Value Added Tax (VAT) returns to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for the first time, which is related to the number of business creations.

There were 21,000 new VAT reporters in the UK in August 2021, a decrease of 4% from 21,930 in July 2021. The number of new VAT reporters in August 2021 was 18% higher than in August 2020 (17,730) but 2% lower than August 2019 (21,490). This is also slightly higher than the 2015 to 2019 longer-term average (20,878).
The number of new reporters in the production industry rose by 13% from 970 in July 2021 to 1,100 in August 2021. In the services industry, there were 15,900 new VAT reporters in August 2021, a 7% decrease from the 17,140 reported in July 2021.
The figures explained in this section refer to seasonally adjusted data. Non-seasonally adjusted data are available in the accompanying dataset.
Turnover diffusion indices are an aggregate measure used to track whether most firms are reporting an increase or decrease in turnover in their VAT returns. They are calculated as the percentage of firms with increasing turnover minus the percentage with decreasing turnover.
The heatmap in Figure 4 is a visual way of showing the VAT diffusion indices based on the standard deviation from their historical 2008 to 2019 average. Larger deviations are more darkly coloured, with red representing a negative change, while teal represents a positive change when compared with the previous period.
The month-on-month, all-industry turnover estimate for July 2021 shows that in the past month, out of 38,550 firms, more firms have reported decreasing rather than increasing turnover (net negative 3%). This is the largest negative net difference since April 2020, although it is important to note that these data are unweighted and we do not have information on the size of the changes reported.
A net 6% of firms in the construction industry reported decreasing turnover in July 2021. This is the fifth consecutive month where more firms have reported decreasing turnover than increasing turnover in the construction industry. A net 4% and 2% of firms in the agriculture and production industries, respectively, reported decreasing turnover in July 2021. Meanwhile, in the services industry, an equal number of firms (net 0%) reported increasing turnover as those that reported decreasing turnover in the last month.
The figures explained in this section refer to seasonally adjusted data. Non-seasonally adjusted data are available in the accompanying dataset.
OpenTable is a provider of data for online restaurant reservations, with daily data for the UK, London and Manchester being publicly available in its The state of the industry dashboard. These data show the impact of recent events and restrictions on the hospitality industry using a sample of restaurants on the OpenTable network across all channels, that is, online reservations, phone reservations, and walk-ins.

According to OpenTable, in the week to 6 September 2021, the seven-day average estimate of UK seated diners decreased by 28% when compared with the previous week, and was 128% of its level in the equivalent week of 2019. However, this fall follows a week that included a bank holiday (30 August 2021) and is still notably higher than the comparable week in 2020, which was 92% of the equivalent week of 2019.
In the latest week, the seven-day average estimate of seated diners in Manchester fell by 47 percentage points to 130% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. During the same period, the equivalent figure for London was 81%, a decrease of 16 percentage points from the previous week. 
The UK seven-day average estimate of seated diners has remained above the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019 since the week ending 17 May 2021 (following the reopening of indoor hospitality in England on 17 May 2021). In the period since this reopening to the latest week, the average estimate of UK seated diners was 132% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019.
These figures are experimental estimates of online job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, by category, by UK country and English region. The number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour. The Adzuna categories used do not correspond to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Vacancy Survey.
Further category breakdowns are included in the  online job advert estimates dataset and more details on the methodology can be found in Using Adzuna data to derive an indicator of weekly vacancies.
Users should note that week-on-week changes in online job advert volumes are outlined as percentages, rather than as percentage point changes. Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the charts and accompanying dataset.
According to Adzuna, on 3 September 2021, the total volume of online job adverts in the UK increased by 2% from the previous week (27 August 2021). 
Of the 28 categories, 15 saw a weekly increase in the number of online job adverts, 6 were unchanged, while the remaining 7 decreased when compared with the previous week. The largest weekly increase was in “legal”, which rose by 25%. This represents a recovery in the volume of online job adverts for “legal” after a significant dip throughout August 2021 and is now at similar levels to the end of July (30 July 2021). This seasonal pattern is consistent with previous years. The largest weekly fall was in “education”, which fell by 5%.
The total volume of online job adverts remained substantially above pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic volume, at 128% of its February 2020 average level. The “transport, logistics and warehouse” category remained that with the highest amount of job adverts relative to its February 2020 average pre-pandemic level, at 326%.
There are only six categories that are now below pre-pandemic levels. The lowest of these is ""education”, which is at 83% of its February 2020 average level. 
On 3 September 2021, the volume of online job adverts remained unchanged in 6 of the 12 UK countries and English regions when compared with the previous week (27 August 2021). Only the East Midlands saw a decrease, falling slightly by 1% from the previous week. Meanwhile, online job adverts in London and Northern Ireland both rose by 9%. This is the largest week-on-week increase in online job adverts in London since 5 March 2021. 
In the latest week, volumes of online job adverts remained above their February 2020 average levels in all UK countries and English regions. The highest of these were in the North East, Northern Ireland and East Midlands, at 171%, 166% and 156% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively. The North East has been the region with the highest number of online job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic levels since 9 April 2021.
Despite the significant week-on-week increase, London remains the region with the lowest volume of online job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic level at 109% of its February 2020 average level.

According to Springboard, in the week to 4 September 2021, the volume of overall retail footfall in the UK decreased slightly by 1% from the previous week (week to 28 August 2021). In the latest week, retail footfall in high streets decreased by 3%, in shopping centres it remained broadly unchanged from the previous week, and in retail parks it increased slightly by 1%.
In the latest week to 4 September 2021, overall retail footfall was at 84% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. Comparing retail locations, footfall at retail parks remained the strongest relative to pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels, at 97% of its equivalent 2019 level. Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for high streets and shopping centres were 81% and 78%, respectively. Throughout most of the pandemic, footfall at retail parks has consistently been strongest when compared with other retail locations, relative to their 2019 levels.

Final data for Wave 38 (reference period 9 August to 22 August 2021) of the Business Impact of COVID-19 Survey (BICS) can be found in Business insights and impacts on the UK economy: 9 September 2021.
In late August 2021, of businesses not permanently stopped trading, 13% reported that vacancies were more difficult to fill in the last month compared with normal expectations for this time of year. This is up from 9% in early August 2021. Businesses that reported difficulties filling vacancies in the last month compared with normal expectations were asked for the reasons for the difficulty. Approximately two in three (67%) of those businesses that are finding vacancies more difficult to fill than normal gave the reason of a lack of suitable applicants.
Further information can also be found in the Business insights and impact on the UK economy dataset.
This section includes some provisional results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) covering the period 25 August to 5 September 2021. The survey went out to 5,003 adults in Great Britain and had a response rate of 68% (3,387 responses). Further information to help understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain will be available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain, due to be updated on 10 September 2021.
The OPN has now moved to a fortnightly data collection. The same information as has been provided previously will be included within the fortnightly release.
In the period 25 August to 5 September 2021, the proportion of working adults in Great Britain who in the past seven days:
Of the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for food and medicine increased slightly by 2 percentage points from the previous survey to 84%.
The proportion of these adults who shopped for things other than food and medicine in the last seven days was broadly unchanged from the previous survey at 46%.
Of the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so and reported wearing a face covering was broadly similar to the previous survey at 89%. Further breakdowns such as the situation when a face covering was worn (for example, while shopping) and by country, will be available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain due to be published on 10 September 2021.
A changeover in the systems used to collect these data has introduced a level shift in the data time series from 14 June 2021 onwards, and users should not make comparisons between data before and after this date. The data produced prior to the change, for 1 April 2019 to 13 June 2021, can still be compared within that period.
A full methodological review of our current method of data collection is underway and data may be subject to revision once this is complete. We will continue to update the accompanying dataset using the current method until the review is complete.

Week-on-two-week (23 August 2021) comparisons are made this week to avoid comparing against the lower level of motor vehicle traffic seen in the previous week because of the Summer Bank Holiday.
According to Department for Transport (DfT) non-seasonally adjusted road traffic data, the volume of all motor vehicle traffic on 6 September 2021 was at 100% of the level seen on the Monday of the first week in February 2020; this is broadly similar to two weeks ago. 
Compared with 23 August 2021, traffic volume for cars was unchanged, at 96% of the level seen in the first week of February 2020. Heavy goods vehicles and light commercial vehicles increased slightly by 3 and 2 percentage points from two weeks ago to 109% and 110%, respectively.

A faster indicator provides insights into economic activity using close-to-real-time big data, administrative data sources, rapid response surveys or Experimental Statistics, which represent useful economic and social concepts. 
Incorporations are when a company is added to the Companies House register of limited companies. This can also include where an existing business applies to become a limited company, where it was not one before. 
A voluntary dissolution application is when a company applies to begin dissolution proceedings. As such, they effectively chose to be removed from the Companies House register. For a company to be eligible to voluntarily dissolve, it should not have completed any trading activity for a period of three months. 
A new reporter is defined as a firm with a Value Added Tax (VAT) reference (that is, firm identification number), which has not previously reported its VAT returns. New reporters are published within one month of the end of the reporting period. The new reporting behaviour measure is classified by the month the data were received by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), known as the receipt date; this is not necessarily the same as the reference period (the period for which the VAT return is made).
The diffusion index tracks the growth in turnover and expenditure of firms. It is constructed to lie between negative 1 and 1. For example, if 65% of firms have increasing turnover, 30% have decreasing turnover and 5% turnover remains unchanged, then the diffusion index is 0.35.

209,"Majority self-isolate after contact with a positive coronavirus case
Almost 9 in 10 (88%) of those required to self-isolate after being in contact with a positive coronavirus (COVID-19) case fully followed isolation requirements throughout the full self-isolation period. 
This is according to data collected from the COVID Test and Trace Contacts Insights Survey between 9 and 16 August 2021.
The percentage of case contacts fully adhering to isolation requirements has remained stable since early June.
Just over a third of respondents (37%) reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their well-being and mental health, and 31% reported having lost income because of self-isolation.

The number of deaths from all causes in the UK in the week ending 27 August 2021 was 11,666, 12.0% above the average for the corresponding week in 2015 to 2019. 
Deaths were above the five-year average in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
Of these, 769 deaths were registered involving coronavirus (COVID-19), accounting for around 1 in 15 deaths (6.6%). The number of deaths from COVID-19 was up 17.6% on the previous week (654 deaths), and was the highest since the week ending 26 March 2021. 
COVID-19 deaths increased in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but fell slightly in Wales. UK total deaths include non-residents. 
Using the most up-to-date data, the total number of deaths involving COVID-19 in England and Wales is 144,382 (registrations up to 27 August 2021). Between 13 March 2020 and 27 August 2021, there have been 110,595 excess deaths above the five-year average.

211,"Coronavirus delays death registrations in England and Wales
The number of suicides registered in England and Wales has dropped by 8.2%.
There were 5,224 suicides registered in 2020 compared with 5,691 the previous year.
The decrease in the number of suicides registered in 2020 is likely to be due to registration delays during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and a decrease in male suicide at the start of the pandemic. 
Provisional analysis for the first two quarters of 2021 shows there were 10.4 suicide deaths per 100,000 people in each of the first two quarters of 2021, equivalent to 1,274 registered deaths in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021 and 1,287 registered deaths in Quarter 2 (Apr to Jun) 2021. 
The analysis showed the rate in Quarter 2 2021 is statistically significantly higher than the rate in Quarter 2 2020 (7.0 deaths per 100,000); the latest Quarter 2 2021 rate has returned to previous levels following the disruption to coroner’s inquests in Quarter 2 2020 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
The data reported in this release cannot be used to show the number of suicides with a date of death in 2021. See deaths from suicide that occurred in England and Wales between April and July 2020 for further information on suicide during the coronavirus pandemic.

",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2020registrations,"In 2020, there were 5,224 suicides registered in England and Wales, equivalent to an age-standardised mortality rate of 10.0 deaths per 100,000 people and statistically significantly lower than the 2019 rate of 11.0 deaths per 100,000.
The decrease is likely to be driven by two factors; a decrease in male suicides at the start of the coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic, and delays in death registrations because of the pandemic. 
Around three-quarters of registered suicide deaths in 2020 were for men (3,925 deaths; 75.1%), which follows a consistent trend back to the mid-1990s.
The England and Wales male suicide rate of 15.4 deaths per 100,000 is statistically significantly lower than in 2019 but consistent with rates in earlier years; for females, the rate was 4.9 deaths per 100,000, consistent with the past decade.
Males and females aged 45 to 49 years had the highest age-specific suicide rate (24.1 male and 7.1 female deaths per 100,000). 
For the fifth consecutive year, London has had the lowest suicide rate of any region of England (7.0 deaths per 100,000), while the highest rate in 2020 was in the North East with 13.3 deaths per 100,000.

More than four in five (84%) UK residents arriving into the UK found following overseas coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions difficult or very difficult in July 2021. 
According to the International Passenger Survey, in July 2021 48% of UK residents arriving into the UK said they had found it difficult to follow overseas COVID-19 restrictions, and 36% said they found it very difficult. 
When arriving back into the UK 26% of overseas residents said they understood UK COVID-19 restrictions quite well, and 69% understood them very well.

The number of UK residents arriving back into the UK who have been vaccinated rose between February to July 2021, from 6% to 78%, a trend broadly reflecting the vaccine rollout in the UK over this time period.
Roughly two thirds of all UK (64%) and overseas residents (68%) interviewed felt safe with social distancing during their journey in July 2021, which has remained broadly consistent since April 2021 for UK residents, and since February 2021 for overseas residents.
More than two thirds of both UK and overseas residents arriving in the UK in July 2021 said the wearing of face coverings made them feel safe during their journey.
The proportion of both UK residents and overseas residents in July 2021 who said COVID-19 testing was very important (53% and 61% respectively) remained consistent with June 2021 (52% and 64% respectively), but had fallen compared with May 2021 (64% and 73% respectively).

213,"Vaccine hesitancy among young linked to worry about vaccine and belief it is not needed
The main factors behind coronavirus vaccine hesitancy among young people included a lack of trust in the vaccine, the government and those encouraging vaccine take up; concern about known and unknown side effects (including on fertility); and a belief it was unnecessary for those at low risk of harm from the virus.
In June 2021, a qualitative pilot study was undertaken with 17 previous respondents (aged 16 to 29 years) of the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), who had indicated they were “fairly unlikely” or “very unlikely” to get a coronavirus vaccine. None had received the vaccine at the time of research. 
Changes in coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy among young people appeared related to media influences, experiences of others having the vaccine, and opinions of those in close social networks. 
Attitudes towards vaccine passports were mixed – their use would encourage some to be vaccinated but discourage others. 
The youngest participants were more influenced by negative social media narratives, while female participants were more concerned about fertility-related side effects. 
The findings apply to study participants and should not be generalised to the wider population.

Primary factors for increasing vaccine hesitancy included distrust of vaccine (safety and content); distrust of government and of those encouraging vaccine take up; concern about known and unknown side effects (including on fertility); and belief it was unnecessary for those at low risk of harm from the virus.
Changes in vaccine hesitancy appeared related to media influences, experiences of others having the vaccine, and opinions of those in close social networks; the impact of vaccine passports was mixed and could result in encouraging some participants to be vaccinated but discouraging others completely.
Generally, vaccination in the future was considered by participants, but this was often far in the future because of a wish to know more about long-term side effects, and dependent on more information, research, and medical studies being available.
There were subtle differences between some demographic characteristics; the youngest participants were more influenced by negative social media narratives, female participants were more concerned about fertility related side effects, while Black participants indicated higher levels of generalised distrust.

215,"COVID-19 antibodies among adults remain high 
An estimated  94.1% of the adult population of England, 92.0% in Wales, 90.4% in Northern Ireland and 93.6% in Scotland would have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in the week beginning 9 August 2021. 
The presence of antibodies suggests a person previously had COVID-19 or has been vaccinated.    
Estimates suggest between 90.5% and 92.4% of adults across the UK reported they had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in the week beginning 2 August 2021.   
In some regions and countries, we are starting to see a decline in the percentage of people testing positive for antibodies amongst the oldest age groups, although rates amongst these age groups remain high.
Our analysis defines antibody positivity by a fixed amount of antibodies in the blood. Most older people who are vaccinated will retain higher antibody levels than prior to vaccination, but may have a lower number of antibodies in the blood at the time of testing. Please read our  Antibodies and Immunity blog  for more information. 
The survey does not include people who live in care homes.

220,"COVID-19 reinfections are rare and milder than initial infections
The number of coronavirus (COVID-19) reinfections is low, and there is evidence that reinfections are milder than the first infection. 
The strength of an infection is measured by a cycle threshold (Ct) value. Positive results with a low Ct value (30 or less) indicate episodes of infection with a higher viral load and tests with a high Ct value (more than 30) indicate a lower viral load. 
Between 26 April 2020 and 14 August 2021, the estimated rate for reinfections with a strong positive test (with Ct less than 30) was lower than the rate for all reinfections including those with lower viral load (4.1 per 100,000 participant days at risk compared with 10.9). 
To distinguish reinfection from an ongoing initial infection, the analysis defines a reinfection as: 
 - a new positive test 120 days or more after an initial first positive test which was preceded by at least one negative test
 - a new positive test following four consecutive negative tests regardless of the time since the first positive.
The analysis includes individuals from the community population and excludes those in hospitals, care homes, or other institutional settings in the UK.

Almost 9 in 10 (87%) people would be likely or very likely to have a booster coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine if offered. Younger groups are less likely to accept a vaccine (78% aged 16 to 29 years) than older groups (96% aged 70 years and over).
The percentage of adults who always or often maintain social distancing (46%) fell slightly this week (49% last week). However, the proportion of adults reporting to wear face coverings when outside their home (89%) was similar to last week (90%). 
The proportion meeting up indoors with others outside their household (69%) increased compared with the previous week (64%), as did meeting up outdoors (67% this week, 60% previous week).
In the latest week, 3% of adults said they were self-isolating, a slight decrease from 4% the previous week.
Being in contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19 was the most common reason for self-isolation (37%), followed by being notified by the NHS app (26%) and testing positive for COVID-19 (25%).
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/20august2021,"This week, over the period 11 to 15 August 2021, based on adults in Great Britain:
The proportion of adults reporting to wear face coverings when outside their home (89%) was similar to last week (90%), while the percentage of adults who always or often maintain social distancing (46%) fell slightly this week (49% last week), as did the proportion of adults avoiding physical contact when outside their home (59%) when compared with last week (64%).
A high proportion of adults still felt that measures to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) were either very important or important; such as wearing a face covering (86% this week, 88% last week) and socially distancing from others not in their household (84% this week, 86% last week).
The proportion of adults that reported self-isolating in the last seven days remained relatively stable (3% this week, 4% last week).
The main reasons adults self-isolated in the last seven days were because of being in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 (37%), being notified by the NHS app to self-isolate (26%) and testing positive for COVID-19 (25%).
The proportion of adults meeting up indoors with others outside their household (69%) increased compared with last week (64%), as did the proportion of adults meeting up outdoors (67% this week, 60% last week).
Over a quarter of adults (28% this week, 27% last week) reported they felt it will take more than a year for life to return to normal, this is broadly similar to the proportions since the implementation of step 1 of the roadmap in England; 16% of adults (18% last week) reported they felt it would take six months or less.
Personal well-being measures remained stable compared with last week, with similar levels for the feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile (7.3 this week, 7.4 last week), while all other measures for life satisfaction (7.1), anxiety (3.8) and happiness (7.1) remained unchanged from the previous week.
The proportion of adults that feel very or somewhat worried about the effect of COVID-19 on their life right now fell slightly (46% this week, 49% last week).
Almost 9 in 10 (87%) people would be likely or very likely to have a booster COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Younger groups are less likely to accept a booster COVID-19 vaccine (78% for those aged 16 to 29 years) compared with older groups (96% for those aged 70 years and over).

225,"COVID-19 antibodies continue to rise along with vaccinations
An estimated 94.2% of the adult population of England, 93.2% in Wales, 89.1% in Northern Ireland and 93.5% in Scotland would have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in the week beginning 26 July 2021.
The presence of antibodies suggests a person previously had COVID-19 or has been vaccinated. 
Estimates suggest an increase in the percentage of adults across the UK who reported they had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, from 90.1% to 92.1% of adults across the UK. 
The estimated percentage of adults who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 continued to increase, ranging across the UK, from 74.8% in Northern Ireland to 80.7% in England in the week beginning 26 July 2021.
Across the four UK countries, the estimated percentage of adults aged 25 to 34 years who have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 82.3% to 90.1% – this has increased sharply since the end of May. A similar increase can be seen for those aged 16 to 24 years across the UK since June, with between 51.3% and 56.6% reporting having had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in the week beginning 26 July 2021.
The percentage of adults testing positive for antibodies varies by age group between the four nations of the UK. This could be explained by different historical trends in COVID-19 infection rates and the approaches to vaccine distribution in different nations.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveyantibodyandvaccinationdatafortheuk/19august2021,"In England, it is estimated that over 9 in 10 adults, or 94.2% of the adult population (95% credible interval: 93.2% to 95.1%) would have tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the specific virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19), on a blood test in the week beginning 26 July 2021, suggesting they had the infection in the past or have been vaccinated.
In Wales, it is estimated that over 9 in 10 adults, or 93.2% of the adult population (95% credible interval: 91.8% to 94.5%) would have tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 on a blood test in the week beginning 26 July 2021, suggesting they had the infection in the past or have been vaccinated.
In Northern Ireland, it is estimated that around 9 in 10 adults, or 89.1% of the adult population (95% credible interval: 85.0% to 92.0%) would have tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 on a blood test in the week beginning 26 July 2021, suggesting they had the infection in the past or have been vaccinated.
In Scotland, it is estimated that over 9 in 10 adults, or 93.5% of the adult population (95% credible interval: 92.2% to 94.6%) would have tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 on a blood test in the week beginning 26 July 2021, suggesting they had the infection in the past or have been vaccinated.
Across all four countries of the UK, there is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies but the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination.

226,"Online job adverts remained higher than their February 2020 average
The total volume of UK online job adverts on 13 August 2021 was 128% higher than their February 2020 average, similar to 6 August 2021.
According to data from Adzuna, the “transport/logistics/warehouse” job advert category remains the category with the highest level of job adverts relative to its pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic level, at 335% of its February 2020 average.

Users should note that week-on-week changes in online job advert volumes are outlined as percentages, rather than as percentage point changes. Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the charts and accompanying dataset.

On 13 August 2021, 14 out of 28 job advert categories saw a weekly decrease, seven were unchanged and the remaining seven increased when compared with the previous week. The largest weekly decrease in online job adverts was in the “charity/voluntary” and “education” categories, which both fell by 7%. The largest weekly increase was “domestic help”, which rose by 4%.
The categories that remain the furthest level below their pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels are “legal” and “energy/oil and gas”, which are 73% and 82% of their February 2020 average level, respectively. In total, there are only six categories that remain below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels.

Results presented in this bulletin are experimental and may be subject to revision. 
We are re-introducing the shipping data last released in the bulletin published on 17 June 2021. A changeover in the systems used to collect these data has introduced a level shift in the time series from 14 June 2021 onwards and users should not make comparisons between data before and after this date. However, we feel that re-introducing the publication of these data will assist users in understanding the latest shipping movements. The data produced prior to the change, for 1 April 2019 to 13 June 2021, can still be compared within that period.
A full methodological review of our current method of data collection is underway and data may be subject to revision once this is complete. The accompanying dataset has been updated back to 14 June 2021 and will continue to be updated using the current method until the review is complete.

These data series are experimental faster indicators for estimating UK spending on credit and debit cards. They track the daily CHAPS payments made by credit and debit card payment processors to around 100 major UK retail corporates. These payments are the proceeds of recent credit and debit card transactions made by customers at their stores, both via physical and via online platforms. More information on the indicator is provided in the accompanying methodology article.  
Companies are allocated to one of four categories based on their primary business:   
""staples"" refers to companies that sell essential goods that households need to purchase, such as food and utilities  
""work-related"" refers to companies providing public transport or selling petrol  
""delayable"" refers to companies selling goods whose purchase could be delayed, such as clothing or furnishings  
""social"" refers to spending on travel and eating out
Users should note the daily payment data is the sum of card transactions processed up to the previous working day, so there is a slight time lag when compared with real-life events on the chart.
The vertical lines indicate key events. In order, the events are: first national lockdown begins; some non-essential shops allowed to reopen; regional restrictions begin in England; Christmas period; lockdowns announced in England and Scotland; reopening of non-essential shops, and outdoor pubs and restaurants in England; further easing of lockdown restrictions, including re-opening of indoor pubs and restaurants in England; most legal restrictions to control COVID-19 lifted in England. 
Percentage point difference is derived from current week and previous week index before rounding.
Figure 3 shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors, ""merchant acquirers"". 
In the week to 12 August 2021, the CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases in aggregate decreased by 5 percentage points from the previous week to 94% of its February 2020 average level. This was driven by decreases in all spending categories; ""social"" and ""staple"" both fell by 7 percentage points, ""work-related"" fell by 4 percentage points and ""delayable"" fell by 3 percentage points.
In the latest week, ""work-related"" and ""staple"" spending remained above their February 2020 average levels, at 112% and 101%, respectively. Conversely, ""social"" and ""delayable"" spending were at 88% and 89% of their February 2020 average levels.
Initial results from Wave 37 of the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) cover the reference period 26 July to 8 August 2021, with a response rate of 19.9% (7,645 responses). The survey was live for the period 9 to 17 August 2021.
Please note, as part of our regular and ongoing quality assessment of our methods, we will be introducing improved methods used to weight smaller businesses within the BICS sample where we use employment and turnover to do so. We plan to introduce these new methods in the publication of 26 August 2021. This may lead to some revisions in estimates.
Initial weighted results, Wave 37 of Office for National Statistics' (ONS') Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS).
A detailed description of the weighting methodology and the weights used for each variable is available in Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS).
Data are plotted in the middle of the two-week period of each wave.
Notes
These figures are experimental estimates of online job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, by category, by UK country and English region. The number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour. The Adzuna categories used do not correspond to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) Vacancy Survey.
Further category breakdowns are included in the online job advert estimates dataset and more details on the methodology can be found in Using Adzuna data to derive an indicator of weekly vacancies.
Users should note that week-on-week changes in online job advert volumes are outlined as percentages, rather than as percentage point changes. Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the charts and accompanying dataset.

According to Adzuna, on 13 August 2021, the total volume of online job adverts in the UK was broadly similar to the previous week (6 August 2021).
Of the 28 categories, 14 saw a weekly decrease in the number of online job adverts, 7 were unchanged, while the remaining 7 increased when compared with the previous week. The largest weekly decreases were in ""charity/voluntary"" and ""education"" which both fell by 7%. The total volume of online job adverts has fallen by 12% in the ""education"" category since the week ending 23 July 2021. The largest weekly increase was in ""domestic help"" which rose by 4%.
The total volume of online job adverts remained substantially above pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic volume, at 128% of its February 2020 average level. The ""transport/logistics/warehouse"" category remains the category with the highest level of job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic level, at 335% of its February 2020 average level.
There are only six categories that are below pre-pandemic levels. The lowest of these are ""legal"" and ""energy/oil and gas"" which are 73% and 82% of their February 2020 average level, respectively.
.XLSX
On 13 August 2021, the volume of online job adverts had decreased or remained the same across nearly all UK countries and English regions when compared with the previous week (6 August 2021). The exceptions being in Northern Ireland and North East England where they rose by 4% and 2% respectively.  
In the latest week, volumes of online job adverts remained above their February 2020 average levels in all UK countries and English regions. The highest of these were in North East England, Northern Ireland and East Midlands at 181%, 161% and 160% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively. The North East has been the region with the highest number of online job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic levels since 9 April 2021.
Meanwhile, relative to February 2020 average levels, the volume of online job adverts on 13 August 2021 remained lowest in London, where the corresponding figure was 104%, unchanged from last week.
These data are daily flight figures from the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL). Daily flight numbers for the UK alongside other countries are available in EUROCONTROL's dashboard. EUROCONTROL is a pan-European, civil-military organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation. Its Aviation Intelligence and Performance Review Unit provides independent collection and validation of air navigation services performance-related data and intelligence gathering.
These flights data include international arrivals and departures to and from the UK (including Crown Dependencies) and domestic UK flights, but exclude overflights (flights that pass over UK territory). They capture all flight movements that operate under Instrumental Flight Rules (IFR), where the pilot uses instruments in the flight deck to control, guide and adjust the plane. This includes commercial flights carrying passengers and cargo as well as non-commercial flights such as private and military flights.
Data from EUROCONTROL do not include information on the volume of passengers or cargo carried on UK flights. Especially in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, flights might not be operating at full capacity and therefore trends in passengers and cargo will differ from trends in flights presented here.

The fall in February 2020 coincides with Storm Ciara.
The falls in December and January coincide with Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.
In the week ending 15 August 2021, the seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,142, broadly similar to the previous week (3,111). It is, however, the highest weekly average number of UK flights seen since the week ending 22 March 2020 (the day before the first national lockdown was implemented in the UK).
The seven-day average number of UK daily flights has now increased by 120% from the week ending 23 May 2021, the week that international travel was allowed to restart and the UK government implemented the travel traffic light system (17 May 2021).
The average number of UK daily flights in the latest week was at 48% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019, broadly unchanged from the previous week. In the latest week, compared with the equivalent week of 2020 (when UK travel corridors were still in place), the seven-day average number of daily flights was at 115% of its 2020 level.
The full data time series available for UK flights can be found in the accompanying dataset, which contains daily flight numbers and the rolling seven-day averages.
National footfall figures are supplied by Springboard, a provider of data on customer activity. They measure the following for overall UK retail footfall, as well as by high street, retail park, and shopping centre categories:

According to Springboard, in the week to 14 August 2021, the volume of overall retail footfall in the UK increased slightly by 2% from the previous week (week to 7 August 2021). This continues the gradual upward trend since the lifting of most legal restrictions in England on 19 July 2021 and is the sixth consecutive weekly rise in overall retail.
The latest week's increase was driven by a week-on-week rise of 3% in footfall on high streets. In comparison, footfall at both shopping centres and retail parks was broadly unchanged compared with the previous week.
In the latest week to 14 August 2021, overall retail footfall was at 82% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. Comparing retail locations, footfall at retail parks remained the strongest relative to pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels, at 98% of its equivalent 2019 level. Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for high streets and shopping centres were 78% and 76%, respectively. Throughout most of the pandemic, footfall at retail parks has consistently been strongest when compared with other retail locations, relative to their 2019 levels.

According to Springboard, in the week to 14 August 2021, retail footfall saw week-on-week percentage increases in 4 of the 10 UK countries and English regions, the largest of which were in Northern Ireland and Wales, which saw rises of 4% and 3% respectively over the week. The remaining 6 of the 10 countries and English regions remained broadly unchanged from the previous week.
In the same week, relative to the levels seen in the equivalent week of 2019, retail footfall continued to be strongest in the South West of England at 88%, followed by the North and Yorkshire, and Wales both at 87%. In contrast, retail footfall was weakest in Scotland at 77% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019, followed by Greater London and Northern Ireland, both of which were at 80%.
OpenTable is a provider of data for online restaurant reservations, with daily data for the UK, London and Manchester being publicly available in its The state of the industry dashboard. These data show the impact of recent events and restrictions on the hospitality industry using a sample of restaurants on the OpenTable network across all channels, that is, online reservations, phone reservations and walk-ins.

According to OpenTable, in the week to 16 August 2021, the seven-day average estimate of UK seated diners increased by 5 percentage points, when compared with the previous week, to 133% of its level in the equivalent week of 2019. This continues the broadly upward trend in recent weeks following the lifting of most legal restrictions in England on 19 July 2021, after which the seven-day average estimate of UK seated diners has increased by 17 percentage points.
In the latest week, the seven-day average estimate of seated diners in Manchester substantially increased by 11 percentage points to 143% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. During the same period, the equivalent figure for London was 81%, an increase of 5 percentage points from the previous week. Both of these areas have seen notable increases since the 19 July 2021, after the easing of most lockdown restrictions in England. Over this period, Manchester has seen a substantial increase of 41 percentage points, whereas London has seen an increase of 12 percentage points.
The UK seven-day average estimate of seated diners has remained above the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019 since the week ending 17 May 2021 (following the reopening of indoor hospitality in England on 17 May 2021). Since the week ending 26 April 2021 to the latest week, seated diner estimates in Manchester have consistently remained above the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. Over the same period in London, however, this has only occurred on one occasion, which was during the week to 31 May 2021, a week that included the second May bank holiday.
This section includes some provisional results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) covering the period 11 to 15 August 2021. The survey went out to 4,989 adults in Great Britain and had a response rate of 63% (3,130 responses). Further information to help understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain will be available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain, due to be published on 20 August 2021.
In the period 11 to 15 August 2021, the proportion of working adults in Great Britain who in the past seven days:
travelled to work (either exclusively or in combination with working from home) was broadly similar to the previous week at 60%
worked exclusively from home was broadly similar to the previous week at 18%
neither travelled to work nor worked from home was unchanged from the previous week at 22%
Of the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for food and medicine increased slightly by 2 percentage points from the previous week to 84%.
The proportion of these adults who shopped for things other than food and medicine in the last seven days increased by 3 percentage points from the previous week to 47%.
Of the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so and wore a face covering was broadly similar to the previous week at 89%. Further breakdowns such as the situation when a face covering was worn (for example, while shopping) and by country, will be available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain to be published on 20 August 2021.
According to Department for Transport (DfT) non-seasonally adjusted road traffic data, the volume of all motor vehicle traffic on Monday 16 August 2021 was at 99% of the level seen on the Monday of the first week in February 2020, broadly similar to the previous five weeks.
Compared with the previous week (Monday 9 August 2021), traffic volume was broadly similar for light commercial vehicle, heavy goods vehicle and car vehicle traffic, at 109%, 104% and 96% of the level seen in the first week of February 2020, respectively.
The blue shaded areas refer to periods when restrictions across the UK were in effect. In order, these were: first national lockdown in the UK (23 March 2020) to easing of restrictions with non-essential shops reopening in England (15 June 2020); second lockdown in England (5 November 2020) to lockdown being replaced with three-tier system in England (2 December 2020); third lockdown announced in Scotland and England (4 January 2021) to ""stay at home"" restrictions ending in England (29 March 2021).
Road traffic data for Thursday 12 August are not available at time of publishing, because of missing data in the underlying dataset.

Incorporations are when a company is added to the Companies House register of limited companies. This can also include where an existing business applies to become a limited company, where it was not one before.   
A voluntary dissolution application is when a company applies to begin dissolution proceedings. As such, they effectively chose to be removed from the Companies House register. For a company to be eligible to voluntarily dissolve, it should not have completed any trading activity for a period of three months.

227,"UK COVID-19 deaths continue to rise
The number of deaths from all causes in the UK in the week ending 6 August 2021 was 11,589, 12.4% above the average for the corresponding week in 2015 to 2019. 
Deaths were above the five-year average in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
Of these, 609 deaths were registered involving coronavirus (COVID-19), accounting for around 1 in 19 deaths (5.3%). This is a 30.1% increase on the previous week.

228,"Infections continued to be high in England and Northern Ireland 
Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continued to be high in England and Northern Ireland in the latest week, while the trend is uncertain in Wales. Infections have decreased in Scotland. 
The estimated percentage of the community population (those not in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings) that had COVID-19 in the latest week was: 
 - 1.33% (1 in 75 people) in England in the week ending 6 August 2021
 - 0.46% (1 in 220 people) in Wales in the week ending 7 August 2021
 - 1.88% (1 in 55 people) in Northern Ireland in the week ending 7 August 2021
 - 0.53% (1 in 190 people) in Scotland in the week ending 7 August 2021
Across England, infections increased for those between school Year 12 and those aged 24 years, while the trend is uncertain for all other age groups. 
Infections have also decreased in the North East, North West, West Midlands and London. In other regions, the trend is uncertain in the latest week. 
Although the percentage of people in England testing positive for coronavirus continued to be high in the latest week, our modelled estimates suggest an overall decrease in people testing positive over the past two weeks.

229,"More adults are now meeting up indoors  
Almost two thirds (64%) of adults met up indoors with someone not in their household in the past seven days. This figure is up from 62% last week, continuing a trend seen since coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were removed in England on 19 July 2021. Between 14 and 18 July 2021, just under half (47%) of adults reported meeting up indoors.
In the latest week (4 to 8 August 2021), slightly fewer adults reported meeting outdoors than indoors. The shift occurred as the percentage of people meeting outdoors dropped to 60%. 
Over a quarter of adults (27%) reported that they felt it will take more than a year for life to return to normal, down from 32% three weeks ago (14 to 18 July 2021). 
Strong support remains for measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. Around 9 in 10 (88%) adults said it was important or very important to wear face coverings while shopping, while 86% felt that socially distancing from those not in their household was important or very important.

A high proportion of adults felt that measures to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) were either very important or important, such as wearing a face covering while shopping (88% this week, 89% last week) and socially distancing from others not in their household (86% this week, 89% last week).
The proportion of adults that reported self-isolating in the last seven days remained stable (4% this week and last week).
The main reasons adults self-isolated in the last seven days continued to be because of being in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 (38%) or being notified by the NHS app to self-isolate (27%).
The proportion of adults meeting up indoors with someone not in their household in the past seven days increased slightly this week (64% this week, 62% last week) continuing an increase seen since the removal of legal restrictions as part of step 4 of the roadmap in England on 19 July (47% in the period 14 to 18 July).

230,"Most parents would be likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for their child 
Around 86% of parents with children aged under 16 years would definitely or probably say yes to them having a COVID-19 vaccine. 
Among secondary school parents, 54% would definitely want their child to be vaccinated against COVID-19 while 32% were unsure but would probably say yes. 
Around 40% of primary school parents say they would definitely want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine if offered, while 46% were unsure but would probably say yes. 
Just 6% of secondary school parents and 3% of primary school parents would definitely not want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine. 
Analysis was carried out on 1,728 responses from parents with children under the age of 16 years in 14 local authority areas in England between 21 May and 22 June 2021. 
The latest COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey (Round 6) showed 0.27% of primary school pupils and 0.42% of secondary school pupils, along with 0.27% of secondary school staff had COVID-19 on the day of testing between 14 June and 6 July 2021. This is based on tests from 141 schools, of which 108 (77%) returned no positive cases.

Prevalence of infection among pupils sampled in school was consistently lower than prevalence of infection among children in the wider community across all time periods; these findings support the hypothesis that over the school year ""school gate"" measures have reduced the risk of infection in school and the rapid asymptomatic testing programme may have enhanced this by keeping a higher proportion of infected pupils out of school in the summer term.
The central estimates seen for seroconversion between Rounds 5 and 6 are the lowest seen at any point in the academic year; for primary school staff the seroconversion rate between Rounds 5 and 6 was 0.8 per 1,000 person-weeks, for secondary school staff, the seroconversion rate was 1.9 per 1,000 person-weeks.
In June 2021, 25.16% of primary school staff (95% confidence intervals: 19.73% to 31.22%) and 23.36% of secondary school staff (95% confidence intervals: 20.66% to 26.22%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; this difference is not statistically significant. 
By the end of June 2021, 92.93% of staff had received at least one dose and 70.47% had received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccination.
40% of primary school parents and 54% of secondary school parents would definitely want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine if offered; only 3% of primary school parents and 6% of secondary school parents would definitely not want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine, there has been no significant change in opinion since the previous questionnaire reported at Round 5.

232,"Vaccine hesitancy falling across Great Britain
Adults from all English regions, Scotland and Wales became less likely to report coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy during the first half of 2021. 
New analysis compares hesitancy in the period 7 January to 28 March with that seen in the period 28 April to 18 July 2021. The latest national estimates are available in the bulletin. 
The sharpest falls tended to be in areas with the highest initial vaccine hesitancy rates such as London (11% to 7%), including Inner London East (13% to 7%), Outer London West and North West (12% to 7%); and Wales (9% to 4%), including West Wales and The Valleys (11% to 5%). 
As well as having among the highest hesitancy rates, London appears to be behind other regions on vaccine uptake. At the end of June 2021, one in nine (11%) adults aged 50 years and over in London had not received a coronavirus vaccine, twice the rate of any other English region.

9 August 2021
People from all parts of Great Britain became less likely to report vaccine hesitancy during the first half of 2021. 
New analysis compares hesitancy towards the coronavirus vaccine in the period 7 January to 28 March with that seen in the period 28 April to 18 July 2021. 
The sharpest decline in hesitancy was in Wales (where the rate decreased from 9% in January to March to 4% in April to July 2021), followed by London (11% to 7%), Yorkshire and The Humber (8% to 4%) and the North East (7% to 3%). 
Despite the fall, Londoners remained the most vaccine hesitant among the regions and countries of Great Britain. 
""Vaccine hesitancy"" refers to adults who: 
Regional rates of vaccine hesitancy among people who say they are in bad health in general were lower or similar to those reporting good health in April to July, reversing the trend seen in January to March 2021. 
In the first three months of 2021, the highest levels of vaccine hesitancy among those in bad health were reported in Yorkshire and The Humber (15%), London (13%) and West Midlands (12%). 
Hesitancy among those in bad health had fallen sharply in all three regions by April to July 2021, and now appear lower than people reporting good health. 
There are several possible reasons for this decline. Some people in poor health may have been hesitant initially because of pre-existing medical conditions or concerns about side-effects. 
The widespread fall in hesitancy, regardless of self-reported health, coincides with growing evidence that vaccines are effective in preventing hospitalisation from COVID-19, as well as changes to guidance for those who are double-vaccinated. Fully vaccinated adults are now able to return from amber list countries without quarantining, and by 16 August they will no longer need to self-isolate when identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19. 
Our analysis hasn’t tested whether falls in hesitancy are driven by bad health or a combination of factors. 
Data on coronavirus vaccine hesitancy by self-reported health (XLSX, 22KB)
At a sub-regional level, most areas have seen a fall in vaccine hesitancy so far in 2021. 
Areas that recorded the highest hesitancy rates during January to March had seen a reduction by April to July, such as Inner London East (13% to 7%), Outer London West and North West (12% to 7%), and West Wales and The Valleys (11% to 5%). 
However, there remains some local variation, with hesitancy rates remaining as high as 10% in Outer London East and North East, compared with 2% in parts of Scotland, Cheshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. 
Areas in the map are International Territorial Level (ITL) 2, more information about geographic classification is available in the data tables. 
Data on coronavirus vaccine hesitancy in ITL2 areas (XLSX, 23KB)
In line with trends observed across Great Britain as a whole, young adults, those of Black or Black British ethnicity, and the unemployed are generally the most hesitant towards vaccines in all English regions, Scotland and Wales. 
Rates of hesitancy among these groups tended to be highest in London and the Midlands in April to July 2021, despite falling compared with earlier in the year. 
Nearly one in six (15%) young adults (16 to 29-year-olds) in the West Midlands reported vaccine hesitancy in the latest period. 
The West Midlands also had a relatively high proportion of the unemployed saying they were hesitant towards coronavirus vaccines (19%), as did London (17%). 
In the East Midlands, one in three (34%) Black or Black British adults reported vaccine hesitancy. 
Among English regions, London and the West Midlands recorded high rates of hesitancy among adults living in deprived areas (both 12%). 
Data on coronavirus vaccine hesitancy by selected personal characteristics (XLSX, 20KB)
Vaccine hesitancy rates were relatively high in London among certain groups of adults. 
This includes one in nine (11%) people with no qualifications in London reporting vaccine hesitancy in April to July, among the highest in Great Britain and little changed since January to March 2021 (10%). 
London is also among the most hesitant for renters (10%), and those who are unable to afford an unexpected, but necessary, expense of £850 (13%). 
Meanwhile, 1 in 10 (10%) adults living in London households of three or more people remain hesitant. However, only 4% of those who care for someone in their own home in London reported hesitancy in April to July 2021. 
As of 19 July, all adults aged 18 years and over in the UK had been offered at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. 
The latest UK-wide data (up to 1 August 2021) show that 88.6% of the adult population has received one dose of a vaccine, with 72.7% double-vaccinated. Numbers for the four UK nations are available on the GOV.UK coronavirus dashboard. 
Estimates of vaccine uptake among those aged 50 years and over are available for English regions in Public Health England’s COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring for England (CHIME) tool. 
The most recent data, up to the end of June 2021, show that one in nine (11%) adults aged 50 years and over in London have not received a coronavirus vaccine, twice the rate of any other English region. 
The figures cover residents in England who could be linked to the 2011 Census and General Practice (GP) data. They should not be used to represent the total number of vaccinations, and may also differ from the administrative data on vaccinations published by NHS England weekly. 
Data on adults aged 50 years and over that have not received a coronavirus vaccine (XLSX, 18KB)
Among ethnic groups, the highest rate of not receiving a vaccine was in London for Black Caribbean adults (32%) and West Midlands for those of Black African ethnicity (30%). 
Those who have never worked and are long-term unemployed were more likely to have not had a vaccine than those in employment. The highest rate of non-vaccination was in London (21%). 
Just as rates of vaccine hesitancy increase with levels of deprivation, the likelihood of not having a vaccine also rises in more deprived areas across all English regions.

The number of UK residents arriving back into the UK who have been vaccinated rose between February and June 2021, from 6% to 62%, a trend broadly reflecting the vaccine rollout in the UK over this time period.
Roughly two-thirds of all UK (66%) and overseas residents (69%) interviewed felt safe with social distancing during their journey in June 2021, which has remained broadly consistent since February 2021. 
Most UK and overseas residents arriving in the UK said the wearing of face coverings made them feel safe during their journey with overseas residents slightly more likely than UK residents to say that wearing face coverings made them feel safe (75% and 69% respectively), although as these are unweighted figures this cannot be called a statistically significant difference.
The proportion of both UK residents and overseas residents in June 2021 (52% and 64% respectively) who said coronavirus (COVID-19) testing was very important fell from the corresponding figures in May 2021 (64% and 73% respectively).
Most UK residents arriving in the UK found following overseas COVID-19 restrictions either difficult, or very difficult (80% in June 2021), but conversely most overseas residents said that they understood UK COVID-19 restrictions either quite well, or very well.
Despite understanding UK COVID-19 restrictions quite well or very well; most overseas residents said between February and June 2021 that they were either not at all confident, or not very confident in accessing information about UK COVID-19 restrictions.

Older UK residents interviewed arriving into the UK were more likely to have been vaccinated than younger UK residents. Our findings (Figure 1) align with the progress of the vaccine rollout in the UK. UK residents in the older age groups were more likely to have received their vaccine earlier in the period, February to June 2021, than those in the younger age groups. In May and June 2021, as the vaccine rollout was extended and offered to younger age groups, the proportion of UK residents vaccinated in the younger age groups increased, although the proportions remained lower in these age groups compared with older travellers. In June 2021, 62% of UK residents and 62% of overseas residents arriving into the UK had had at least one dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. Of those surveyed, the trend in the vaccination status of overseas residents was similar to the trend for UK residents.
The majority of UK residents (66%) and overseas residents (69%) interviewed arriving into the UK in June, felt safe because of social distancing during their journey. While there was a rise in the proportion of UK residents who said they felt safe between March and April 2021, proportions remained largely consistent across the period for overseas residents (Figure 2).
Most UK and overseas residents interviewed said that the wearing of face coverings made them feel safe during their journey into the UK. This is a trend that remained stable during the period between February and June 2021. Slightly more overseas residents than UK residents (6 percentage points) said that the wearing of face coverings made them feel safe (75% and 69% in June 2021 respectively) (Figure 3).
The majority of travellers interviewed (72% of UK residents and 71% of overseas residents in June 2021), said that availability of hand sanitiser during their journey made them feel safe. This trend has remained consistent amongst UK residents over the period, while there has been a slight decline, since February, in the proportion of overseas residents who said that the availability of hand sanitiser made them feel safe. 
In June 2021, 52% of UK residents and 64% of overseas residents arriving into the UK thought a coronavirus (COVID-19) test was very important for safety (Figure 4). Amongst both groups there has been a decline in this opinion since February 2021, particularly between May and June 2021. However, the increase in the proportion who said that testing was “quite important”, means that overall COVID-19 testing remains “important” for the majority of travellers.
In June 2021, the proportions of both UK residents and overseas residents who thought COVID-19 testing was very important for safety was less than the proportions of those who said that they felt safe on their journey because of social distancing, the wearing of face coverings, and the availability of hand sanitiser. This is the first month this has occurred.
The majority of UK residents interviewed, found it either difficult (47%) or very difficult (33%) to follow overseas coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions (June 2021); this has remained consistent since February 2021 (Figure 5).
Conversely, the majority of overseas residents interviewed arriving into the UK said they understood UK COVID-19 restrictions either quite well or very well, a trend that has remained consistent since February 2021 (Figure 6). In June 2021 26% of overseas residents said that they understood UK restrictions quite well, and 69% understood them very well. Very few said they did not understand restrictions very well (2%) or did not understand them at all (0%).
Although overseas residents interviewed were more likely to say they understood UK COVID-19 restrictions very well, in June 2021 70% of overseas residents said that they were not at all confident accessing information about the UK’s COVID-19 restrictions. This proportion has remained consistently above 65% since February 2021 (Figure 7). In June 2021, 70% said they were not at all confident accessing this information with an additional 26% being not very confident. Only 2% felt somewhat confident or very confident accessing information about the UK’s COVID-19 restrictions. 
International Passenger Survey findings on COVID-19 Dataset | Released 9 August 2021 Monthly figures about attitudes of United Kingdom (UK) and overseas residents arriving into the UK, towards social distancing, mask wearing, hand sanitiser availability and COVID-19 restrictions and the proportion of travellers who have received at least one vaccine dose, using unweighted results from the International Passenger Survey for the period covering February to June 2021 (experimental statistics).

A person who, being permanently resident in a country outside the UK, visits the UK for a period of less than 12 months. UK citizens resident overseas for 12 months or more coming home on leave are included in this category. Visits abroad are visits for a period of less than 12 months by people permanently resident in the UK (who may be of foreign nationality).
A new traffic light system has been in place since 17 May 2021, banding countries into ""green"", ""amber"" and ""red"" lists. It is important to note that the categorisation of countries has changed throughout the period between February and June 2021 reported in this data, and this should be considered when analysing the results of the data on understanding and accessing information on restrictions.
The rollout of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine across the UK, phase one of which began in December 2020, with the full vaccine delivery plan available.
This bulletin uses data from the International Passenger Survey (IPS). IPS data is regularly released in the Travel and Tourism series. The data presented in this bulletin are based on new questions which have been added to the IPS to collect data measuring the attitudes towards and experiences of coronavirus (COVID-19) and associated restrictions, among travellers arriving into the UK. Detailed information on the IPS methodology is available. 
All COVID-19 questions were asked of all respondents arriving into the UK with the following exceptions:
The following two questions are only asked to overseas residents:
""How well do you understand the Coronavirus (COVID-19) regulations that will apply to you during your visit to the UK?""
""How confident are you that you know how to access official information on Coronavirus (COVID-19) regulations for the UK?""
The following question is only asked to UK residents:
Totals shown, and those used to calculate percentages, include all overseas arrivals (international visitors to the UK and UK residents arriving back into the UK). Questions were not asked of travellers leaving the UK. Residents of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man have been counted as overseas residents (as have all Crown dependencies). Sea and tunnel data are excluded as the numbers are too small; because of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions it wasn't possible to interview on board Dover ferries or the Eurotunnel. Overall, sea and tunnel numbers are much lower than pre-COVID and show a 75% drop in passengers. 
The sample used for both UK and overseas residents across the study (February to June 2021) totals 17,720. Individual breakdowns by residency and month cannot be supplied because of disclosure control of low counts. Age groupings were based on self-reported data which is not verified.
Around 90% of international traffic into and out of the UK is subject to IPS sampling. COVID-19 questions were not asked if a person under 16 years was sampled unless permission from their parent or guardian was obtained. Due to social distancing guidelines, interviewers must maintain a two meter distance from respondents, which presents challenges in terms of obtaining response. It is much more difficult to present the tablet to the respondent to select a response at this distance.
It is very difficult to predict the numbers of interviews that can be expected to be achieved in the current operating circumstances, where interviews are being conducted under social distancing and passenger flow is likely to be very low. We have attempted to offset the effects of the low numbers of anticipated travellers by reducing sampling intervals (so a higher proportion are selected for interview). 
In order to provide the timeliest insights, this bulletin contains unweighted data based on the actual numbers of people interviewed, meaning no account is taken of the different numbers of travellers represented by each respondent to the survey. Trends observed in unweighted data over time may be because of changes in the composition of survey respondents, rather than trends for the whole travelling population. Analysis comparing the weighted and unweighted data for February and March 2021 found little difference in trends, suggesting this unweighted data can be considered as broadly indicative.
This also means no confidence intervals are provided and therefore caution must be taken when comparing figures and conclusions drawn from this sample time series, comparison should not be extended to all travellers travelling during this period. Totals should also not be compared with the weighted totals in the Travel and Tourism bulletins.
The following quality caveats associated with using unweighted data should be considered.
The IPS sample is drawn to be representative by quarter and therefore may not be evenly distributed across each month in terms of which traffic is sampled. For example, this could mean that by chance in one month more boats were sampled than other months simply because of shift allocation. A further example could be that one month simply happened to have more weekend shifts than weekday shifts. 
Potential differences in mode of transport and the sample sizes between those modes from month to month could cause what look like changes in the data each month. However, it could just be that the composition of the sample has changed from month to month.
Some routes are overrepresented in the data because of the sample design, for example air travel to Heathrow. Potential policy changes that only affect one route or mode of transport could have an unrepresentative effect on the sample shown. 
Due to the unweighted data providing smaller samples for each month, comparisons in this bulletin looking for reasons for differences between the months are based on observations in the data and not on statistically significant differences. These are experimental statistics which are being published to involve users and stakeholders at an early stage in assessing their suitability and quality.
This release will continue to be updated on a monthly basis; therefore, in September we will publish data up to July 2021. We are looking for feedback on this release from readers to incorporate into future releases. Please use the contact details listed to provide feedback.

234,"Infections decrease in England, Wales and Scotland
Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases decreased in England, Wales and Scotland but continued to increase in Northern Ireland in the week ending 31 July 2021. 
The estimated percentage of the community population (those not in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings) that had COVID-19 was:
 - 1.32% (1 in 75 people) in England, down from 1.57% (1 in 65 people) last week
 - 0.43% (1 in 230 people) in Wales, down from 0.62% (1 in 160 people) last week
 - 1.87% (1 in 55 people) in Northern Ireland, up from 1.48% (1 in 65 people) last week
 - 0.82% (1 in 120 people) in Scotland, down from 0.94% (1 in 110 people) last week
Across England, infections decreased for those between School Year 12 and those aged 49 years and those aged 70 years and over, while the trend is uncertain for all other age groups.
Infections have also decreased in the North West, East Midlands, West Midlands, London and the South East, while the trend is uncertain for all other regions.

The proportion of adults reporting to wear face coverings when outside their home (92%) fell this week when compared with last week (95%), as did the percentage of adults who always or often maintain social distancing (53%) when compared with last week (61%).
A high proportion of adults felt that compliance measures to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) were either very important or important; such as wearing a face covering while shopping (91% this week, 89% last week) and socially distancing from others not in their household (87% this week, 88% last week).
The proportion of adults that reported self-isolating in the last seven days fell to 4% (from 6% last week), which may be a result of the possible signs of a slowdown in infection rates in England, as mentioned in the Coronavirus Infection Survey UK: 30 July 2021. 
The main reason adults self-isolated in the last seven days continued to be because of being in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 (53% compared with 42% last week). 
The second most common reason for self-isolating in the last seven days was the new response option of being notified by the NHS app (26%).
More than 6 in 10 (62%) adults said they met up indoors with someone not in their household in the past seven days, having increased from 55% last week and 20% in the week ending 6 May 2021 before indoor restrictions eased as part of step 3 of the roadmap in England.
Adults meeting up outdoors with someone not in their household in the past seven days decreased slightly from 68% last week to 65%; this was at 20% in the week ending 7 March 2021 before outdoor activity restrictions eased as part of step 1 of the roadmap.
Almost 3 in 10 adults (28% this week, 33% last week) reported they felt it will take more than a year for life to return to normal, with 17% reporting six months or less.
Personal well-being measures remained fairly stable this week compared with last week, with similar levels for happiness (7.1 this week, 7.2 last week), anxiety (3.9 this week, 3.8 last week), while the feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile (7.3) and life satisfaction (7.0) were unchanged from last week.
Positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccine remained high at 96% (same as last week), while 89% of adults said they were either very or fairly likely to have a vaccine booster jab for COVID-19 if offered to them.
Those in older age groups were more likely to accept an offer for a booster jab, with 83% of those aged 16 to 29 years being very or fairly likely to accept a booster jab compared with 98% of those aged 70 years and over.

236,"9 out of 10 adults tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies
Across all four countries of the UK, 9 out of 10 adults would have tested positive for antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 in the week beginning 12 July 2021. 
There is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies. In England, an estimated 93.6% of the adult population tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the week beginning 12 July 2021, suggesting they had the infection in the past or have been vaccinated. In Wales, the estimated percentage was 93.2%, in Northern Ireland 90.7%, and in Scotland 92.5%. We provide 95% credible intervals in the main bulletin to indicate the uncertainty of each estimate.

Use your postcode to see the number of excess deaths each month in your neighbourhood. 
There are 7,201 neighbourhoods (officially known as Middle-layer Super Output Areas or MSOAs) of England and Wales with an average population of around 8,000. Some neighbourhoods saw more than twice as many residents die than would have been expected for the time of year during the spring and summer of 2020, while excess deaths were spread out over a longer period in the following autumn and winter. 
Deaths between March 2020 and April 2021 are compared with the average for the same month between 2015 and 2019.

Our interactive chart and map let you see what happened where you live. 
3 August 2021
So far in England and Wales, there have been two periods during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic when weekly and monthly registrations of deaths from all causes were consistently higher than the five-year average – also known as “excess deaths”. 
Using weekly data, the first period was from the week ending 20 March to the week ending 12 June 2020 and the second was from the week ending 11 September 2020 to the week ending 5 March 2021. Using monthly data, the periods above average were from March to July 2020 and then from September 2020 to March 2021. 
Excess deaths are the clearest way to compare the likely impact of the pandemic over time, because a substantial number of non-COVID-19 excess deaths were recorded early in the pandemic, in March and April 2020. One reason for excess deaths could be that COVID-19 was undiagnosed.

Some areas experienced considerably more excess deaths, which are deaths from any cause above the average for the same time of year between 2015 and 2019, at different points in the pandemic than others. 
Deaths registered at an MSOA level were published monthly until April 2021. 
There are 7,201 neighbourhoods (officially known as middle layer super output areas or MSOAs) in England and Wales with an average population of around 8,000. 
This interactive chart will display the number of excess deaths in individual neighbourhoods in England and Wales. 
Deaths registered by MSOA, March 2020 to April 2021, compared with the average for 2015 to 2019 (XLSX, 3.8MB)
Overall, the North West, London and North East had the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in 2020. 
At an individual neighbourhood level between March and July 2020, some of the hardest hit places for overall excess deaths were spread across the north of England, Midlands and south of England. 
There were around 200 neighbourhoods where the number of deaths was at least double what would normally have been expected during those five months. 
These included Crabtree and Fir Vale in Sheffield, which had the largest excess, with 123 deaths between March and July 2020, 77 more than the average of 46, an excess of 167%. 
When infections and deaths due to COVID-19 increased again in the autumn of 2020, total deaths registered in England and Wales remained above average for seven months. 
Between September 2020 and March 2021, the West St Leonards area of Hastings recorded 184 deaths, which was 65 (55%) more than average. Of these, 45 were registered in January 2021. This was the highest monthly excess of any neighbourhood at this time. 
Out of 7,201 neighbourhoods, there are just 13 in England and one in Wales that recorded no deaths due to COVID-19 – where coronavirus was the main cause of death - up to April 2021. Most of these were in the South West of England, including parts of Cornwall and Devon. Some are also in built-up areas and include Bristol City Centre and Leeds City Centre. One area of Manchester, Castlegate and Deansfield, also recorded no deaths due to COVID-19. 
The only MSOA in Wales to have recorded no deaths due to COVID-19 by April 2021 was LLandudno Junction South and Llansanffraid Glan, Conwy.

Different local authorities have different sized populations and proportions of people of different ages. To make a fair comparison between these larger areas, this section uses age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs). 
Age-standardised mortality rate per month by local authority district, March 2020 to April 2021 (XLSX, 271KB)
The first peak in coronavirus deaths was in April 2020, while the country was in the middle of the first national lockdown. At this time, urban centres in London, Birmingham, the north of England and South Wales had the highest rates of deaths due to any cause. 
There were many reasons why certain communities experienced high death rates, with more deaths due to COVID-19 in the most deprived areas of England and Wales than in the least deprived areas. 
There were also higher death rates among some ethnic minority groups as well as in males and those with pre-existing conditions. There have also been higher death rates among people with jobs with regular exposure to COVID-19. 
Although overall deaths in England and Wales reduced during the summer of 2020, in some areas of northern England, such as Tameside and Blackburn with Darwen, mortality rates were higher than normal. 
The autumn and winter of 2020 saw mortality rates peak in different local areas in different months. In November 2020, mortality rates were highest in Rochdale and Blaenau Gwent and in December 2020 parts of Lincolnshire such as Lincoln and Boston recorded their highest mortality rates of the pandemic. 
As 2021 began with a third national lockdown, there were many areas in both England and Wales with high mortality rates; with the area from Essex to East London to East Sussex suffering due to the spread of the Alpha COVID-19 variant, first identified in Kent. 
In January 2021, the mortality rate in England was highest in Barking and Dagenham. In Wales, the highest was in Bridgend. 
On average, overall mortality rates in England and Wales declined in February 2021, although in some areas they were only reaching their peak. These areas included Copeland, Great Yarmouth, Bolsover and Norwich. In March 2021, Blackpool had the highest ASMR in England and Wales, but this was below its April 2020 peak. 
Since March 2021, deaths in England and Wales returned to average or near to average for the time of year, although deaths due to COVID-19 increased again in July. 
These are used for comparisons over time and between areas rather than numbers of deaths, as ASMRs account for differences in the population size and age structure. 
Excess deaths in this analysis are the difference between the number of deaths registered in each period (week or month) and the same period in the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Using the average gives us a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a ""normal"" year, before the COVID-19 pandemic.

239,"Infections continued to increase in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continued to increase in England and have increased in Wales and Northern Ireland in the week ending 24 July 2021, but decreased in Scotland.
The estimated percentage of the community population (those not in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings) that had COVID-19 was:
 - 1.57% (1 in 65 people) in England, up from 1.36% (1 in 75 people) last week
 - 0.62% (1 in 160 people) in Wales, up from 0.47% (1 in 210 people) last week
 - 1.48% (1 in 65 people) in Northern Ireland, up from 0.59% (1 in 170 people) last week
 - 0.94% (1 in 110 people) in Scotland, down from 1.24% (1 in 80 people) last week
Across England, positivity rates increased in the most recent week for those aged two years to school Year 11 and those aged 50 years and over, while the trend is uncertain for all other age groups.
Infections have also continued to increase in most English regions in the latest week, except for the East of England and South West, where the trend is uncertain.
While our findings for England may seem to contradict recent daily test and trace figures, it’s important to understand that the ONS survey tests a large randomised sample of the population regardless of whether they have symptoms. This and other factors may lie behind the apparent discrepancies.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/30july2021,"In England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to increase in the week ending 24 July 2021, though there are possible signs that the rate of increase may have slowed; we estimate that 856,200 people within the community population in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 798,600 to 915,000), equating to around 1 in 65 people.
In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive continued to increase in the week ending 24 July 2021; we estimate that 18,800 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 12,700 to 26,000), equating to around 1 in 160 people. 
In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive continued to increase in the week ending 24 July 2021; we estimate that 27,200 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 18,200 to 38,200), equating to around 1 in 65 people.
In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in the most recent week ending 24 July 2021; we estimate that 49,500 people in Scotland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 38,300 to 62,300) equating to around 1 in 110 people.

240,"Almost 1 in 10 young adults self-isolated this week
Almost 1 in 10 (9%) 16- to 29-year-olds said they had self-isolated in the past seven days. Young adults were three times more likely to be self-isolating than those aged 70 years and over (3%). Overall, 6% of adults said they were self-isolating, similar to the 7% last week.
Over 9 in 10 (95%) adults said they had worn a face covering outside their home in the last seven days, the same figure as the week before. This is despite the further easing of legal restrictions in England on 19 July 2021. 
Those saying they always or often maintained social distance fell slightly from 63% last week to 61%. 
Most adults felt that measures such as wearing a face covering while shopping (90%) and social distancing (88%) were either very important or important. These figures are unchanged from last week. 
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/23july2021,"This week, over the period 14 to 18 July 2021, based on adults in Great Britain:
A similar proportion of adults reported always or often maintaining social distancing (63%) to last week (62% in the period 7 to 11 July); this was a reduction from 85% between 14 and 18 April following step two of the roadmap in England.
A high proportion of adults continued to feel that compliance with measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) were either very important or important; such as wearing a face covering while shopping (90% this week and last week) and socially distancing from others not in their household, childcare or support bubble (89% this week, 88% last week).
Adults meeting up outdoors with someone not in their household, childcare or support bubble in the past seven days increased to around 6 in 10 (58% this week, 53% last week), having increased from 20% in the week ending 7 March before outdoor activity restrictions were lifted with step one of the roadmap; around half (47%) of adults said they met up indoors (49% last week), having increased from 20% in the week ending 9 May before indoor restrictions were lifted with step three of the roadmap in England.
Almost two-thirds (64%) of working adults travelled to work at some point in the past seven days (60% last week); this includes half (50%) of working adults travelling to work exclusively and not working from home (46% last week); this has increased from mid-February (34% in the period 10 to 14 February 2021).
Anxiety levels slightly decreased (3.8 this week, 4.0 last week) after having appeared to gradually increase since early June 2021 (3.6 in the period 2 to 6 June); other personal well-being measures remained stable, levels of feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile (7.3) and happiness (7.1) were unchanged from last week and life satisfaction increased slightly (7.1 this week, 7.0 last week).
As the plan to ease coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions in England from 19 July 2021 approached, the proportion of adults who felt that life would not return to normal for more than a year appeared to increase (32% this week, 28% last week), while the proportion who felt life would return to normal in six months or less decreased (15% this week, 20% last week).
Positive sentiment towards the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine remained high with 96% (95% last week) of adults reporting they had now either received a vaccine or would be likely to have a vaccine if offered, an increase since the beginning of the vaccination programme (78% between 10 and 13 December 2020).
"
241,"Most people stick to self-isolation rules after positive test
The majority of people in England who are required to self-isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) report fully adhering to the rules.
Between 5 and 10 July 2021 and 7 to 12 June 2021, 79% of all those required not to leave their home or receive visitors reported adhering to these requirements throughout their self-isolation period.
This is statistically significantly lower compared with data collected between 10 and 15 May 2021, which showed 86% reported fully adhering to the requirements.
In September 2020, a new legal duty was introduced in England, requiring people to self-isolate for 10 days if they tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19).
In July 2021 fewer people aged 18 to 34 years adhered to the rules on self-isolation (75%), compared with those aged between 35 and 54 years (86%).
The data presented in this bulletin were collected from individuals who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had recently reached or were nearing the end of their self-isolation period.
These data were collected between 5 and 10 July 2021, during a period in which national lockdown restrictions had eased to step three of the four-step roadmap out of lockdown in England.

The majority (78%) of those who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) reported having no contact with non-household members while they had any symptoms of illness or during the self-isolation period; this is statistically significantly lower than the percentage reporting no contact between 10 and 15 May (84%).
Approximately 4 in 10 (42%) of those who tested positive reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their well-being and mental health.

242,"Highest UK flight numbers since before first national lockdown 
The number of UK daily flights has reached the highest level seen since the week to 22 March 2020 (the day before the first national lockdown was implemented across the UK). 
Data from EUROCONTROL on international and domestic UK flights show the seven-day average of daily flights rose by 17% in the week to 25 July 2021 from the previous week, to 2,877 daily flights.
The average number of daily flights in the latest week is 147% of the level seen in the equivalent week in 2020 (when UK travel corridors were in place). However, it is still less than half (43%) of the level seen in the equivalent week in 2019. 
The data includes commercial flights carrying passengers and cargo as well as non-commercial flights such as private and military flights. Especially in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, flights might not be operating at full capacity and therefore trends in passengers and cargo will differ from trends in flights presented here.

In the week ending 18 July 2021, average counts of traffic camera activity for ""pedestrians and cyclists"" in Manchester and London saw week-on-week decreases of 42% and 12%, respectively; these large weekly falls were in-part driven by higher than usual ""pedestrians and cyclists"" counts over the previous weekend (Transport for Greater Manchester, Transport for London). See the accompanying dataset.
"
243,"Viral load lower for COVID-19 reinfection
Second coronavirus (COVID-19) infections have a significantly lower viral load than first infections, suggesting reinfection is less likely to cause illness. 
Viral load is determined by how quickly a test can detect the virus, measured by the cycle threshold (Ct). Positive COVID-19 tests with a low Ct value (30 or less) indicate a higher viral load, while a high Ct value suggests a lower viral load.
Consistent with previous results, analysis of Ct values at first and second infection found that viral load is significantly higher for the first infection than the second, indicating that an individual may have an effective immune response to reinfection.
From the 19,470 participants who had previously recovered from a COVID-19 infection, 195 reinfections were identified. However, of the 195 reinfections, only 48 had a high viral load with Ct less than 30. These results suggest that the number of reinfections is low overall, and reinfections with a high viral load are even lower.
Of those who test positive for COVID-19 with a high viral load, 61% reported symptoms in July 2021. Symptoms reported were more likely to be “classic” symptoms than gastrointestinal or loss of taste or smell only. The prevalence of any symptoms and “classic symptoms” were higher in June and July, and January and February, compared with March and April. The most commonly reported symptoms have consistently been cough, fatigue and headache.

The number of deaths from all causes in the UK in the week ending 16 July 2021 was 11,053, which is 4.9% above the average for the corresponding week in 2015 to 2019. 
Deaths were above the five-year average in England and Scotland, and below the five-year average in Wales and Northern Ireland. 
Of these, 268 deaths were registered involving coronavirus (COVID-19), accounting for around 1 in 41 deaths (2.4%). This is a 23.5% increase on the previous week. 
The number of deaths from COVID-19 increased in England, Scotland, and increased slightly in Wales compared with the previous week. In Northern Ireland, they remained level. 
Deaths include people who are not in their usual country of residence.
Using the most up-to-date data, the total number of deaths involving COVID-19 in England and Wales is over 140,000 (141,156 registrations up to 16 July 2021). Between 13 March 2020 and 9 July 2021, there have been 104,115 excess deaths above the five-year average.
Our data are based on deaths registered in England and Wales and include all deaths where “novel coronavirus (COVID-19)” was mentioned on the death certificate. Weekly figures are available by local authority and health board.

245,"England's COVID-19 mortality rate in June was similar to May
Mortality rates due to coronavirus (COVID-19) in England were similar in June 2021 to the previous month. Before June, mortality rates due to COVID-19 had significantly decreased for four consecutive months.
This mortality rate accounts for the size and age structure of the population and is called the “age-standardised mortality rate” (ASMR).
The ASMR of deaths due to COVID-19 (where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death) was 7.5 deaths per 100,000 people in England, compared with 7.1 in May 2021. This increase was not statistically significant. In Wales, there were two deaths due to COVID-19, which was too small to calculate a reliable ASMR.
The ASMR excludes non-residents.
Provisional data show a total of 38,611 deaths registered in England in June 2021. This was 1,275 fewer deaths than in June 2020 and 310 more than the June five-year average (2015 to 2019).
In Wales in June 2021, there were 2,560 deaths registered, 132 deaths fewer than in June 2020 and 26 more than the five-year average.
The leading cause of death in both England and Wales in June 2021 was ischaemic heart diseases (10.8% and 11.9% of all deaths respectively).
This compares COVID-19 as a leading cause in 0.9% of all deaths registered in June in England and 0.1% of all deaths in Wales.

The leading cause of death in June 2021 was ischaemic heart diseases in both England (accounting for 10.8% of all deaths) and Wales (11.9% of all deaths).
Coronavirus (COVID-19) was the 26th leading cause of death in June 2021 in England (accounting for 0.9% of all deaths registered in June); in Wales, COVID-19 accounted for 0.1% of all deaths so the numbers were too small to reliably rank against other leading causes of death.
The age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths due to COVID-19 in England were similar in June 2021 (7.5 deaths per 100,000 people) to May 2021 (7.1 deaths per 100,000 people); in Wales there were 2 deaths due to COVID-19 so ASMRs were not calculated for June 2021.
The North West of England was the English region with the highest ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 in June 2021 (17.8 deaths per 100,000 people) and was the only region to significantly increase between May and June 2021; rates for all other English regions and Wales remained similar or could not be calculated because of small numbers of deaths in June 2021.

247,"Doubt about return to normality within a year
Almost one in three (32%) adults felt that it would take more than a year for life to return to normal in the week (14 to 18 July 2021) approaching the easing of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions in England on 19 July 2021. This figure slightly increased from 28% the previous week, while the proportion who felt life would return to normal in six months or less decreased from 20% to 15%. 
A high proportion of adults continue to feel that compliance measures to slow the spread of coronavirus are either “very important” or “important”. One in nine (90%) think it is important to wear a face covering when shopping (the same proportion as the previous week), and 89% believe it is important to socially distance from those not in their household (88% the previous week). 
Over the period 14 to 18 July 2021, a similar proportion of adults reported always or often maintaining social distancing (63%) to the previous week (62%). This figure has fallen from 85% in the week 14 to 18 April 2021 following step two of the roadmap out of lockdown in England.

A similar proportion of adults reported always or often maintaining social distancing (63%) to last week (62% in the period 7 to 11 July); this was a reduction from 85% between 14 and 18 April following step two of the roadmap in England.
A high proportion of adults continued to feel that compliance with measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) were either very important or important; such as wearing a face covering while shopping (90% this week and last week) and socially distancing from others not in their household, childcare or support bubble (89% this week, 88% last week).
Adults meeting up outdoors with someone not in their household, childcare or support bubble in the past seven days increased to around 6 in 10 (58% this week, 53% last week), having increased from 20% in the week ending 7 March before outdoor activity restrictions were lifted with step one of the roadmap; around half (47%) of adults said they met up indoors (49% last week), having increased from 20% in the week ending 9 May before indoor restrictions were lifted with step three of the roadmap in England.
Almost two-thirds (64%) of working adults travelled to work at some point in the past seven days (60% last week); this includes half (50%) of working adults travelling to work exclusively and not working from home (46% last week); this has increased from mid-February (34% in the period 10 to 14 February 2021).
Anxiety levels slightly decreased (3.8 this week, 4.0 last week) after having appeared to gradually increase since early June 2021 (3.6 in the period 2 to 6 June); other personal well-being measures remained stable, levels of feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile (7.3) and happiness (7.1) were unchanged from last week and life satisfaction increased slightly (7.1 this week, 7.0 last week).
As the plan to ease coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions in England from 19 July 2021 approached, the proportion of adults who felt that life would not return to normal for more than a year appeared to increase (32% this week, 28% last week), while the proportion who felt life would return to normal in six months or less decreased (15% this week, 20% last week).
Positive sentiment towards the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine remained high with 96% (95% last week) of adults reporting they had now either received a vaccine or would be likely to have a vaccine if offered, an increase since the beginning of the vaccination programme (78% between 10 and 13 December 2020).

248,"Fuel sales rise and retail sales move more offline
Automotive fuel sales volumes increased 2.3% in the month to June 2021 as people continued to increase their amount of travel, while the proportion of online retail sales dipped in favour of physical stores.
Retail sales volumes in the three months to June 2021 were 12.2% higher than in the previous three months, largely driven by particularly strong sales in April when non-essential retail reopened.
The proportion of retail sales made online remains much higher than before the pandemic, but dropped in June to 26.7%, down from 28.4% in May.
Overall, retail sales volumes in the month to June 2021 rose 0.5%, and are now 9.5% higher than their pre-pandemic levels (compared with February 2020).
Food stores were the biggest contributor to that monthly increase (up 4.2%), anecdotally linked to the start of the Euro 2020 football championship. Non-food stores reported a fall in sales volumes over the month of 1.7%.

The largest contribution to the monthly increase in June 2021 came from food stores where sales volumes rose by 4.2%, with anecdotal evidence suggesting these increased sales may be linked with the start of the Euro 2020 football championship. 
Non-food stores reported a fall of 1.7% in sales volumes in June 2021 when compared with May 2021, driven by falls in household goods stores, such as furniture stores and clothing stores.
Automotive fuel sales increased by 2.3% over the month, as people continued to increase their amount of travel; however, they remain 2.1% below their pre-coronavirus pandemic February 2020 levels. 
The volume of sales for the three months to June 2021 was 12.2% higher than in the previous three months, driven in large part by particularly strong sales in April when non-essential retailing re-opened; strong three-month growth was seen in non-food retailers and automotive fuel sales of 35.8% and 23.6% respectively.
The proportion of retail sales conducted online remains substantially higher than before the pandemic, but in June most retail sectors reported a fall in their proportions of online sales as consumers returned to physical stores; the total proportion of sales online decreased to 26.7% in June 2021, down from 28.4% in May 2021.

249,"Online job adverts 30% higher than February 2020 average
The volume of online job adverts on 16 July 2021 had increased across all UK countries and English regions from the previous week, bringing the total UK volume to 130% of its February 2020 average. 
This is 7 percentage points higher than the volume of online job adverts seen in the equivalent week of 2019, and is considerably higher than the volume seen in the same week of 2020, according to data from Adzuna.

Further category breakdowns are included in the  online job advert estimates dataset and more details on the methodology can be found in  Using Adzuna data to derive an indicator of weekly vacancies.
Users should note that week-on-week changes in online job advert volumes are outlined as percentages, rather than as percentage point changes. Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the charts and accompanying dataset. 

Just three of 28 job advert categories were below their February 2020 average levels in the latest week. These were ""energy, oil and gas"", ""legal"" and ""graduate"", at 87%, 95% and 99% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively.
The highest performing category relative to its pre-pandemic level remained the ""transport/logistics/warehouse"" category, at 302% of its February 2020 average level.

250,"Coronavirus lockdown shows marked effect on crimes
Fraud and computer misuse offences have increased in England and Wales by 36% since the first coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown from April to June 2020.
Crime figures for the year ending March 2021, showed this increase in comparison with the year ending March 2019 (Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW)). This also accompanied a 20% decrease in theft offences. 
While people were being told to stay at home during the first lockdown, acquisitive crimes such as burglaries declined, because criminals were unable to take advantage of homes being empty at predictable times, for example, for work. 
Police recorded crime also showed a decrease in these types of offences and in crime overall (13%), excluding fraud and computer misuse. The first three months of the first national lockdown, from April to June 2020, showed the largest drop in recorded crimes, 19% compared with the same period in 2019. 
Police recorded crime also captured a decline in the number of violent offences in the year ending March 2020, with a 16% decline in murders, 14% fall in firearms offences and a 15% drop in knife crime. 
Total recorded crime, excluding fraud and computer misuse, has fluctuated across the year ending March 2021. Overall, there was a 10% decrease on the previous year.
Most of the differences can be attributed to the introduction and subsequent easing of national lockdown restrictions throughout the year.   
The most substantial drop in crime came in April 2020, compared with April 2019, and remained lower across subsequent months in comparison with the same time periods in 2019. This coincided with the introduction of the first national lockdown. 
The difference narrowed in tandem with the easing of lockdown restrictions over the summer of 2020 and widened again as restrictions were reintroduced. 
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2021,"Patterns of crime in the year ending March 2021 have been significantly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and government instructions to limit social contact. While there were decreases across a range of individual crime types, particularly theft offences, these were offset by rises in fraud and computer misuse offences, resulting in no change in overall levels of crime. 
The Telephone Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) indicated a 36% increase in fraud and computer misuse offences compared with the year ending March 20191 Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). 
TCSEW total crime excluding fraud and computer misuse decreased by 19% compared with the year ending March 2019. This was largely driven by substantial decreases in theft offences (20%). Over the equivalent time-period, total police recorded crime excluding fraud and computer misuse decreased by 13%. 
The largest decreases in recorded crime were seen during the three-month period that coincided with the first national lockdown, with a 19% decrease in April to June 2020 compared with April to June 2019.
Although the TCSEW indicated no change in the total number of violence incidents, the total number of victims of violent crime decreased by 28% compared with the year ending March 20192. This was largely driven by falls in violence where the offender was a stranger. 
Police recorded crime gives more insight into the lower-volume but higher-harm violence that the survey either does not cover or does not capture well. These data show that compared with the year ending March 2020: 
the number of homicides decreased by 16% to 600 offences
there was a 14% fall in the number of police recorded offences involving firearms
there was a 15% fall in offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime), driven by substantial decreases in periods coinciding with national lockdowns

251,"COVID-19 antibodies continue to rise in line with vaccinations
An estimated 91.9% of the adult population in England, 92.6% in Wales, 90.0% in Northern Ireland and 88.6% in Scotland would have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in the week beginning 28 June 2021. 
During the same week, estimated vaccination rates continued to increase in all four UK countries. 
The presence of antibodies suggests a person previously had COVID-19 or has been vaccinated. 
Antibody positivity increases with age, reflecting age prioritisation in vaccination programmes. Estimated vaccination rates are lowest in younger age groups but are increasing, with the percentage of adults aged 25 to 34 years who have received one or more doses increasing sharply since the end of May.
Because of small sample sizes, some age groups are combined in Northern Ireland.
These statistics refer to antibody tests and vaccinations among people living in private households, and exclude those in hospitals, care homes and other institutional settings.
Our estimates of vaccination are provided for context alongside our antibodies estimates. The daily official government figures provide the actual numbers of vaccines issued.

In Scotland, it is estimated that nearly 9 in 10 adults, or 88.6% of the adult population (95% credible interval: 86.7% to 90.3%) would have tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 on a blood test in the week beginning 28 June 2021, suggesting they had the infection in the past or have been vaccinated.
Across all four countries of the UK, there is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies but the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination.

252,"Long COVID most often impacted general well-being
Around 6 in 10 (57%) adults who said they may have experienced long COVID (“yes” or “not sure” to the question ‘Have you experienced “long COVID”?’) said it had negatively affected their general well-being.
Around 4 in 10 (39%) of such adults said their ability to exercise had been affected, while 3 in 10 (30%) said it had negatively impacted their work, with this rising to around 4 in 10 (38%) among working adults who said they may have experienced long COVID.
These findings are from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, covering the period 7 April to 13 June 2021.
Of adults who said they may have experienced long COVID, a quarter (25%) were likely to have some form of anxiety compared with 15% of those who reported they had not had COVID-19 at all. Three in ten adults (30%) who said they may have experienced long COVID reported experiencing moderate to severe depressive symptoms in the last two weeks compared with 16% of those who have not had COVID at all.
Those who reported they may have experienced long COVID were also more likely to report being often or always lonely (10%) than those who reported that they had short COVID (6%) or had not had COVID at all (6%).
This does not necessarily mean that experiencing long COVID itself increases the likelihood of either depression, anxiety or loneliness. More work is needed to disentangle the effects of long COVID from a variety of factors such as age, sex or disability.

In May 2020, turnover fell to £1.2 billion but has since recovered to £6.9 billion in May 2021. This is still behind the May 2019 value of £9.2 billion. 
Consumer spending data by Revolut show that in spring 2021, spending in the hospitality sector reached its highest level since summer 2020. However, data from Vocalink show that increased consumer spending has not yet fed through to suppliers. The total value of payments from food and drink businesses to their suppliers and contractors in May 2021 was only 51% of the values in February 2020. 
Trends in the labour market reflect those of industry turnover. Since early April 2021, the number of people on furlough has been declining and fell to its lowest level of 0.6 million in late May 2021. There have also been increases in the number of payrolled employees and average hours worked, although these remain below pre-pandemic levels. 
Despite signs of recovery in the hospitality industry, business confidence remains low. All hospitality sub-sectors report lower levels of confidence that their business will survive the next three months, compared with the all-industry average.

What are people looking forward to, and which coronavirus restrictions will they continue to follow? 
16 July 2021
Two-thirds (64%) of adults in Great Britain said they still plan to cover their faces in shops, following the lifting of most coronavirus legal restrictions in England from 19 July 2021. 
The same percentage (64%) plan to wear masks on public transport, while 60% plan to avoid crowded places. 
Over half (54%) of adults said they are looking forward to going on holiday abroad when coronavirus rules end. 
In our latest weekly release from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, a large majority of adults continued to feel that wearing face coverings (90%) and social distancing from others not in their household, childcare or support bubble are important (88%) in slowing the spread of COVID-19. 
More than half (57%) of adults in Great Britain, surveyed between 7 and 11 July 2021, said they are worried about the plan to remove legal restrictions. This includes one-fifth (20%) who are very worried. 
The percentage that believe normal life is a year or more away was 28%, slightly more than the 25% who believed this a year ago, between 8 and 12 July 2020, but down from the peak of 41% who thought so between 16 and 20 September 2020. 
The easing of restrictions differs between countries. In England, face coverings will no longer be required by law, but will be required on public transport in London and other parts of the country as a condition of travel. 
In Scotland, restrictions are also being eased on 19 July 2021 but there will still be limits on how many people can meet indoors and outdoors, with one-metre physical distancing and a cap of 200 people at weddings and funerals. Face coverings will also continue to be required. 
In Wales, from 17 July 2021 up to six people will be allowed to meet indoors, and indoor events will be permitted for up to 1,000 people seated and up to 200 standing. Most other restrictions in Wales will be lifted from 7 August. However, face coverings will still be required in most indoor public spaces, except for hospitality businesses.

Mask wearing both in shops and on public transport is likely to be lowest among younger people, with 51% of those aged 16 to 29 years saying they were planning to do so in either setting. 
The percentage of people likely to wear masks in shops increases with age, with 74% of those aged 70 years and over planning to do so. On public transport, 69% of those aged 70 years and over said they plan to wear face coverings compared with 70% aged 50 to 69 years. 
Almost half of adults (49%) plan to maintain social distancing around others they do not live with. The percentage was lowest among those aged 16 to 29 years (31%) and highest among those aged 50 to 69 years (59%). 
Among working adults, 30% plan to work from home. Previous analysis has shown that in 2020, the proportion of individuals working remotely has been declining since March 2021 as restrictions began to ease. Evidence from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey and Business Insights and Conditions Survey suggests individuals and workplaces anticipate increased levels of hybrid working after the pandemic.
Three-quarters (75%) of adults plan to sanitise their hands regularly. 
Almost one-third (32%) of adults are likely to avoid travelling abroad, however, it was announced during the survey period, on 8 July 2021, that the rules would be changed to allow double-vaccinated people to go to amber list countries without quarantining on their return to the UK. 
Download data for activities adults are looking forward to (XLSX, 19 KB)
People aged 16 to 29 years were the most likely age group to be looking forward to activities that involve meeting others. This age group had the highest percentages wanting to do activities such as meeting indoors with no limits on the number of people (54%), going to the cinema or theatre with no social distancing (47%), staying at someone else’s house with no limits on numbers of guests (46%), or going to concerts or nightclubs (44%). 
When asked what they were looking forward to doing when restrictions end, going on holiday abroad was the option that was chosen most, by 54% of adults. 
Younger people aged 16 to 29 years were the most likely to say they wanted to do this (62%). 
It was also the most commonly selected option for all other age groups except those aged 70 years and older. 
Among those aged 70 years and older, 47% of adults chose “hugging people I do not live with” as something they were looking forward to when restrictions are lifted. It was also chosen by 48% of adults overall. However, there have been different rules on meeting and hugging indoors in different nations. 
With no more limits on guests at weddings, 47% of adults were looking forward to attending life events. 
Restrictions will also be lifted on communal worship. Of all adults, 18% said they were looking forward to singing with others in a public indoor place. 
Around 7% of working adults said they were looking forward to no longer working from home. 
Download data for how worried or unworried adults are (XLSX, 18 KB)
Asked how much of a personal risk they thought catching coronavirus was to them, 29% of adults in Great Britain overall considered it to be a very high or high risk and 32% considered it to be a very low or low risk. 
While younger people are more likely than older people to be keen to do things that involve meeting others, those aged 16 to 29 years also considered themselves to have the lowest personal risk from catching coronavirus (COVID-19). 47% of this age group said they considered themselves to be at very low or low risk.
Those aged 70 years and over considered themselves to be at the most risk, with 39% considering themselves to be at very high or high risk. 
Among adults in Great Britain, 20% were very worried and 36% somewhat worried about the plan to end coronavirus (COVID-19) rules in England on 19 July 2021. 
This compares with 5% who were somewhat unworried and 15% of adults who were not at all worried about the plan. 
Despite recent coronavirus infections being highest in younger age groups, those aged 16 to 29 years were the least likely to say they were worried, with 42% either very or somewhat worried. 
Among those aged 30 to 49 years and 50 to 69 years, 22% of people were very worried about the plan to end restrictions. 
The UK government has said that while the pandemic is not over, there is evidence that the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has weakened the link between cases, hospital admissions and deaths. 
Download data for how long adults think it will be before life returns to normal (XLSX, 29 KB)
Even with the plan to ease coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions in England from 19 July 2021, more adults in Great Britain (28%) still believed that normal life is a year or more away than believed it will return in six months or less (20%), according to those surveyed between 7 and 11 July 2021. 
The point at which people thought normal life was the furthest away was between 16 and 20 September 2020, when 41% of people believed it would be at least another 12 months from then. 
This was around the time the “rule of six” which limited social mixing came into force, followed by other restrictions from limiting the opening hours of certain businesses, such as pubs, to limits on the number of guests at weddings and civil partnerships. 
The percentage of adults who believed normal life was at least a year away fell around the start of a second national lockdown in England, in November 2020, which was also when it was revealed that a COVID-19 vaccine offered significant protection. 
In February 2021, it was announced that there was to be a four-stage roadmap out of lockdown in England. At around this point, 20% believed that normal life was at least 12 months away, the lowest proportion since the early 2021 lockdown. This then increased over the following months. 
Even with the announcement that many restrictions will be lifted, 7% of adults asked in the latest week believed that normal life, as it was before the pandemic, will never return, while 24% were not sure.

257,"Vast majority self-isolate after coronavirus (COVID-19) contact
Almost 9 in 10 (89%) of those who had contact with a positive coronavirus (COVID-19) case fully adhered to self-isolation requirements throughout the entire isolation period, according to data collected between 28 June and 3 July 2021.
This figure is slightly higher than the 87% who reported full adherence during the previous survey (1 to 5 June 2021) but statistically significantly lower than the 93% between 4 and 8 May 2021.
Of those who did not adhere, 79% left their house at least once for a non-permitted reason, and 27% had one or more visitors to their home (excluding visits for personal care).
Most (91%) of those required to self-isolate following contact with a positive case of COVID-19 reported having no contact with non-household members. This figure is similar to the 93% who reported no contact from 1 to 5 June 2021.
Over a third (37%) reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their well-being and mental health, and 28% reported having lost income because of self-isolation.

258,"Just over 4 in 10 businesses provided no training to furloughed staff
The percentage of businesses currently trading has increased steadily from 71% in January 2021 to 89% in early July 2021.
This is the highest percentage of businesses currently trading since comparable estimates began in June 2020, and higher than in late September and early October 2020, when few coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were in place across the UK, according to the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS; Wave 34).
Asked if they had provided training to their workforce while on furlough, around 18% of businesses said they had, while 43% said they had not. The question was not applicable for a quarter (25%) of businesses that had not permanently stopped trading, while the remaining 15% responded that they were not sure.
Businesses were also asked which skills were in high demand in the last 12 months or that their workforce require extra support or training in. In the chart below columns will not sum to 100% as businesses could select multiple options.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/businessservices/bulletins/businessinsightsandimpactontheukeconomy/15july2021,"The proportion of businesses' workforce reported to be on full or partial furlough leave fell to 5% in late June 2021 (provisional range of 4% to 6%) as a result of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions being relaxed across the UK; and the proportion of the workforce reported to be on partial furlough is now higher than on full furlough.
The transportation and storage industry had the lowest percentage of businesses currently trading in early July 2021, at 81% (lower than 89% for all industries), at a time when a shortage of lorry drivers was being reported in some media. This is below the 94% reported in early October 2020.
The proportions of businesses experiencing challenges in importing and exporting are broadly unchanged since January 2021, with additional paperwork remaining the top challenge faced by businesses for importing and exporting.
24% of currently trading businesses reported that the prices of materials, goods or services bought in the last two weeks had increased by more than normal price fluctuations, and in contrast, only 8% of businesses currently trading reported that they had increased the price of goods or services sold.
Of business not permanently stopped trading, just over 4 in 10 provided no training to furloughed staff.

259,"Average daily UK flights rose by 9% in the latest week
In the week to Sunday 11 July 2021, the seven-day average number of daily flights to, from and within the UK rose by 9% from the previous week to 2,307 daily flights, according to data from EUROCONTROL.
This is 69% higher than the equivalent week in 2020 but remains at around a third of the level seen in the equivalent week in 2019.
Flight numbers have steadily increased since the introduction of the green list of foreign countries in mid-May. Earlier in the year, average daily flight figures were much lower at around 1,000 per day.
During July and August 2020, as travel corridors were introduced in the UK, flights steadily increased to nearly 3,000 per day (around 40% of the 2019 level), after falling to around 500 a day (10% of the 2019 level) during the first national lockdown.

See Section 3.
The volume of all motor vehicle traffic on Monday 12 July was at 93% of the level seen on the Monday of the first week in February 2020, a 4 percentage point decrease from a week ago and the largest week-on-week decrease seen since the Spring Bank Holiday on Monday 31 May 2021 (Department for Transport ). See Section 4.
In June 2021, the monthly CHAPS-based indicator of aggregate credit and debit card spending decreased by 4 percentage points compared with May 2021 to 95% of its February 2020 average level; the first time that the monthly CHAPS-based index has decreased month-on-month since January 2021 (Bank of England CHAPS data). See Section 5.
On 9 July 2021, the total volume of UK online job adverts had decreased by 4% when compared with the previous week (2 July 2021), but remained much higher than pre-pandemic levels at 129% of its February 2020 average level (Adzuna). See Section 6.

Currently trading UK businesses reported that 11% of their workforce have moved from furlough or fully homeworking to a hybrid model of working, i.e. spending at least some of their time at their usual place of work, in the last two weeks (at the point at which they responded) (Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) 14 to 27 June 2021). See Section 9.

260,"3 in 10 clinically extremely vulnerable adults still shielding despite pause in guidance
Between 21 and 26 June 2021, around 3 in 10 (29%) of the 3.7 million adults identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to coronavirus (COVID-19) in England were continuing to shield. 
This is despite a change in government advice from 1 April 2021, which no longer required CEV people to shield. Instead, they were advised to take precautionary measures to protect themselves, such as meeting others outside where possible. 
The latest data show that only 37% of CEV adults were comfortable or very comfortable about going to hospitality, education or cultural settings. Of those who were not comfortable, the most commonly reported measures that would help put them at ease included: 
 - mandatory wearing of face coverings (75%)
 - regular sanitation, including use of hand sanitiser (75%)
 - procedures at venues to enable social distancing and avoiding close contact (69%)

261,"Deaths from COVID-19 increased slightly in England and Wales
The number of deaths from all causes in England and Wales in the week ending 2 July 2021 was 8,808, which is 5.2% below the average for the corresponding week in 2015 to 2019. 
Of these, 109 deaths were registered involving coronavirus (COVID-19), accounting for around one in 81 deaths (1.2%). This is a higher proportion than in the previous week, where deaths involving COVID-19 accounted for around 1 in 120 deaths. 
Deaths include non-residents. 
The proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 has been highest in those aged 75 years and over throughout the pandemic, however, this proportion has been lower since the start of January 2021. This likely reflects the impact of vaccinations. 
Using the most up-to-date data, the total number of deaths involving COVID-19 in England and Wales is over 140,000 (140,699 registrations up to 2 July 2021). 
Our data are based on deaths registered in England and Wales and include all deaths where “novel coronavirus (COVID-19)” was mentioned on the death certificate. Weekly figures are available by  local authority and health board.

262,"COVID-19 antibodies continue to rise in line with vaccinations across the UK countries
An estimated 89.8% of the adult population in England, 91.8% in Wales, 87.2% in Northern Ireland and 84.7% in Scotland tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in the week beginning 14 June 2021. 
During the same week, estimated vaccination rates continued to increase in all four UK countries. 
The presence of antibodies suggests a person previously had COVID-19 or has been vaccinated. 
Antibody positivity increases with age, reflecting age prioritisation in vaccination programmes. Vaccination rates are lowest in younger age groups but are increasing. Across the four UK countries, the estimated percentage of adults aged 25 to 34 years who have received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccination ranged from 75.7% to 79.6%. This has increased sharply since the end of May 2021. 
These statistics refer to antibody tests and vaccinations among people living in private households, and exclude those in hospitals, care homes and other institutional settings. 
Our estimates of vaccination are provided for context alongside our antibodies estimates. The daily official government figures provide the actual numbers of vaccines issued.

In Wales, it is estimated that 9 in 10 adults, or 91.8% of the adult population (95% credible interval: 90.1% to 93.3%) would have tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 on a blood test in the week beginning 14 June 2021, suggesting they had the infection in the past or have been vaccinated.
In Northern Ireland, it is estimated that close to 9 in 10 adults, or 87.2% of the adult population (95% credible interval: 84.2% to 90.2%) would have tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 on a blood test in the week beginning 14 June 2021, suggesting they had the infection in the past or have been vaccinated.
In Scotland, it is estimated that over 8 in 10 adults, or 84.7% of the adult population (95% credible interval: 82.4% to 86.9%) would have tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 on a blood test in the week beginning 14 June 2021, suggesting they had the infection in the past or have been vaccinated.
Across all four countries of the UK, there is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies but the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination.

263,"North West and London had highest coronavirus death rate in 2020
The North West was the region with the highest coronavirus (COVID-19) death rate in 2020, accounting for age and population structure, followed by London.
There were 73,766 deaths due to COVID-19 registered in 2020 in England and Wales, 12.1% of all deaths registered within the year.
Deaths “due” to COVID-19 are deaths where coronavirus is an underlying cause, as recorded on a death certificate.
Of deaths in hospital in 2020, nearly 1 in 5 (19.6%) were due to COVID-19. In care homes and communal establishments, deaths due to COVID-19 were 13.4% and 12.2% of deaths, respectively.
Of deaths registered in 2020, most people who died due to COVID-19 in England and Wales had a pre-existing health condition.
A small proportion (5.4%) of deaths registered as due to COVID-19 in 2020 were attributed to the disease after diagnosis based on symptoms without a test to confirm, or when a test result was inconclusive. This was rare after Spring 2020 and is likely because of limited availability of testing at the beginning of the pandemic.

A small proportion (5.4%) of deaths registered as due to COVID-19 in 2020 were attributed to the disease after diagnosis based on symptoms without a test to confirm, or when a test result was inconclusive. This was rare after Spring 2020 and is likely because of limited availability of testing at the beginning of the pandemic.

265,"Almost 9 in 10 adults say they have had their first coronavirus vaccine
Positive sentiment towards coronavirus vaccines remains high, at 96% among adults in Great Britain. 
Nearly 9 in 10 (89%) adults reported having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine when surveyed between 23 and 27 June 2021, and 63% reported receiving their second dose. 
Among young people aged 16 to 29 years, 93% were positive towards the vaccines in the latest survey, between 23 and 27 June 2021. 
For the first time, we have also looked at vaccine hesitancy among specific younger age groups during the period 26 May to 20 June 2021. 
Around 14% of young people aged 16 to 17 years in Great Britain reported hesitancy towards the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, while 86% felt positive sentiment towards them. 
This was the highest vaccine hesitancy among younger age groups, although most 16 to 17-year-olds are not currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. 
Among those aged 18 to 21 years, 9% reported hesitancy, compared with 10% among those aged 22 to 25 years.

More than 9 in 10 (96%) adults reported positive sentiment towards a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, while 4% reported vaccine hesitancy.
Vaccine hesitancy has decreased slightly from the previous period (6% over the period 28 April to 23 May 2021); although this decrease was not statistically significant, there is a longer term trend of declining hesitancy which is also observed across most population groups.
For the first time we've looked at younger age groups - 86% of those aged 16 to 17 years reported positive sentiment towards a COVID-19 vaccine, while 14% reported vaccine hesitancy, the highest vaccine hesitancy compared with those aged 18 to 21 years (9%), and those aged 22 to 25 years (10%).
The same rates of vaccine hesitancy were reported by women and men (both 4%).
Black or Black British adults had the highest rates of vaccine hesitancy (18%) compared with White adults (4%).
Vaccine hesitancy was higher for adults identifying Muslim (15%) or Other (11%) as their religion1, compared with adults who identify as Christian (3%); however, there was no statistically significant difference when compared with any of the remaining religious groups.
In London, 7% of adults reported vaccine hesitancy - a higher percentage than most other regions in England.

266,"COVID-19 reinfections are rare and milder than initial infections
29 June 2021
The rate of reinfection for coronavirus (COVID-19) is low, according to analysis from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. 
There is also evidence that COVID-19 reinfections are milder than the first infection. 
The strength of an infection is measured by a cycle threshold (Ct) value. Positive results with a low Ct value (30 or less) indicate episodes of infection with a higher viral load and tests with a high Ct value (more than 30) indicate a lower viral load. Most people who were reinfected had a low Ct value in the initial episode and a high Ct value in the reinfection episode. 
Those who were reinfected were also less likely to report symptoms within 35 days following the observed first positive test in their reinfection episode (57.1%) than in their initial infection episode (21.8%), suggesting reinfections are more likely to be asymptomatic. 
To distinguish reinfection from an ongoing initial infection, the analysis defines a reinfection as: 
 - a new positive test 90 days or more after an initial first positive test which was preceded by at least one negative test
 - a new positive test following four consecutive negative tests regardless of the time since the first positive. 
The survey includes individuals from the community population and excludes those in hospitals, care homes, or other institutional settings in the UK.

267,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections increased in people not working in patient-facing healthcare roles
30 June 2021
The percentage of the population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK increased for adults not in patient-facing healthcare job roles (including those not working) in the weeks prior to 14 June 2021.
In contrast, the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 in the UK for adults in patient-facing healthcare job roles remained low. This is after a peak in both groups in January 2021, which was more pronounced for adults in patient-facing job roles than those not in patient-facing healthcare job roles. Patient-facing healthcare job roles include working in healthcare establishments such as hospitals, and do not include job roles in social care or care homes.

All results are provisional and subject to revision.
There are fewer people in patient-facing job roles in our sample than those in non-patient-facing job roles. Therefore, the estimates for patient-facing roles have a larger degree of uncertainty, represented by wider confidence intervals.
This analysis covers the entirety of the UK and is therefore not comparable with analysis published before 20 May 2021, which includes individuals in non-patient and patient-facing job roles by age in England.

In June 2021, 61% of people in the UK who tested positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test reported symptoms within 35 days of the test. People with a strong positive test were more likely to report “classic” symptoms such as cough, fatigue and headache over gastrointestinal symptoms or loss of smell and taste. 
The number of socially distanced and physical contacts reported by adults and school-aged children outside their home has been increasing since March 2021 up to 14 June 2021 across the UK.

25 June 2021
By June 2020, the population of the UK had surpassed 67 million for the first time. However, an increase of 284,000 since June 2019 means growth had slowed to 0.4% - the slowest rate since 2001.
The slowing of the growth rate was due primarily to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. During the first eight months of the year to mid-2020, births, deaths and migration patterns were similar to trends seen in recent years. However, once the first wave of coronavirus hit, the four months from March saw a significant increase in deaths.
The number of deaths in the year to mid-2020 was about 67,000 more than the five-year average - the highest level since 1986. In addition, the number of deaths in the year to mid-2020 was 13% higher than the previous year.
The 701,000 births in mid-2020 represent the lowest number since 2003, continuing the falling trend seen over recent years. Approximately 622,000 people immigrated to the UK while 375,000 emigrated, making net international migration 247,000.

The number of births in mid-2020 was 701,000, the lowest number of births since 2003 and a continuation of the trend in fewer births seen over recent years.

275,"Public sector borrowing in May 2021 was second highest on record after May 2020
22 June 2021
In May 2021, the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income requiring it to borrow £24.3 billion, the second-highest May borrowing on record. 
The public sector is still borrowing a substantial amount to support the economy. While May’s borrowing was only around a half of that in May last year, it was still more than four times that of May 2019. 
Central government receipts were estimated to have increased by £7.5 billion in May 2021 compared with May 2020, reaching £56.9 billion. Of these receipts, taxes were £41.4 billion, £6.0 billion more than in May last year and broadly in line with those of May 2019. 
Central government bodies were estimated to have spent £75.6 billion on day-to-day activities (referred to as current expenditure) in May 2021, £10.6 billion less than a year earlier but £17.3 billion more than in May 2019. Of this, the cost of the government’s coronavirus job support schemes in May, scheduled to close in September 2021, was £5.2 billion, £11.7 billion less than a year earlier. 
In the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021 (April 2020 to March 2021), the UK public sector borrowed £299.2 billion, reduced by £4.0 billion from April’s first provisional estimate but still the highest annual borrowing since records began in FYE March 1946. Official forecasts suggest that borrowing could reach £233.9 billion in FYE March 2022. 
Expressed as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP), public sector net borrowing in FYE March 2021 was 14.3%, the highest such ratio since the end of World War Two, when it was 15.2% in FYE March 1946. 
The recent substantial increase in borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt, which currently stands at 99.2% of GDP, the highest ratio since the 99.5% recorded in March 1962.

276,"No baby boom following initial restrictions for COVID-19
24 June 2021
The number of live births during 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 indicate that there was no baby boom as a result of the restrictions first put in place for the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
During 2020 there were 615,557 live births followed by 146,574 live births in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) of 2021. This is a decrease of 3.9% when compared with 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. This follows the trend of a decline in births observed in recent years. 
The total fertility rate in 2020 was an estimated 1.58 children per woman and 1.53 in the first quarter of 2021; this is in line with the recent trend of a decreasing total fertility rate.
In December 2020 and January 2021, monthly fertility rates decreased steeply when compared with the same months a year ago at 8.2% and 10.1% respectively. Births in these months would have been mostly conceived during the first lockdown in 2020, suggesting there wasn’t a baby boom as a result of restrictions. 
In March 2021, roughly nine months after the easing of lockdown restrictions in Summer 2020, there was an increase of 1.7% in the monthly fertility rate.
There were 2,429 stillbirths in 2020 (167 fewer than 2019) and 618 stillbirths in Quarter 1 2021 (three more than the first quarter in 2020). Stillbirth rates between March 2020 and March 2021 were, for most months, below the five-year average.

277,"Behaviour changes after a year of lockdowns not greatly affected by vaccine status
23 June 2021
The way we live our lives changed considerably after a year of coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns, but whether we had a vaccine dose appears to have had little impact on our behaviour, according to new analysis. 
Longitudinal time-use survey data collected in March and April 2020, and in March 2021, reveal significant changes in behaviour, with more time spent on outdoor activities such as socialising, more homeworking, and less sleep. 
By March of this year, around 30 million people in the UK had received their first vaccine dose, including 92% of those aged 50 years and over. 
However, any differences in behaviour identified between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups at this time appear to have been driven by age or occupation rather than lifestyle changes caused by having had a vaccine dose. 
Those who had not received a vaccine – more likely to be younger and employed outside of healthcare – were working an average of an hour more than they were a year earlier, with little change seen in the vaccinated group. 
General changes in behaviour were more likely to be driven by changes in government policy and adapting to living in a pandemic, regardless of vaccine status. 
For example, those without a vaccine spent 10 more minutes socialising, while those who received a vaccine spent seven more minutes socialising.

",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/howpeoplewithavaccinespenttheirtimeoneyearonfromthefirstuklockdown/greatbritainmarch2021,"How we spent our time changed substantially between the first lockdown (March to April 2020) and March 2021; we spent less time on indoor activities and more on outdoor activities and socialising in person, according to new analysis of Time Use Survey data.
The behavioural changes over this period were largely related to changes in government restrictions and adapting to living in a pandemic, even when factoring in whether someone had a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine dose by March 2021; for example, those without a vaccine spent 10 more minutes socialising, while those who received a vaccine spent 7 more minutes socialising.
The main difference in changes in behaviour from 12 months ago between those with or without a vaccine dose were in changes to time spent working, explained by differences in age and occupation.
Among the non-vaccinated (more likely to be younger and employed in jobs outside of healthcare) there was an increase in time spent working, whereas there was little change for people with at least one vaccine dose.
While most home-based activities shifted back closer to patterns seen before the pandemic (such as watching less TV), we spent more time working from home compared with the first lockdown.
Longer hours spent working may explain why non-vaccinated people were sleeping about 35 minutes less than in the first lockdown; in comparison, those who had received a vaccine slept for a similar amount of time but spent more time resting, possibly as they were recovering from their vaccine.
The impact of schools reopening coincided with the time parents spent on childcare decreasing by over 30%, which appeared to free up more time for working; this change particularly applied to those who had not yet received a vaccine, who were more likely to be parents.
The gender gap in unpaid work was smaller than it was before the start of the pandemic but was still substantial; in March 2021, women spent an average of 56 minutes more time per day on unpaid household work than men.

278,"Retail sales fell 1.4% with declines in food and online spending amid easing of coronavirus restrictions
18 June 2021
Retail sales volumes fell for the first time between April and May 2021 after three consecutive months of growth, with the largest month-on-month declines among food retailers as hospitality reopened. 
The 1.4% fall in overall volumes in Great Britain followed sharp rises in retail sales in April, corresponding with the relaxation of retail restrictions. 
Food stores and non-store retailers saw falls in total sales volumes in May of 5.7% and 4.2% respectively as both sectors were affected by the easing of restrictions for hospitality and non-essential retail. 
Non-food stores continued to report monthly sales volumes growth of 2.3% in May 2021 following growth of 25.6% in April. It signals the continued recovery of one of the sectors most affected by physical store closures during the coronavirus pandemic.
Online spending decreased by 5.7% between April and May, with all sectors, except food stores, reporting monthly falls in their online sales. Feedback from retailers suggested online sales have been affected by the easing of retail restrictions as consumers returned to physical stores. 
This resulted in a decline in the proportion of retail spending online values, which fell to 28.5% from 29.8% in April 2021 – the third consecutive monthly fall in the proportion of online spending. 
The proportion of spending online in May was still significantly higher than the 19.9% reported in February 2020 before the impact of the pandemic, and total retail sales in May were 9.1% higher than pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/may2021,"Retail sales volumes declined by 1.4% between April and May 2021 following a sharp increase in April when retail restrictions were eased; despite the monthly decline, over April and May combined, average total retail sales volumes were still 7.7% higher than in March 2021, and were 9.1% higher than in February 2020 before the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The largest contribution to the monthly decline in May 2021 came from food stores where sales volumes fell by 5.7%; anecdotal evidence suggests the easing of hospitality restrictions had had an impact on sales as people returned to eating and drinking at locations such as restaurants and bars.
Non-food stores reported a 2.3% increase in monthly sales volumes in May 2021 with household goods stores (for example, hardware and furniture stores) and “other” non-food stores reporting the largest growth of 9.0% and 7.7% respectively.
The large increase in sales volumes in April, followed by a relatively small fall in May, has resulted in the volume of sales for the three months to May 2021 being 8.3% higher than in the previous three months; there was strong growth in automotive fuel sales and non-food retailers of 19.3% and 17.8% respectively.
The proportion of retail sales conducted online remains substantially higher than before the pandemic, but in May all retail sectors, with the exception of food stores, reported a fall in their proportions of online sales as consumers returned to physical stores; the total proportion of sales online decreased to 28.5% in May 2021, down from 29.8% in April 2021.
In comparison with February 2020, the value of total online retail sales in May 2021 was 58.8% higher, whereas in-store sales were 1.3% lower.
Retail sales volumes in May 2021 were 24.6% higher than in May 2020, which was affected by the first national lockdown when the tightest restrictions were in place; however, these growth rates are distorted by base effects and are not a reliable guide.

Fewer adults reported maintaining social distancing
18 June 2021
The proportion of adults who said they always or often maintained social distancing with people outside their household fell slightly to 66% in the week ending 13 June 2021, down from 68% the week before. This figure was 88% in the week 24 to 28 March, before the easing of lockdown restrictions around social contact in England at the end of March 2021.
A similar pattern was seen in those who reported avoiding physical contact when outside their household. Just over 7 in 10 (71%) adults avoided physical contact this week, similar to the 72% last week and down from 87% in the period from 24 to 28 March.
The proportion of adults meeting up with someone outside of their household, childcare, or support bubble appeared to fall in the past seven days compared with last week. This may have been because of people returning to work following half-term school holidays in parts of England and Wales. Meeting up outdoors fell slightly from 65% last week to 63%, and meeting indoors fell from 50% to 46%.
Measures of personal well-being remained relatively stable; happiness was at 7.2 out of 10 (7.3 last week). This week's happiness level is equal to the pre-lockdown level recorded in February 2020. Anxiety (3.7 this week, 3.6 last week) and life satisfaction (7.1 this week, 7.0 last week) were also relatively stable but remained below pre-pandemic levels.

Questions: ""Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?"", ""Overall, to what extent do you feel that the things you do in your life are worthwhile?"", ""Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?"", ""Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?"".
These questions are answered on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is ""not at all"" and 10 is ""completely"".

281,"The risk of coronavirus infection after vaccination is highest during the first 21 days then decreases
17 June 2021
Among adult participants in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, the risk of new infection after a first vaccination is highest during the 21 days following their jab, but then it strongly decreases. 
In unadjusted analyses, the risk of infection increased following first vaccination, peaking at around 16 days, followed by a strong decrease to around one month, with a slow but continuous decline. 
Adult participants aged under 40 years had an increased risk of positivity post vaccination than older age groups. 
Those working in patient-facing healthcare roles and in care homes, living in larger households, or in areas of greater deprivation also had higher rates of positivity following vaccination. 
The analyses apply only to participants in the survey and have not been adjusted to be representative of the population or infection rates at the time.

All estimates are subject to uncertainty, given that a sample is only part of the wider population.
A confidence interval gives an indication of the degree of uncertainty of an estimate, showing the precision of a sample estimate. The 95% confidence intervals are calculated so that if we repeated the study many times, 95% of the time the true unknown value would lie between the lower and upper confidence limits. A wider interval indicates more uncertainty in the estimate.

Those who became infected post vaccination were less likely to have symptoms and less likely to have a high viral load compared with individuals who tested positive but have not been vaccinated.
Characteristics linked to an increased risk of positivity post vaccination include individuals aged under 40 years, individuals working in patient-facing healthcare roles and in care homes, larger household size and greater deprivation; there was a trend towards lower positivity rates post-vaccination in rural areas.
Ongoing monitoring of infection post vaccination is essential.

283,"The proportion of the UK workforce on furlough leave is at its lowest level since the coronavirus pandemic began
17 June 2021
The proportion of businesses’ workforce on furlough leave has fallen to 6.5% in late May 2021, down from 19.9% in late January 2021 and 8.1% in early May 2021 and coinciding with the easing of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. This is the lowest recorded proportion recorded since the pandemic began. 
The proportion of UK businesses currently trading has remained stable at 87% in early June 2021, the same as in late May 2021 and the highest proportion since comparable estimates began in June 2020. A further 2% of businesses intend to restart trading in the next two weeks according to the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (Wave 32).
In terms of trade, the proportion of currently trading businesses experiencing a challenge in importing and exporting increased from December 2020 until January 2021, to over 50%, and has remained broadly stable since then. A greater proportion of businesses are experiencing challenges in importing than in exporting.

284,"April 2021 saw UK’s average house price decrease after reaching a record level in March 2021
16 June 2021
The UK’s average house price increased by 8.9% over the year to stand at £251,000 in April 2021, down from a peak of £256,000 in March 2021. 
The temporary changes to Stamp Duty, Land and Buildings Transaction Tax and Land Transaction Tax, introduced because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, may have allowed sellers to request higher prices as buyers’ overall costs are reduced. Because these changes were initially due to conclude at the end of March, it’s likely this inflated last month's figures as buyers rushed to ensure their house purchases were scheduled to complete ahead of this deadline.
Private rental prices paid by tenants in the UK rose by 1.2% in the 12 months to May 2021, unchanged since the 12 months to April 2021. The beginning of 2021 has seen a slowdown in rental price growth, which has been driven by prices in London.
London’s rental price growth in May 2021 (negative 0.1%) is lower than any other English region. This may reflect both a decrease in demand, such as remote working shifting housing preferences meaning workers no longer need to be close to their offices, and an increase in supply, such as an excess supply of rental properties as short-term lets change to long-term lets.

15 June 2021
Early estimates for May 2021 indicate that there were 28.5 million payrolled employees. The number of payrolled employees has increased for the sixth consecutive month but remains 553,000 below pre-pandemic levels. Since February 2020, the largest falls in payrolled employment have been in the accommodation and food services sector among those aged 25 years and under and those living in London. 
Following a period of employment growth and low unemployment, since the start of the pandemic employment has generally been decreasing and unemployment increasing. However, the latest estimates for February to April 2021, from our Labour Force Survey, continue to show signs of recovery, with a quarterly increase in the employment rate. 
With the relaxation of many coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions, total hours worked increased on the quarter, however it’s still below pre-pandemic levels. The redundancy rate decreased on the quarter and is now similar to pre-pandemic levels.

The strongest quarterly increase was in accommodation and food services. In May 2021, the experimental monthly vacancies data, and the experimental Adzuna online vacancies data both surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
Annual growth in average employee pay has continued to increase, however this is driven by compositional effects of a fall in the number and proportion of lower-paid employee jobs and because the latest month is now compared with April 2020 when earnings were first affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (the base effect). Growth in average total pay (including bonuses) and regular pay (excluding bonuses) among employees was 5.6% for the three months February to April 2021.

289,"Confidence in pub and bar survival is starting to improve
8 June 2021
There has been a revival of confidence among pub and bar owners about the survival of their business beyond the next three months.
Following the introduction of a national lockdown in the UK and the closure of pubs and bars, the proportion of pub owners who had ""high confidence"" that their businesses would survive dropped to its lowest recorded level of 1% in late January 2021.
The most recent data for early May 2021 showed 24% of pub and bar owners had “high confidence”.
Levels of “low confidence” dropped from 63% in October 2020 to 3% by April 2021, but, by the end of the month, had risen significantly to 19%. 
The percentage of pub and bar staff on furlough shows a downward trend since restrictions were lifted on beer gardens, however, remains high. This may be due to pubs and bars operating with minimal staff since reopening. As of mid May, 55% of pub and bar staff were still furloughed. This compares with 8% of staff on furlough for all other businesses in May 2021.

Our pub is financially hanging on by a thread.
While the return of “high confidence” has shown promising signs of recovery, the drop in the number of pub and bar bosses who felt “low confidence” in the ability of their business to survive the next three months failed to last.
That “low confidence” dropped from 63% in November 2020 to 3% by April 2021, but by early May 2021, had risen significantly to 19%.
Confidence among pub and bar owners has been both considerably lower and less stable, than that of other business owners.
Prior to the pandemic, employment in pubs and bars (particularly pub chains) was increasing, as we showed in our previous Economies of ale article. Given the interruptions to trade in 2020, it’s likely that staffing levels will have changed significantly. Wider reports from those representing the hospitality industries suggest jobs may have been lost during the pandemic, with workers retraining for other industries.
The government’s HM Revenue and Customs Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), also known as furlough, has been an important means of business support during the pandemic. It has enabled landlords to keep staff on their books while their establishments have been closed.

While the furlough scheme has been a means of survival, it’s pointless if they have no job to come back to.
At its peak in the November 2020 lockdown, 91% of pub and bar staff were on furlough. This number has now decreased to 55%.
This compares with overall 8% to 15% of staff on furlough in all other businesses during the same period, indicating the heavier reliance of pubs and bars on the scheme.
We can increasingly see a downward trend of pub and bar staff on furlough since restrictions were lifted on beer gardens. Despite this, the percentage of staff that were on furlough has remained high. This suggests that where pubs and bars have been open, they have been operating with minimal staff.

Not all pub and bar jobs will have been saved by the furlough scheme. In the weeks just after Christmas 2020, 12% of pubs and bars reported that it was likely they would make redundancies in the next three months. This number fell to approximately 4% by late February 2021. It is unclear whether this is because of increased certainty or because the redundancies had already gone through.

11 June 2021
When asked about their plans for the summer, 12% of adults said they planned to go on a trip abroad before September 2021. Younger adults were more likely to have such plans, with 16% of 30- to 49-year-olds expecting to leave the country, compared with 8% aged over 70 years. 
Of those planning a trip abroad, 71% want to go away on holiday, 34% hope to visit family and friends, and just 4% plan to travel for work.
Most of those planning to travel outside of the UK said they were willing to wear a face covering (91%) or prove being vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus (86%). However, fewer people were willing to quarantine when arriving home (25%) or pay for or stay in a managed quarantine hotel (2%).

Question: ""Which of the following would you be willing to carry out when going on a trip abroad?”
Base: adults who said they planned a trip abroad before September.

Fewer people now maintain social distancing with people outside their household (68% compared with 74% last week). This figure has been falling since the easing of lockdown restrictions in England on 12 April (88% in early April).
Measures of happiness rose to 7.3 out of 10 – higher than the pre-lockdown levels recorded in February 2020 (7.2) and the highest score since May last year (7.4). Anxiety levels improved slightly from 3.8 last week to 3.6 out of 10, while overall life satisfaction levels were similar to last week (from 7.1 to 7.0 out of 10 this week). 
 - Latest bulletin on the social impacts of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Great Britain
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/11june2021,"This week, over the period 2 to 6 June 2021, based on adults in Great Britain:
The proportion of adults maintaining social distancing with people outside their household fell to 68% from 74% last week; this is a continued fall from 88% in early April (7 to 11 April 2021) before the easing of lockdown restrictions in England from 12 April 2021.
Fewer adults reported avoiding physical contact when outside their home in the last seven days (72% this week, 73% last week) than before the easing of lockdown, which was at 85% in the period 7 to 11 April 2021.
The proportion of adults meeting up indoors with someone not in their household, childcare or support bubble in the last seven days reached 50% last week and remained unchanged this week following the ease of lockdown restrictions across Great Britain.
The proportion of adults meeting up outdoors increased to 65% from 53% last week, possibly helped by the sunny weather in addition to the half-term school holidays for some in England and Wales.
Personal well-being measures of happiness (7.3) increased to above February 2020's pre-pandemic level (7.2) for the first time since May 2020 (7.4); anxiety levels (3.6) also improved slightly from last week (3.8), while levels of life satisfaction (7.0 this week, 7.1 last week) and feeling that things done in life are worthwhile (7.3 this week, 7.4 last week) were at similar levels to last week.
Around 8 in 10 (80%) adults reported to have received at least one dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine (78% last week), which includes around 55% of adults reporting to have received their second dose (50% last week).

291,"All but one of the top 20 countries for visiting friends and relatives over summer are on current amber and red lists
10 June 2021
More than 5 million visits that UK residents would normally have made to see friends and relatives overseas this summer (July to September 2021) would currently require quarantine and coronavirus (COVID-19) tests on return. 
Different countries are classed as red, amber or green based on whether people should travel to them and if quarantine is required because of coronavirus restrictions.
Restrictions will likely reduce the amount of money spent by UK residents overseas compared with a pre-pandemic summer, as well as the amount spent by overseas residents who would have visited the UK.
The red, amber and green lists are reviewed regularly with countries' status changing depending on the coronavirus situation. The analysis in our article is based on the lists as of 8 June 2021.
 - Article on red, amber and green travel lists and overseas visits from the UK
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/articles/redamberandgreentravellistsandoverseasvisitsfromtheuk/2021-06-10,"In an average pre-pandemic summer, UK residents made almost 6.6 million visits to see friends and family overseas. How could these trips be affected by the current red and amber travel lists, and what might the financial impact be?
10 June 2021
More than 5 million visits that UK residents would normally have made to see friends and relatives overseas this summer (July to September 2021) would currently require quarantine and coronavirus (COVID-19) tests on return. 
Different countries are classed as red, amber or green based on whether people should travel to them and if quarantine is required because of coronavirus restrictions. 
Restrictions will likely reduce the amount of money spent by UK residents overseas compared with a pre-pandemic summer, as well as the amount spent by overseas residents who would have visited the UK. 
In Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2020, when there were restrictions on social contact but travel corridors permitted overseas journeys to a list of countries, visits by UK residents to see friends and family abroad fell by 78% compared with the same three months of 2019. 
The red, amber and green lists are reviewed regularly with countries' status changing depending on the coronavirus situation. The analysis in this article is based on the lists as of 8 June 2021.
Data for top 20 countries for visits to see friends and relatives (XLSX, 18 KB)
During Quarter 3 between 2016 and 2019, an average of more than 5 million visits by UK residents overseas were to friends and relatives in countries now on the amber or red lists, according to analysis of data from the International Passenger Survey. This means at least 80% of visits to friends and relatives would now require quarantine and COVID-19 tests on return to the UK. The UK government is telling people they should not travel to countries on the red or amber lists. 
The true figure will be higher because the red, amber and green lists include countries where data on visits are grouped due to small numbers. These are listed in the data as, for example, “Other Africa”, “Other Asia”, etc. Visits to see friends and relatives in these groups of countries came to an average of just over 684,000 each summer, accounting for around 10% of visits for this purpose. 
The nations of the UK have their own red, amber and green lists, which are currently identical. People who visit countries on green lists do not have to quarantine on returning to the UK. However, other countries also have their own restrictions on whether or not they would allow UK residents to visit, including with or without quarantine. 
The Republic of Ireland is the only country in the top 20 for visiting friends and relatives where quarantine is not required on returning to the UK. This is because it is part of the Common Travel Area, along with the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. 
Between 2016 and 2019, 29% of all overseas residents’ visits to the UK during Quarter 3 were to visit friends and relatives while 23% of UK residents’ visits to other countries were for the same reason. 
This made visiting friends and relatives the second most common reason for foreign travel, after holidays. Around 44% of overseas residents’ visits to the UK was for holidays compared with 69% of UK residents’ visits overseas. 
Data for top 20 countries for total visits by UK residents (XLSX, 18 KB)
UK residents made an average of 6.3 million visits to Spain, for any reason (holidays, visiting friends and relatives, business or study) during Quarter 3 between 2016 and 2019. This made Spain by far the most popular summer destination for UK residents. 
The second most popular was France, with 3.6 million visits. Both countries are on the amber list as of 8 June 2021. 
Australia is the most popular destination on the current green list, with an average of 99,000 visits by UK residents during a non-pandemic summer. The most popular destination previously on the green list was Portugal, with an average of 1.2 million visits by UK residents each third quarter. Portugal was removed from the green list with effect from 8 June 2021. 
In 2020, as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in travel restrictions, UK residents made an estimated 23.8 million visits abroad, a fall of 74% on the year before. 
Data for 20 countries where UK residents spent the most during a typical summer (XLSX, 18 KB)
It is not possible to say how much of the money that was previously spent overseas by UK residents, or by overseas residents in the UK, would have been spent in 2021 had there been no restrictions. 
Furlough, job losses, restrictions and concerns about the risk of travel will all have played a part. 
During 2019, UK residents spent a total of £62 billion overseas. This is more than double the £28 billion spent in the UK by overseas residents. In 2020, spending by overseas residents in the UK fell 78% to just over £6 billion, while spending by UK residents overseas fell 78% to just under £14 billion. 
During a pre-pandemic summer (Quarter 3 2016 to 2019), more than 20p in every £1 spent abroad by UK visitors was in Spain. 
On average, more than £4 billion was spent each summer in Spain by UK visitors, followed by almost £1.9 billion in the USA and in France. 
Data for percentage point difference in hotel room occupancy in England (XLSX, 18 KB)
Hotels had been allowed to re-open to all guests in July of 2020 following the first lockdown, but by August room occupancy in every region of England was down on the same month of 2019, according to data from VisitEngland. 
The South West saw the lowest year on year fall in England in terms of hotel room occupancy during August 2020. VisitEngland data suggest 72% of available rooms were occupied that month in the South West region, down 15 percentage points year on year from 87% in August 2019. 
Greater London faced the biggest fall, with hotel room occupancy in August recovering only to 30%, down 56 percentage points on the same month of 2019 (86%). 
Data for indexed seasonally-adjusted total turnover in accommodation sub-industries (XLSX, 28 KB)
Camping, however, proved popular and surpassed its performance in the previous year. There was even an increase in turnover for the camping sub-industry in December, following the end of England’s second lockdown and before the start of the third in January 2021. 
Our regular bulletin on the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, due to be released on 11 June 2021, will include analysis on whether or not adults in Great Britain intend to travel overseas in the next six months. 
The figures relate to the number of completed visits, not the number of visitors. Anyone entering or leaving more than once in the same period is counted on each visit. 
An overseas visitor is a person who, being permanently resident in a country outside the UK, visits the UK for a period of less than 12 months. UK citizens resident overseas for 12 months or more coming home on leave are included in this category. Visits abroad are visits for a period of less than 12 months by people permanently resident in the UK (who may be of foreign nationality). 
Spend is assigned to the country where the majority of the visit took place. For example, if someone travelled to Spain via France, the entirety of the overseas spend is assigned to Spain.

292,"Lower rough sleeping levels recorded in pandemic snapshots than in previous years
10 June 2021
Snapshot estimates of rough sleeping levels in England and Northern Ireland were lower in 2020 than in previous years. 
The lower figures (which estimate the number of people sleeping rough on a single night in autumn in each country) may be related to policy responses, including the provision of emergency accommodation to people at risk of rough sleeping during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
In England, the estimated number of people sleeping rough on a single night in autumn fell from 4,266 in 2019 to 2,688 in 2020. In Northern Ireland, the estimate fell from 36 to 18 during the same period. Snapshot estimates do not measure the number of people who may have experienced rough sleeping over an extended period.
Comparable figures for Wales are not available for 2020, as the annual survey was suspended. Alternative Welsh Government sources report lower numbers of people sleeping rough in Wales in 2021 and 2020 than the estimate for a single night in autumn 2019 though they are not directly comparable sources. No snapshot is conducted in Scotland.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has brought together official statistics published across the UK by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), and the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to present a picture of rough sleeping. 
 - Article on rough sleeping in the UK
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/roughsleepingintheuk/2002to2021,"Homelessness policy is devolved across the UK and each country produces data and statistics on rough sleeping according to their own legislative framework; the different approaches prevent direct comparison between each country's statistics.
Because of the different methods and statistics, it is difficult to definitively report trends on rough sleeping for the UK as a whole.
Trends in rough sleeping levels in each country of the UK vary, with recent peaks in either 2017 or 2018.
In 2020, snapshot estimates of rough sleeping levels were lower than previous years, possibly related to policy responses, including providing emergency accommodation during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to people who sleep rough.
Statistics indicate that more people who sleep rough in the UK are men, with an overall population ratio of around six men to one woman.
Because of the challenges in identifying people who sleep rough in data collections, all topic statistics are estimates, providing general insight into the scale and characteristics of this population.

293,"Unpaid carers concerned about impact of pandemic on daily life
10 June 2021
The majority of people providing unpaid care to someone else worry about the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on their daily life (63% compared with 56% for non-carers). 
“Unpaid carers” are people aged 16 years and over who cared for someone in the last seven days because they had long-term physical or mental health conditions or illnesses, or problems related to old age, excluding anything they did as their paid employment. 
Results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey from 31 March 2021 to 25 April 2021 found that around one third of unpaid carers (31%) lived with someone who was sick, disabled or over the age of 70 years who they looked after or gave special help to (compared with 4% of non-carers). 
More unpaid carers than non-carers said coronavirus had affected their life in the following ways: 
 - life events (for example, weddings and funerals) (44% unpaid carers compared with 40% non-carers)
 - work (30% compared with 26%)
 - access to healthcare and treatment for non-coronavirus-related issues (30% compared with 20%)
 - health (16% compared with 13%)
 - caring responsibilities (16% compared with 3%)
 - access to groceries, medication and essentials (15% compared with 10%)
More women (57%) provided unpaid care than men (43%) but there were no significant differences between men and women in the number of hours, or type of care provided. 
On average, unpaid carers were older (52 years) than non-carers (47 years). Unpaid carers were also more likely to report that they were disabled (32% compared with 23% for non-carers).

More women (57%) provided unpaid care than men (43%); however, there were no significant differences between men and women in the number of hours, or type of care provided.
A higher percentage of unpaid carers than non-carers reported that they were disabled (32% compared with 23%), with unpaid carers aged 16 to 34 years and 45 to 54 years more likely to be disabled than non-carers of the same age groups.
A larger proportion of unpaid carers than non-carers were worried about the effects that the coronavirus pandemic was having on their life (63% compared with 56%).
More than half of unpaid carers (57%) had received their first vaccine, and a fifth (20%) had received both doses. Fewer non-carers had received their first dose (44%) or had received both doses (16%), however, on average unpaid carers were older (52 years) than non-carers (47 years).
There were no statistically significant differences between the percentage of unpaid carers who worked compared with non-carers, however, unpaid carers were more likely to work part-time (31%) than non-carers (25%).

294,"45% of clinically extremely vulnerable people still shielding
8 June 2021
Almost half of the 3.7 million people in England described as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) are continuing to shield from the coronavirus (COVID-19), despite not being advised to anymore. 
When asked between 17 and 22 May 2021, 45% of CEV people said they were shielding; this is similar to the previous estimate (50% still shielding, 26 April to 1 May 2021).
Shielding is a voluntary action in which the individual stays in their home or garden as much as possible, except for leaving their household to attend essential medical appointments or for exercise. The advice to shield was paused from 1 April 2021.
Of the CEV people who reported being aware that the advice to shield had paused, 92% reported that they followed the new guidance completely or quite closely. 
The data also showed that 84% of CEV people had received two doses of a vaccine when asked between 17 and 22 May 2021. This compares with 67% when asked between 26 April and 1 May 2021. 
The data also showed that 96% of CEV people had received at least one dose of the vaccine.

295,"Rates of receiving a second dose of a coronavirus vaccine were lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population
7 June 2021
Among people aged 70 years and over in England, 96.0% of those who had received a first dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine by 15 March 2021 had gone on to receive a second dose within the next eight weeks (by 9 May 2021). 
However, some of the groups previously found to be less likely to have received a first dose of a vaccine were also less likely to have gone on to receive a second dose. 
Those from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds had the lowest rates of going on to receive a second dose among ethnic groups, at 82.4% and 82.7% respectively. The White British population had the highest rate of receiving a second dose. 
People living in more deprived areas had lower second dose vaccination rates than those living in less deprived neighbourhoods, while disabled people reporting being “limited a lot” in their day-to-day activities had lower rates of receiving a second dose than non-disabled people.

Previously reported disparities in first dose vaccination rates by socio-demographic factor were also observed in the proportion of those who went on to receive a second dose.
While first dose vaccination rates were lowest for people identifying as Black Caribbean and Black African, those from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds had the lowest rates of receiving a second dose, with 82.4% and 82.7% of those who received their first dose going on to receive their second dose respectively; the White British group had the highest rate of receiving a second dose.
Among those who received a first dose, only 84.7% of those identifying as Muslim received a second dose.
People who do not have English as their main language were less likely to have received their first and second dose of a vaccine than native speakers and had substantially lower rates of continuing to a second dose.
People living in more deprived areas had lower first dose vaccination and second dose vaccination rates; among those who received a first dose, 93.3% of those in the most deprived areas received a second dose, compared with 97.2% in the least deprived areas.
We observed lower second dose rates in less advantaged socio-economic groups; those with no qualifications and those who do not own their own home were less likely than their more advantaged counterparts to continue to a second dose.
As observed in first dose vaccination rates, disabled people reporting being ""limited a lot"" in their day-to-day activities had lower second dose vaccination rates (93.1%) than non-disabled people (96.6%).

297,"More than one in five accommodation and food service businesses reopened in the second half of May 2021
3 June 2021
As coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions continue to ease across the UK, there were further increases in the proportion of businesses trading and declines in the proportion of the workforce on furlough leave in May 2021. 
The proportion of UK businesses currently trading has increased to 87% in the second half of May 2021, the highest proportion since comparable estimates began in June 2020. A further 3% of businesses intend to restart trading in the next two weeks according to the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (Wave 31). 
In comparison, the proportion of businesses’ workforce on furlough leave has fallen to 8% in the first half of May 2021. This is comparable with the lowest recorded proportion in October 2020. 
Focusing on the accommodation and food service activities industry, one of the industries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic: 
 - the percentage of businesses currently trading has risen from 61% in the first half of May to 83% in the second half of May 2021
 - the proportions of businesses’ workforce on furlough leave has fallen from 31% in late April to early May to 21% in the first half of May 2021 
These changes are likely because of the further relaxation of coronavirus regulations on 17 May 2021 (24 May for Northern Ireland), allowing indoor dining.

Of such households, about three in five (59%) had all members aged 16 years and over in employment during the period January to March 2021. This figure is down 1.4 percentage points compared with the same period in 2020.
Approximately 3 in 10 (27.6%) such households had a mix of at least one working and one workless adult, up 1.8 percentage points compared with the same period last year.
Data from the Labour Force Survey suggest about one in seven (13.4%) households had no members in employment, down 0.3 percentage points compared with the year before.

No difference in self-isolation adherence between deprivation groups after a positive COVID-19 test
2 June 2021
A majority of people required to self-isolate in England after a positive coronavirus (COVID-19) test report following the requirements fully, as new data show no difference in isolation rates according to deprivation.
Data collected between 10 and 15 May show 86% of those required to self-isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reported fully adhering to the requirements throughout their self-isolation period.
This is the first time adherence has been reported by Index of Multiple Deprivation groups - a measure of relative deprivation across England. The data show no statistically significant difference in the proportion of people who report full adherence to self-isolation between deprivation levels.
Over the same period, over a third of those who tested positive (37%) reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their mental health and well-being.
Around one in four people (27%) reported having lost income because of self-isolation.
Adherence to self-isolation requirements was 98% in the first 24 hours after receiving a positive test result and 96% for the remainder of the isolation period. These are statistically significantly higher rates of adherence than those self-isolating between the onset of symptoms and a positive test result (84%).

The economy grew by 2.1% in March 2021
12 May 2021
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by 2.1% in March 2021, the fastest monthly growth since August 2020, as schools in some parts of the UK reopened throughout the month.
The output approach to GDP shows that March’s level is 5.9% below the levels seen in February 2020, and 1.1% below the initial recovery peak in October 2020.
Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 1.5% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020, following 1.3% growth in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020. 
The service sector grew by 1.9% in March 2021, with schools re-opening across England and Wales and retail trade sales continuing to show strength. However, despite this growth, education output in March 2021 remained 3.9% below its December 2020 level, when schools were last fully open before the latest coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were introduced across the UK.
Output in human health and social work activities grew 1.7% in March 2021, following revised growth of 0.7% in February and negative 0.7% in January. This gradual pick up in health in the first three months of 2021 is driven by the NHS Test and Trace service and COVID-19 vaccination across the UK.
Output in the production sector grew by 1.8% in March 2021, as manufacturing grew for a second consecutive month, at 2.1%.
The construction sector grew by 5.8% in March 2021, driven by growth in both new work and repair and maintenance. The growth in construction (and indeed manufacturing) reflects businesses continuing to adapt, including development of COVID-19 secure environments in which to operate.

301,"Borrowing in April 2021 fell compared with a year earlier, but was still the second-highest since records began
25 May 2021
In April 2021, the UK public sector borrowed £31.7 billion. This is the second-highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, £15.6 billion less than in April 2020. 
Central government receipts were estimated to have increased by £3.8 billion in April 2021 compared with April 2020, reaching £58.0 billion, including £42.5 billion in tax receipts. 
Central government bodies are estimated to have spent £83.9 billion on day-to-day activities (referred to as current expenditure) in April 2021, £15.5 billion less than a year earlier. Of this, £5.5 billion reflects the cost of the coronavirus job support schemes (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and Self-employment Income Support Scheme), £4.5 billion less than a year earlier. 
In the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021, the UK public sector borrowed £300.3 billion, revised down by £2.8 billion from last month’s first provisional estimate. This remains the highest borrowing since records began in FYE March 1946. 
Expressed as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP), public sector net borrowing in FYE March 2021 was 14.3%, revised down by 0.2 percentage points from last month’s first provisional estimate. It remains the highest such ratio since the end of World War Two, when it was 15.2% in FYE March 1946. 
On a like-for-like basis, borrowing in the FYE March 2021 was £27.1 billion less than the official forecast made by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR expects that borrowing could reach £233.9 billion in the FYE March 2022. 
This substantial increase in borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt which currently stands at 98.5% of GDP, the highest ratio since the 99.5% that was recorded in March 1962.

302,"The reduction in the UK’s total trade in goods has been greater with EU countries than non-EU countries
25 May 2021
UK total trade in goods (imports plus exports) with EU countries decreased by 23.1% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021 compared to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2018. This was because goods exports fell by 24.0% and imports by 22.5%. Total trade in goods with non-EU countries fell by a much smaller 0.8% in the same period. 
Total goods trade with EU countries reduced by 20.3% between Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 and Quarter 1 2021. Stockpiling both in the UK and in the EU prior to the end of the EU transition period on 1 January 2021 may have contributed to this. Total goods trade with non-EU countries reduced by a lesser 0.4%. 
Evidence from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) shows that, of currently trading businesses that have reported challenges at the end of February 2021, many businesses reported that the end of the EU transition period was a challenge in importing and/or exporting in this period, more so than the pandemic. 
Of the UK’s five largest import partners, only goods imports from China have increased between Quarter 1 2018 and Quarter 1 2021. The 59% growth in imports over this period is in part likely because of China’s exports not being as affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as other countries, and increased demand for electronics and textiles with the latter being caused by increased demand for personal protective equipment (PPE).

304,"Retail sales continue to rise above pre-pandemic levels
21 May 2021
Both the quantity bought and the amount spent in retailers in Great Britain increased 9.2% in April 2021 compared with March. This reflects the effect of the easing of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions including the re-opening of all non-essential retail from 12 April in England and Wales and from 26 April in Scotland. 
Overall, sales volumes and values continued to rise above pre-pandemic levels (February 2020), although this recovery was not felt equally among sectors. Automotive fuel retailers continue to record sales lower than pre-pandemic levels, down 13.3% when compared with two years previously, as home working and reduced travel continues to impact the sector. 
Non-store retailing was the sector to report the largest growth of 56.0% when compared with April 2019, although all other sectors reported a fall in their proportions of online sales as physical stores re-opened during April.

307,"People who live in London are more likely to report lower levels of happiness than those who live in the rest of the UK
26 May 2021
Data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) suggests that average happiness in England and Wales was lower in all periods between March 2020 and March 2021 than in February 2020. 
Subnational analysis shows that adults in London reported lower levels of happiness than other areas of the country, whereas happiness in rural areas was higher on average across all periods compared with urban areas. 
Regression analysis suggests that out of the factors analysed, respondents feeling lonely at least some of the time had the greatest impact on feelings of happiness. Adults in rural areas experienced the greatest impact on their level of happiness as a result of loneliness, although a higher percentage of people in urban areas felt lonely. 
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has played a part in peoples’ levels of happiness. Respondents who felt uncomfortable leaving home reported lower levels of happiness than those who were comfortable leaving home. 
Furthermore, people who were unsure on how to best protect themselves against COVID-19 reported lower happiness levels, with the highest proportion of uninformed people being in London (4%). 
Analysis 
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandcontributorstosubnationalwellbeing/januarytomarch2021,"Over the past year, average happiness for England and Wales was lower than the pre-pandemic (February 2020) average of 7.2; London recorded lower average happiness than rural areas or other urban areas, dropping to a low of 6.5 in early 2021. 
Reported loneliness was found to have the strongest association to happiness of any other factor considered; lonely adults were likely to report lower happiness scores than less lonely adults, with London having the largest proportion of adults who felt lonely at least some of the time (29%). 
Adults in urban areas (including London) who had worked from home over the last seven days were more likely to report lower levels of happiness than those who had not worked from home. 
When compared with the baseline of respondents aged 75 years or over, all younger adults across all areas had significantly lower levels of happiness; this indicates that people over the age of 75 years are most likely to report the highest level of happiness, especially compared with those aged 35 to 44 years.

309,"Student life satisfaction improves as socialising increases
24 May 2021
Average life satisfaction scores for students in England continued to improve for students in May 2021, following rises in life satisfaction in April, as restrictions began to lift. However, the average life satisfaction scores for students (5.8 out of 10) are still statistically significantly lower than the rest of the adult population (7.0 out of 10). 

Estimates for “University students” are calculated from the Student COVID-19 Insights Survey (SCIS) for students at universities in England, between 4 and 12 May 2021 (See Glossary).
Estimates for the “Adult population in Great Britian” are calculated from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (COVID-19 module) for adults in Great Britain, between 28 April and 3 May 2021.
These two surveys have different data collection methods, therefore they should not be compared directly but can be considered in reference to each other.

Between May 4 and 12 2021, the proportion of students reporting leaving home for recreational purposes or exercise, go to work and travel to different areas all increased compared with previous months. The proportion of students reporting limiting their social contact to household, support bubble or childcare bubble also declined. 
Almost half (47%) of students that left the house in the previous seven days reported they had met up with family or friends they don’t live with indoors; this was more than double who reported the same in March 2021 (21%). However, the proportion of students reporting having taken at least one COVID-19 test in the last seven days (whether or not they had symptoms) was also higher than in April 2021.

310,"UK online job adverts in catering and hospitality rise above pre-pandemic levels
13 May 2021
UK online job adverts for “catering and hospitality” roles were above pre-pandemic levels, at 103% of their February 2020 average on 7 May 2021.
According to Adzuna, the volume of online job adverts for catering and hospitality has increased by 46 percentage points since 9 April 2021, a strong upward trend coinciding with the recent easing of hospitality restrictions across the UK.

Further category breakdowns are included in the  Online job advert estimates dataset and more details on the methodology can be found in  Using Adzuna data to derive an indicator of weekly vacancies.

Catering and hospitality online job adverts saw the largest fortnightly increase of all categories on 7 May 2021 (22 percentage points) when compared with 22 April 2021. Within the same period, another notable increase was seen in “transport, logistics and warehouse”, which was 18 percentage points higher than a fortnight ago, at 235% of its February 2020 average level on 7 May 2021. 
Overall, total UK online job adverts were at 107% of their February 2020 average level on 7 May 2021, an increase of 4 percentage points from a fortnight ago. This marks the first time there have been more online job adverts than there were for the same period in 2019.

311,"People and social impacts
Measures such as no social distancing and wearing a face covering made adults less likely to want to attend an organised event
14 May 2021
The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey asked people in Great Britain about attending events, such as sports matches, the cinema, theatre, or a musical performance.
Just over 7 in 10 (71%) adults said they would be less likely to attend an event if they had to spend an extra two hours in the venue for a socially distanced exit. People also said they would be less likely to attend an event if they had to wear a face covering, they were unable to buy food or if there were no social distancing measures in place. 
Around 4 in 10 (41%) adults said they were more likely to attend an event if they were required to show proof of a negative coronavirus (COVID-19) test.

Base: all adults.
Questions:

 - “Compared to before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, how much more or less likely would you be to go to an organised event if no social distancing measures were in place?”
 - “Compared to before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, how much more or less likely would you be to go to an organised event if you needed to have proof of a recent negative coronavirus (COVID-19) test?“
 - “Compared to before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, how much more or less likely would you be to go to a large organised event if you had to spend an extra two hours in the venue so that people could stay socially distanced when leaving?”
 - “Compared to before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, how much more or less likely would you be to go to a two-hour event if you had to wear a face covering?“
 - “Compared to before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, how much more or less likely would you be to go to a two-hour event if you were not allowed to buy or eat food?”.

312,"Coronavirus lockdowns drove fall in recorded crime across England and Wales in 2020
13 May 2021
Recorded crime in England and Wales fell by 8% in the 12 months to December 2020, driven by substantial reductions during coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown restrictions.
Approximately 5.6 million offences were recorded, with reductions in most crime types – including a 26% fall in theft offences.
Offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime) fell by 9%, largely because of a 29% decrease in knife-enabled robbery offences. Across London, knife-enabled crime fell by 21% compared with 2019.
However, the number of domestic abuse-related offences recorded by police rose by 7% compared with 2019. A 15% rise in drug offences reflected proactive police activity in crime hotspots during lockdown.
Data download
Recorded offences fluctuated alongside coronavirus restrictions. October to December 2020 saw a 7% decrease in recorded crime compared with the previous three months, as measures were tightened across England and Wales.
It follows a 15% fall in April to June 2020 as the first lockdown was imposed, and a 19% rise in July to September 2020, as restrictions were eased over the summer.
In 2020, the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales showed there were 12 million offences, including 3.1 million theft, and 4.5 million fraud offences.

Total police recorded crime decreased by 8% to approximately 5.6 million offences, driven by falls during the periods of national lockdown, particularly April to June 2020 and mainly theft offences.
There was an 11% fall in offences involving firearms and 9% fall in offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime), driven by substantial decreases in the April to June 2020 period.
The number of homicides decreased by 12%, however, when the single incident that took place in Grays, Essex, in October 2019, when the bodies of 39 migrants were found in a lorry is excluded, homicides show a 6% decrease (625 offences).

313,"Deaths at home increased by a third in 2020, while deaths in hospitals fell except for COVID-19
7 May 2021
Deaths in private homes, from all causes, were one-third higher in 2020 than in the previous five years. There were around 167,000 deaths from all causes in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with an average of 125,000 between 2015 and 2019. 
The majority of deaths due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) (where the coronavirus was the main cause) occurred in hospitals and care homes, while many deaths from other causes happened in private homes. 
Our first release of the finalised mortality data for 2020 shows that “excess deaths” from all causes were 14% above the five-year average in England and Wales, with COVID-19 being the main reason for excess deaths.
Excess deaths are the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Using the average gives us a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a ""usual"" year, before the coronavirus pandemic. 
There were almost 76,000 more deaths from all causes and in all locations (hospitals, care homes, private homes and elsewhere) in England and Wales in 2020 than the five-year average.

Deaths in private homes, from all causes, were one-third higher in 2020 than in the previous five years. There were around 167,000 deaths from all causes in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with an average of 125,000 between 2015 and 2019. 
The majority of deaths due to COVID-19 (where the coronavirus was the main cause) occurred in hospitals and care homes, while many deaths from other causes, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, happened in private homes. Our analysis shows that many of these deaths at home were people who, in a non-pandemic year, may have typically died elsewhere such as in hospital. 
Deaths in hospital were 4% above the five-year average. However, if deaths due to COVID-19 are excluded, then deaths in hospitals would have been 16% lower than the average. 
Our first release of the finalised mortality data for 2020 shows that “excess deaths” from all causes were 14% above the five-year average in England and Wales, with the coronavirus (COVID-19) being the main reason for excess deaths. 
Excess deaths are the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Using the average gives us a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a ""usual"" year, before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
There were almost 76,000 more deaths from all causes and in all locations (hospitals, care homes, private homes and elsewhere) in England and Wales in 2020 than the five-year average. COVID-19 was responsible for 97% of the excess, having not previously existed. 
This analysis looks at England and Wales as a whole; trends for the two countries may differ and are shown separately in the charts and data tables. 
Data download
More than half (around 41,000) of the 76,000 excess deaths, from all causes, in England and Wales in 2020 occurred in private homes. A further 25,000 occurred in care homes. 
The contribution of COVID-19 to this increase in deaths in private homes is small, at just over 3,000. The increase of non-COVID-19 deaths in private homes is 30% above the five-year average. 
Care homes recorded a 21% rise in deaths from all causes, with nearly 25,000 more than expected — almost 19,000 of them due to COVID-19. Excluding the coronavirus, other care home deaths were 5% up on the five-year average. 
In hospitals, which were under significant pressure because of numbers of patients with the coronavirus, there were around 258,000 deaths from all causes, 10,000 (4%) more than the five-year average. 
Deaths in hospital from causes other than COVID-19 fell by more than 40,000 (16%). 
The new coronavirus (COVID-19) was the underlying cause of almost 74,000 deaths in 2020. Despite the first death only being registered in the week ending 13 March, it became the overall leading cause of death in England and Wales in 2020. 
The total number of deaths not due to COVID-19 in 2020 (534,000) was only slightly higher than the average for 2015 to 2019 (532,000) in England and Wales. Looking at Wales specifically, deaths not due to COVID-19 in 2020 (33,000) were slightly below the average (33,400). 
The next highest number of deaths registered in 2020 were ""dementia and Alzheimer’s disease"", ""ischaemic heart diseases"", ""cerebrovascular diseases"" (stroke) and certain types of cancer, which is similar to recent years. 
Deaths from different types of cancer (""malignant neoplasms"") are recorded separately. This is because cancer is a term that describes a collection of related diseases that vary widely in their behaviour and response to treatment. 
Data download
The most significant rise in deaths based on the previous five years was from ""chronic rheumatic heart diseases"", with just under 1,100 deaths registered in 2020, 36% higher when compared with 789 a year on average between 2015 and 2019. 
""Cirrhosis and other diseases of the liver"" caused almost 9,700 deaths, compared with an average of 8,300 between 2015 and 2019. Though deaths from this cause had generally been increasing over time prior to the pandemic, the rise between 2019 and 2020 was larger than seen in recent years. Proportionally, the biggest shift in deaths by this cause was in deaths in private homes, with nearly 2,400 in 2020 compared with an expected 1,800 (a rise of 31%). Analysis from Public Health England and academic studies has suggested that alcohol consumption in higher-risk drinkers increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact on mortality. 
Increases in deaths from these causes were the highest above the expected range, using z-scores. 
The z-scores are a more meaningful measure than percentage changes, which can be skewed by small numbers. 
There were 8,000 fewer deaths in England and Wales than expected from ""influenza and pneumonia"", likely due in part to social distancing reducing the spread. 
""Bronchitis, emphysema and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"" and ""renal failure"" were the underlying causes of death that fell the farthest below what was expected based on their five-year averages. 
Data download
Breast cancer deaths (""malignant neoplasms of breast"") were broadly in line with the 2015 to 2019 average. There were 10,385 deaths compared with an average of just over 10,200. 
However, more breast cancer deaths were registered in private homes than in hospitals, compared with the five-year average. 
There were just over 3,900 breast cancer deaths in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with just over 2,800 in hospitals. This compares with an average of just under 2,900 deaths at home and 3,400 deaths in hospital per year between 2015 and 2019. 
For prostate cancer (""malignant neoplasm of prostate""), 4,700 deaths out of a total of nearly 11,000 were in private homes in 2020 and just under 2,900 were in hospitals, compared with 3,300 in private homes and 3,600 in hospitals on average between 2015 and 2019. 
""Parkinson’s disease"" and ""diabetes"" deaths in private homes were up, by 66% for ""Parkinson’s disease"" (616 excess deaths) and by 60% for ""diabetes"" (894 excess deaths). 
Deaths due to ""influenza and pneumonia"" in private homes were 8% below the five-year average. 
Data download
There were more deaths (from all causes) in private homes in each month of 2020 than in a normal year, after the coronavirus pandemic struck in March. 
While the peak in excess deaths in care homes during April 2020 was much higher than in private homes, deaths remained above average in private homes for the rest of the year. Deaths other than in private homes in England fell below the five-year average during July and August 2020 while in Wales this happened in August and September 2020. 
Data download
In 2020, 89,000 people aged 85 years and over died in hospitals in England and Wales while 94,000 died in care homes and 50,000 in private homes. 
The number of people aged 85 years and over dying in hospital was slightly below the five-year average during 2020. However, among this age group, almost 31,000 more people than expected died in private homes and care homes. 
Deaths, from all causes, recorded in private homes among people aged 85 years and over were 43% above the five-year average in England and 38% above average in Wales during 2020. In care homes, the number of excess deaths came to 20% in England and 22% in Wales. 
At the same time, deaths in hospital from all causes among those aged 85 years and over fell slightly, while deaths in age groups 45 to 64 years and 75 to 84 years increased in both England and Wales. Hospital deaths among the age group 65 to 74 years increased in England but not in Wales.

There were 258,000 deaths from all causes in hospitals in England and Wales in 2020, 10,000 (4%) up on the five-year average. Deaths due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) accounted for 1 in 5 of these. 
While there were almost 33,000 deaths due to COVID-19 of females in England and Wales in 2020, fewer females died (of any cause) in hospital than the five-year average. 
There were 118,000 female deaths in hospital from any cause in England and Wales, compared with almost 121,000 a year on average between 2015 and 2019, a fall of 2%. There were nearly 140,000 male deaths in hospital in 2020, 10% above the five-year average of 127,000, reflecting the higher number of male deaths due to COVID-19. 
Males accounted for the largest share of excess deaths from any cause in England, at 18% above the five-year average compared with 11% for females. In Wales, male deaths were 14% above the average and female deaths were 10% above the average.

Deaths due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) were highest among the oldest age groups. 
Overall excess deaths, the percentage above the average for the previous five years, followed a similar pattern. There was also a higher percentage of excess deaths among males than females from the ages of 45 to 49 years onwards in England. 
However, the percentage of excess deaths in both England and Wales among those aged 65 to 69 years was the lowest of any age group above 40 to 44 years. 
Excess deaths in England among those aged 65 to 69 years were 7% above the average for males and 2% above the average for females, compared with 1% above average for males and 2% below average for females in Wales. 
Among the next age group down, 60 to 64 years, excess deaths were 18% above average for males and 14% above average for females in England while among the group aged 70 to 74 years they were 21% above average for males and 17% above average for females. 
In Wales, deaths among males aged 60 to 64 years were 10% above average and for females 14% above average in 2020 while for those aged 70 to 74 years deaths were 15% above average for males and 18% above average for females. 
Also in Wales, deaths of females aged 35 to 39 years were 47% higher than expected, with 105 registered in 2020 compared with a five-year average of around 71. Four deaths registered in 2020 in this age group, among males and females, were due to COVID-19.

More detailed information on excess deaths can be found in our accompanying dataset. In addition, more detailed analyses of excess deaths in England and Wales are produced by Public Health England and Public Health Wales. 
In this article, “excess” deaths are defined as the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the 2015 to 2019 average. The average provides a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a usual year. A five-year period was used because there has been relatively little year-on-year population change over the last five years (less than 1% increase each year). 
Z-scores demonstrate how mortality in 2020 differed from the five-year average. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations the observed number of deaths (registered in 2020) is from the average (2015 to 2019). Z-scores can be used to determine statistical significance. In this analysis, a Z-score of 0 means the number of deaths in 2020 was the same as the five-year average. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines coronaviruses as ""a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)"". Between 2001 and 2018, there were 12 deaths in England and Wales due to a coronavirus infection. COVID-19 refers to the ""coronavirus disease 2019"" and is a disease caused by a specific type of coronavirus. 
Deaths ""due to COVID-19"" are deaths registered in England and Wales where COVID-19 was the underlying (main) cause on the death certificate. A doctor can certify the involvement of COVID-19 based on symptoms and clinical findings – a positive test result is not required. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD-10) codes U.071, U.072, and U10.9 are included in our ""due to COVID-19"" definition. This article uses finalised mortality data for 2020, so numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 differ from figures in other publications based on provisional data, such as weekly deaths. 
The ONS has a short list for cause of death, developed in consultation with the Department of Health and Social Care, and based on one developed by the WHO. This list uses more specific groupings than the broad group level, splitting causes such as cancer and circulatory diseases into different subtypes, to provide policymakers with enough detail to generate appropriate health policies. In this article, short list cause groups with under 1,000 deaths in 2020 were merged with other groups to reduce problems associated with small counts. For more information on the groupings used see the Definitions tab of the accompanying dataset. 
This analysis focuses on the underlying cause of death only. Multiple health conditions that contributed to a death can be mentioned on the death certificate, and from these a single underlying (main) cause of death is derived using a set of rules. Information on pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19 is available based on provisional data. 
This analysis focuses on deaths registered in 2020; there is a delay between a death happening and it being registered, so some of the 2020 death registrations will have occurred in previous years. Deaths from external causes, such as accidents, violence and suicides can only be registered after investigation by a coroner. This process has been impacted by the pandemic, affecting the number of death registrations in 2020 from these causes. 
More quality and methodology information is available in the Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI and the User Guide to Mortality Statistics.

314,"Seated dining levels continue to rise as UK restrictions ease
6 May 2021
Seated diner restaurant reservations on Saturday 1 May 2021 were at 71% of the level seen on the same Saturday in 2019, according to OpenTable.
The estimates for seated diner reservations on Saturday 1 May 2021 were 9 percentage points higher than the equivalent figure from the previous week. This follows the reopening of restaurants, cafes and bars in Scotland and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, on 26 April and 30 April, respectively. 
Estimates for seated diner reservations in Manchester and London on Saturday 1 May 2021 had increased by 7 and 2 percentage points from the previous week to 90% and 43% of the levels seen on the equivalent Saturday of 2019, respectively. These slight increases follow the notable rise in estimates seen for Manchester and London since outdoor dining reopened in England on 12 April.

More people leave home as lockdown eases
7 May 2021
Just over one in five (21%) adults reported staying home or only leaving for work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs as lockdown restrictions ease. This continues a falling trend since mid-January 2021, when 65% of people were staying home.
During the period 28 April to 3 May 2021, more people said they were using previously closed services. Among adults who left home, 17% visited a hair salon or barber, compared with less than 1% in the week ending 10 January 2021.
Over one in four (28%) shopped for things other than necessities (compared with 6% in January). 10% took children to and from activities (compared with 1% in January).
Fewer adults (82%) are avoiding physical contact when outside their home compared with over 9 in 10 (92%) between 10 to 14 March. However, compliance with most measures remains high, with 87% of adults reporting handwashing when returning home (same as last week) and 98% using a face covering (97% last week).

Question: ""In the past seven days, for what reasons have you left your home?"".
Base: all adults who reported having in the past seven days left their home for any reason.

Compliance with most measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) remained high, with 87% of adults reporting handwashing when returning home (same as last week) and 98% using a face covering (97% last week); however, the proportion of adults avoiding physical contact when outside their home has fallen to 82%, which is the lowest it has been since between 9 and 13 September 2020 (81%).
Just over 1 in 5 (21%) adults reported staying home or only left for work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs in the past seven days as restrictions ease; a continued fall since January 2021 (65% between 13 and 17 January).
More people were leaving home in the last seven days to use services that were previously closed during lockdown; for example, among adults who left home, 17% visited a hair salon or barber (compared with less than 1% in the week ending 10 January 2021 when businesses began to close); 28% shopped for things other than basic necessities (compared with 6% in January) and 10% took children to and from activities (compared with 1% in January).
Over half (56%) of adults met up with someone outdoors not in their household, childcare or support bubble in the last seven days; similar to last week (57%) and a notable increase from the 19% reported between 10 and 14 March 2021, while adults meeting up indoors has remained relatively stable over time (10% this week and 13% between 10 and 14 March).
6 in 10 (60%) adults reported leaving home for work in the past seven days; a continued increase from last week (58%) and since mid-February 2021 (44% in the period 10 to 14 February) and returning to similar proportions as October 2020 (60% between 14 and 18 October).
Personal well-being levels are generally yet to recover to pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels and were relatively stable this week; happiness fell slightly (7.0 this week, 7.1 last week and 7.2 in February), anxiety increased slightly (3.9 this week, 3.8 last week and 3.5 in February), life satisfaction remained the same (7.0 this week and last week, 7.3 in February) and feelings that the things done in life are worthwhile improved slightly (7.4 this week, 7.3 last week and 7.6 in February).
Positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccine remained high; 93% of adults reported they had now either received a vaccine or would be likely to have a vaccine if offered; a similar proportion to last week (94%).
Over 6 in 10 (65%) adults reported to have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, which includes nearly 3 in 10 (28%) adults reporting to have received their second dose.

316,"Safety concerns raised by those refusing vaccine
7 May 2021
Between February and March 2021, 50 participants who were uncertain, unable, or unwilling to receive COVID-19 vaccines took part in interviews exploring their attitudes. Participants were not hesitant about vaccines in general, and many stressed that they did not belong to an “anti-vax” movement.
The most common concern was that participants did not trust that COVID-19 vaccines were safe. The speed of vaccine development and uncertainty about long-term side effects were frequently mentioned.


I feel like it’s too early. I don’t feel enough time or research has passed. I don’t know what the effects from the vaccine will be after five, 10 or 15 years from now.

Male, age 35 to 39 years, England

Some did not feel the COVID-19 vaccines were necessary because they were younger and thought they were unlikely to develop severe symptoms. Some thought they were already taking adequate steps to avoid catching the coronavirus (COVID-19).


I feel like I'm young enough and healthy enough so I would probably fight it off myself.

Female, age 35 to 39 years, England

Some participants had heard that COVID-19 vaccines contained ingredients that raised religious or ethical concerns.


Are there animal remnants in it? Halal and haram are a big issue [in my religion, Islam].

Analysis
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/covid19vaccinerefusaluk/februarytomarch2021,"Many participants who were unwilling or uncertain about receiving a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine expressed concerns about their safety; these included concerns about immediate side effects and longer-term impacts that participants felt could not yet be known.
Fears about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines were often linked with how quickly they had been developed; participants perceived this as a sign that the COVID-19 vaccines could not be as safe as other vaccines that had been developed and used over several years.
Some participants did not perceive catching COVID-19 as a significant risk; typically, this was because they were younger and felt they were unlikely to either catch or develop serious symptoms from catching COVID-19, or because they felt they were already taking adequate steps to avoid catching COVID-19.
Those who were unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccine cited barriers including: not being able to find childcare to attend the vaccination appointment; not being able to travel to the vaccination centre; or having existing physical or mental health conditions that prevented them from receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
There was an appetite for more information about COVID-19 vaccines, particularly: side effects; contents; how they had been developed; and differences between, and safety of, the various COVID-19 vaccines.
Some participants accessed information about COVID-19 vaccines from social media or unverified sources as well as, or instead of, mainstream media; this gave them cause for concern, for example, about the contents or side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.

317,"Vaccination rates in England are lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population
6 May 2021
Among adults aged 50 years and over in England, those identifying as Black Caribbean and Black African were the least likely to have received the first dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine by 12 April 2021 (66.8% and 71.2% respectively), followed by those from a Pakistani background (78.4%). This compares with 93.7% of the White British population. 
The differences between ethnic groups remain even after accounting for variations in where people lived, underlying health conditions, and measures of socio inequality. 
Separate data for Great Britain show that 30% of Black or Black British adults were hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccines in the period 31 March to 25 April 2021. This had improved since the start of the year but remained the highest among all ethnic groups. Vaccine hesitancy refers to those who have either declined a COVID-19 vaccine offer, report being unlikely to accept a vaccine or report being undecided.
Vaccination rates also differed by religious affiliation, with the lowest rate being among those who identified as Muslims (78.8%), followed by Buddhists (83.3%). The highest rate was seen among Christians (93.2%).
There was a relationship between proficiency in English language (as recorded in 2011 Census) and vaccination rates. The lowest rates were observed for those who did not speak English at all (75.3%) and those who did not speak English well (75.9%), compared with 92.7% for those whose main language was English. 
Meanwhile, people living in more deprived areas, those who have never worked or were long-term unemployed, those with no qualifications and those who did not own their own home all had lower vaccination rates than their more advantaged counterparts.

Vaccination rates also differed by religious affiliation, with the lowest rates being among those who identified as Muslim (78.8%) and Buddhist (83.3%); after adjusting for geography, socio-demographic factors and underlying health conditions, those identifying as Sikh and Hindu had a higher probability of being vaccinated than those in the Christian group.

There were lower vaccination rates among those in less advantaged socio-economic groups; people living in more deprived areas, those who have never worked or are long-term unemployed, those with no qualifications and those who do not own their own home all had lower vaccination rates than their more advantaged socio-economic class counterparts.
Disabled people who reported being “limited a lot” in their day-to-day activities had lower rates of vaccination (89.3%) compared with those who were non-disabled (92.3%); this disparity between disabled and non-disabled groups was greater within those aged 50 to 69 years than those aged 70 years and over.
Statistical modelling shows that the lower rates of vaccination in ethnic minorities, certain religious groups, disabled people and less advantaged socio-economic groups are not fully explained by differences in other geographical and socio-demographic factors or underlying health conditions.

318,"Record number of alcohol-specific deaths in 2020
6 May 2021
There were 7,423 deaths from alcohol-specific causes registered in England and Wales in 2020, equivalent to 13.0 per 100,000 people. The provisional estimates for the number and rate of alcohol-specific deaths in 2020 were the highest since records began in 2001. 
The number of alcohol-specific deaths in 2020 was 19.6% higher than in 2019 (6,209 deaths; 11.0 per 100,000 people). This year-on-year increase was also a record – between 2001 and 2019, the number of alcohol-specific deaths increased by an average of 2.1% each year. 
When comparing the same quarter across the years, the rate of alcohol-specific deaths in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020 was statistically similar to rates in previous years. However, rates in Quarter 2 (Apr to June), Quarter 3 (July to Sept) and Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 – after the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic – were all statistically significantly higher than in any other year back to 2001. 
The difference between 2019 and 2020 widened in each successive quarter; the age-standardised rate in 2020 was 8.5% higher in Quarter 1, 17.4% higher in Quarter 2, 21.9% higher in Quarter 3 and 28.3% higher in Quarter 4, than in the equivalent quarter of 2019. 
Data from Public Health England show that a rise in consumption in older age groups is likely to have driven the rise in alcohol-specific deaths. 
Alcohol consumption in younger age groups has decreased significantly during the pandemic period, but this is not reflected in the death rate because of the relatively low chance of young people dying from alcohol-specific causes. 
Consistent with previous years, the alcohol-specific death rate for males in 2020 (17.6 deaths per 100,000 males; 4,891 deaths) was around twice the rate for females (8.7 deaths per 100,000 females; 2,532 deaths).

There were 1,963 alcohol-specific deaths registered in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) of 2020, and with an age-standardised rate of 13.6 deaths per 100,000 people, this was the highest rate for any quarter in almost two decades.

Provisional analysis for England shows that the male alcohol-specific death rate in 2020 was 4.2 times higher in the most deprived local areas than the least deprived local areas (34.1 compared with 8.1 deaths per 100,000, respectively); in 2019 the same rate was 3.8 higher in the most deprived local areas than the least deprived local areas (29.1 compared with 7.6 deaths per 100,000, respectively).

The economy grew by 0.4% in February 2021
13 April 2021
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by 0.4% in February 2021 following a revised fall of 2.2% in January 2021. 
Restrictions were in place to varying degrees across all four nations of the UK throughout January and February. Restriction announcements for each nation are available: 
 - England
 - Scotland 
 - Wales 
 - Northern Ireland 
The output approach to GDP shows that February’s level is 7.8% below levels before the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were seen (February 2020), and 3.1% below the initial recovery peak (October 2020). Overall, all main sectors of GDP remain below their pre-pandemic levels, but only services remains notably lower than the initial recovery peak in October 2020. 
Output growth in the services sector was broadly flat in February 2021 (grew by just 0.2%) as coronavirus restrictions remained largely unchanged; this follows negative 2.5% growth in January 2021. 
Overall, in February 2021, consumer-facing services were 18.6% below pre-pandemic levels (February 2020), while all other services were 7% below pre-pandemic levels. 
The production sector grew in February 2021, by 1.0%. This was mainly because of manufacturing output picking up for the first time since November 2020, as the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers grew following contraction in the previous two months. 
The construction sector saw growth of 1.6% in February 2021, driven by both new work and repair and maintenance.

4 May 2021
Those aged 50 years and over had the highest redundancy rate across all age groups in the latest quarter (December 2020 to February 2021), with 9.7 per thousand within this age group being affected. This figure is up from 4.3 per thousand last year.
Over a quarter of redundancies for older male workers over the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were in manufacturing, while construction (the second most common industry for older men) had fewer redundancies at 8%. Around one-third of all redundancies for older female workers were in distribution, hotels and restaurants.

322,"Industries related to pharmaceuticals were among those that have performed best throughout the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
26 April 2021
Around 1 in 5 industries included in the Monthly Business Survey (MBS) were “resilient” during the pandemic in 2020. This is defined as industries that had a growth rate of at least -2% in total turnover between March to December 2020 and the same period in 2019. 
The chart below shows how these industries broadly behaved similarly to other industries throughout most of 2019. The two groups classified as resilient saw a large increase in turnover in March 2020 coinciding with the beginning of the pandemic, and subsequently a much smaller fall in April 2020 when compared with the other industries. 
Industries associated with pharmaceuticals performed particularly well. Turnover in the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations and wholesale of pharmaceutical goods increased by 19.4% and 13.5% in March to December 2020, compared with the same period of 2019. 
Half of the industries analysed in the education sector were resilient, whereas none were resilient in the accommodation and food and arts, entertainment and recreation sectors. While industries which could be linked to home and garden improvements performed the best, industries such as travel agents, tour operators and cinemas, performed the least well.

More people are meeting outdoors with other households
30 April 2021
This week, 57% of adults reported meeting up outdoors with someone not in their household, childcare or support bubble; a notable increase from the 19% reported between 10 and 14 March 2021. 
In the period 21 to 25 April 2021, 60% of adults reported meeting up (either indoors or outdoors) with someone outside their household in the last seven days (up from 54% last week). Since early March, this figure has followed a steady upward trend, with the only decrease coming in the previous week covering the period when many schools returned from the Easter break.
The increase in people meeting with other households has been driven by those meeting outdoors. The number of people meeting up indoors (either exclusively or in combination with meeting up outdoors) is currently at 10% and has remained relatively stable since January.

Question: ""Excluding work or education, in the past seven days, have you met up or socialised with anyone from outside your household, support, or childcare bubble?
Base: all adults.
Questions asked about meeting indoors and outdoors changed in March so interpretation of this time series should be made with caution.

324,"Regional differences in the proportion of adults working from home during the coronavirus lockdown
27 April 2021
The biggest increases in the number of adults who were working from home during the coronavirus pandemic were seen in particular household types in Scotland and the West Midlands.
Working from home was one of many ways in which people’s lives were affected in the regions and countries of Great Britain. Our analysis looks at the impact on households across significant points in the last year.
Workers living in one or two person households aged 16 to 64 years in London (70%) were most likely to report working from home in early 2021, whereas it was the North East where workers in similar households were least likely to report working from home (36%). 
The proportion of workers who reported they were able to work from home was similar in both the early 2021 lockdown (7 January to 28 March 2021) and spring 2020 (20 March to 31 May 2020). However, in regions across Great Britain, there were differences between the periods, particularly adults with children in Scotland where there was a 15 percentage point increase, and adults with children in the North East a 11 percentage point increase. For one or two person households aged 16 to 64 years, the biggest increase was by 10 percentage points, in the West Midlands.

Estimates for adults under 65 years combine responses from single adult and two person households where people are aged under 65 years.
Question asked: ""In the past seven days, have you worked from home because of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic?"". Base population: those who said they were working.
For this survey, a person is said to be working if last week: they had a paid job, either as an employee or self-employed; or they did any casual work for payment; or they did any unpaid or voluntary work.
Confidence intervals are provided in the datasets associated with this bulletin. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one estimate overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two estimates.

Working from home became a reality for working age adults throughout the pandemic, especially in London; the biggest increase in adults who reported working from home was seen in Scotland and the West Midlands. 
Households with children most frequently reported they were worried or very worried about the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on their lives, especially in London during spring 2020, where 84% of adults in these households reported this.
Positive sentiments on when life would return to normal were highest during spring 2020, especially among adults in households with children in the North West where 71% thought life would return to normal in less than a year, compared with the national average of 62%. 
The group that experienced that biggest change in perception were single adults under 65 years; 61% reported life would be back to normal in less than a year during the spring 2020 lockdown compared with 51% during the early 2021 lockdown; adults in Yorkshire and The Humber experienced the biggest change, a 27 percentage point decrease.

325,"People spent more time doing outdoor activities during lockdowns
26 April 2021
The proportion of people leaving home for exercise increased during lockdown periods, as restrictions limited other leisure activities. 
New analysis of data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) suggests that the rise in exercise was at least partly driven by people working from home, who have been more likely to leave the house for exercise than those who travel to work each day. 
Download the data
In July 2020, 46% of people surveyed by Natural England said they spent more time outside than usual during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Data from Natural England indicate that some people turned to nature to cope with feelings such as increased anxiety, with 41% of people saying that visits to natural spaces were more important to their wellbeing in May 2020 compared with before the pandemic. 
Decisions to make homeworking permanent by some businesses have allowed many people to think about moving closer to higher quality green space. Around 3 in 10 working adults (29%) responding to OPN in September 2020 said they intend to continue working from home after the pandemic. Of these, 12% said they had considered relocating, mostly to rural or coastal areas. 
Analysis 
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/howhaslockdownchangedourrelationshipwithnature/2021-04-26,"More than a year on from the first national lockdown in spring 2020, we look at how people's perception of nature changed during the pandemic and whether this is likely to continue as restrictions ease. 
26 April 2021
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced people to interact with familiar surroundings in new ways. While bedrooms have become offices, gardens – and the areas within walking distance of home – have become wildlife-watching spots and gyms. Nature has been a source of solace for many, as lockdown rules have heightened our appreciation for local parks and green spaces. 
Drawing on several sources, we look at the impact of lockdown on exercise levels, usage of public green spaces and the link between nature and wellbeing. 
Has the pandemic changed our relationship with the outdoors forever? 
During the first coronavirus lockdown, many people filled their free time with exercise. As restrictions limited other leisure activities, exercise levels increased. 
This could partly be down to higher levels of homeworking. New analysis shows that homeworkers have been more likely to leave the house for exercise during the pandemic than people with a daily commute. 
Around one in three workers (33%) were based exclusively at home in the spring 2020 lockdown (Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) survey, 14 to 17 May 2020); this had dropped to around one in five (20%) by late summer (26 to 30 August 2020), when restrictions had been eased. 
Between 7 and 11 April 2021, 28% of working adults worked exclusively from home. More than three-quarters (76%) of people who only worked from home in this period had left home for exercise in the previous seven days, compared with 52% of people who only travelled to work. Those working from home were also more likely to visit a park or local green space than those who travelled to work (45% compared with 30%). 
Data download
Along with the rise in outdoor exercise, people’s interest in nature surged. In May 2020, 36% of people responding to the People and Nature Survey by Natural England said they were spending more time outside during the pandemic than before. This rose to 46% in July 2020. 
Charities such as the RSPB and the Wildlife Trust saw spikes in web traffic in the first national lockdown. Visits to the RSPB website increased by 69% year-on-year in March to May 2020 with 79% of those users being new to the website. In the same period, the RSPB recorded a tenfold increase in views of its Build a bird box web page. 
When lockdown restrictions lifted in summer 2020, people relied on the outdoors for leisure time and their holidays. 
With children’s playgrounds and similar places closed during lockdown, visits to parks, and time spent in them, fell in the spring, but the subsequent increase during the summer was greater in 2020 than in previous years, according to Google mobility data for the UK. 
Data download
Similarly, while the British tourism sector struggled during summer 2020 because of limits on social contact, camping holiday sales surged year-on-year in July and August along with reports of higher sales of outdoor products such as bicycles, leisure equipment and campervans. 
While use of parks fell in rural and coastal areas during lockdown compared with pre-pandemic, there was a substantial rise in the summer, at least partly driven by domestic tourism. 
For example, visits to and time spent in parks in Cornwall increased by 4% between the start of the year and lockdown, but then went on to rise by 280% between the start of the year and September, with similar patterns in Devon, Norfolk and East Yorkshire. High Peak and Ribble Valley are notable as two rural areas that saw high mobility both during lockdown and in September. 
Data download
Isolation, along with other factors, contributed to a decline in mental health over the last year. 
This is reflected by lower personal well-being scores during lockdown periods – and throughout the pandemic – compared with before. However, there is evidence that the natural environment has helped some people to cope with negative feelings such as increased anxiety. 
Around 9 in 10 people surveyed by Natural England in May 2020 agreed that natural spaces are good for mental health and wellbeing. More than 40% noticed that nature, wildlife, and visiting local green and natural spaces have been even more important to their wellbeing since the coronavirus restrictions began. These percentages have remained stable throughout the pandemic. 
Local green and natural spaces have been important for well-being during the pandemicProportion of adults that have noticed or done the following since coronavirus restrictions were introduced, England, February 2021Source: Natural England – People and Nature SurveyNotes:Question: “Thinking about life since the coronavirus restrictions began, have you noticed or done any of the following?”Respondents can select multiple options so percentages will not sum to 100%.Download this chart Local green and natural spaces have been important for well-being during the pandemicImage.csv.xls
Green and outdoor spaces also appear to have played an important role in allowing people to see their loved ones during periods of isolation. 
The percentage of people increasing their time spent connecting with family and friends outdoors grew over lockdown, from 11% in May to 22% in July. This increase in summer persisted until January when it dropped to 19%. 
However, not everyone has equal access to the green space they need to improve their personal wellbeing. 
There is a clear connection between how people have been using the outdoors under coronavirus restrictions and the distance between green spaces and their doorstep. 
We can use Google mobility data to compare visits and time spent in parks and other natural spaces across different communities, during and after the first national lockdown. 
In lockdown, those living closer to their nearest public green space were more likely to visit than those living further away. In the summer, after lockdown, the opposite was true, with people living further away from their nearest green space more likely to visit than those living closer. 
Data download
Data also indicate a trade-off between private and public green space. Households in areas of the country with least access to private gardens are generally more likely to live close to a public park. 
In London, one in five (21%) households has no access to a private or shared garden, compared with 12% of households across Great Britain. And for those in London that do have access to a private garden, their gardens are 26% smaller than the national average. 
However, 44% of London residents are within an estimated five-minute walk of a park (this rises to 58% if playing fields are included). Both are the highest of any region or country in Great Britain. 
During the first lockdown in April, use of public green space increased in London (compared with a normal year), contrasting with falls elsewhere. The largest declines were seen in Wales and Scotland. This may be due to different restrictions in the respective countries – in normal times people in Wales are most likely to spend time outdoors. 
Use of parks was lower than normal in Wales and Scotland during the spring 2020 lockdownDifference between percent change in mobility to parks and public green spaces compared with a baseline period in 2020 and a normal year (0 represents use of parks in a normal year), 23 March to 4 July 2020 Source: Google – COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, Natural England – Monitor of Engagement with the Natural EnvironmentNotes:The chart compares data from Google (2020) with Natural England (2009 to 2018).

Of course, access to nearby green space does not guarantee that it is of sufficient quality (to want to spend time in) and size (to be able to maintain social distance). 
A significant percentage (around 40%) of the population were concerned about overcrowding and not being able to keep their distance from others when visiting their local green and natural spaces, according to analysis of Natural England’s People and Nature Survey by the New Economics Foundation (NEF). 
The average park in Great Britain serves just under 2,000 people, although some parks in densely populated areas such as London cater for many more people. Around 46,000 people in London have Clapham Common as their nearest park, more than 20 times the average. 
The NEF analysis that highlighted concerns about overcrowding found that around one in eight people (12.5%) don’t believe that their local green space is of a high enough standard to want to spend time in. People on lower incomes report greater dissatisfaction with the quality of their green space than those on higher incomes. 
The quality of nearby green space may have affected the way people spent their time during lockdown. According to our Time Use Survey, people in high-income households were spending twice as long keeping fit in April 2020 – through exercise classes and gym, running and jogging, team sports, and other sport – as those in low-income households (32 minutes per day compared with 16 minutes). 
Those from high-income households increased their time spent keeping fit by 36% during lockdown compared with 2015 (the most recent pre-pandemic data). In contrast, people from low-income households spent the same amount of time on fitness as before. 
Data download
The pandemic has underlined the importance of outdoor space, for people and policymakers. 
In October 2020, the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) asked companies about homeworking as a future business model. Around 1 in 6 (17%) businesses intended to move to homeworking permanently, with 61% of these pointing to improved staff wellbeing as a reason for the change. 
This could explain why our housing preferences are changing. Growth in sales of detached houses is outstripping that of flats. Meanwhile, Cornwall has overtaken London as the most searched-for location on Rightmove this year, with Devon and Dorset also in the top 10. 
However, the interest in nature that we saw in spring and summer 2020 has not necessarily carried through to winter 2020 and early 2021. A University College London (UCL) survey suggests that many of the lifestyle changes adopted during the first national lockdown had slipped, with people instead spending more time watching television, which may be unsurprising because of the colder and darker weather. 
It could be that the people most likely to maintain lockdown lifestyle changes, such as increased exercise and visits to green spaces, are those whose circumstances most allow them to, such as those whose workplaces decide to offer homeworking permanently. 
If businesses were to carry out their plans to continue offering homeworking following the pandemic, it could lead to an influx of wealthier people of working age (the demographic who are more likely to spend time in nature recreationally) moving to rural and coastal areas. 
Midway through September 2020, around 3 in 10 (29%) working adults said that they intend to continue working from home after the pandemic all or most of the time. Among those people, 12% said they had considered relocating, mostly to rural or coastal areas, places that typically have a high percentage of retired people. 
At the time of the 2011 census, the distribution of homeworkers was most concentrated in small coastal communities such as Tintagel, Porlock and Lynton in the South West (30 to 35%) and certain rural areas such as West Somerset, Ceredigion and Powys (22 to 26%). The 2021 Census, carried out last month, will provide data on how this has changed. 
Lockdown has disrupted our relationship with nature, from propelling us to find new appreciation for our natural surroundings to highlighting societal inequalities that exist in access to green space. 
Shifts in personal behaviour and corporate attitudes could mean that the UK, post-lockdown, will value and interact with nature on a much greater scale than before the pandemic. 
What we do not yet know is whether the changes brought on by lockdown will be a temporary trend, or a new way of life. 
Google defines “mobility” as visits to and time spent at a categorised area. The category of parks includes public gardens, national forests, campgrounds, and other outdoor spaces. This does not refer to the general outdoors found in rural areas. To understand mobility trends during the coronavirus pandemic, Google compares mobility on a given weekday to the median mobility on that weekday in a five-week period before the pandemic (the baseline). This baseline period is from 3 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. The mobility figure for a given day is the percentage change in mobility compared with the corresponding median for that day in the baseline period. 
The baseline period occurs in winter, when there are fewer visits to parks. Without coronavirus restrictions, we would expect visits to parks to increase in the spring and summer. 
Using historical data from the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey we attempt to normalise for seasonal changes in mobility to parks. MENE data cover England only and counts the number of short visits made by residents of a region. Estimates for Scotland and Wales are based on visit data for the whole of England. Google mobility data includes overnight tourism, so for the post-lockdown period where restrictions on overnight stays had been lifted, normalisation is less effective. 
The lockdown period referred to in this article is from 23 March 2020 to 4 July 2020. For each geography, an average percent change in mobility from the baseline is taken across all dates for which data are available. The number of dates from which an average is taken varies by geography. This is repeated for a post-lockdown period, which is from 5 July 2020 to 4 September 2020. Mobility data are available for all Google geographies in the lockdown period (350 Local Authority Districts and two Counties), but there are 13 geographies for which post-lockdown mobility data are unavailable. 
We use Ordnance Survey data to estimate access to local greenspaces across Great Britain. This is done at postcode level, with business and rural postcodes removed to show data for residential urban areas only. Urban postcodes are most appropriate for estimates of proximity to greenspace and linking with the google mobility data. We also provide data tables for all residential postcodes (including rural). This postcode level data are aggregated to larger geographies and weighted on LSOA level population data from the 2011 Census. Two datasets are used to measure the minimum and maximum level of public access to greenspace. One contains “parks” and “public gardens”; the other also contains “playing fields” which may be private. 
Access to private gardens data are matched to access to greenspace data on postcode. The average garden size for flats at postcode level are estimated from MSOA level aggregates. The average garden size for flats and houses at larger geographies are aggregated from postcode level and weighted on both LSOA level population data and the number of flats or houses in that geography.

326,"Inquest delays led to fewer suicide registrations in 2020
26 April 2021
Fewer suicides were registered in 2020 compared to 2019, but this is likely because of due to inquests being delayed during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
All suicides must be investigated by a coroner, who holds an inquest to formally establish what happened.
This means there is a delay of several months between someone dying and a death being registered as suicide.
Overall, there were 4,902 suicides registered in England in 2020, a provisional rate of 9.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 people.
Around half of those suicide registrations were from deaths in 2020 (2,512 deaths).
The 2020 suicide registration rate is significantly lower than the rate of 10.8 suicide deaths per 100,000 registered in 2019, but these figures are unlikely to be reflective of an actual reduction in suicide deaths.
Inquest delays particularly affected suicide registration in the second quarter of 2020 (April to June), which had the lowest recorded number of suicide deaths since 2001.
As inquests resumed, suicide registrations increased in the third and fourth quarters (July to September and October to December) to levels similar to previous years.
The total number of people who died by suicide in 2020 will not be known for some time.

In Quarter 4 2020 death registrations, there were 17.7 suicide deaths per 100,000 males (1,085 deaths registered) and 5.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 females (376 deaths registered); these rates are similar to rates observed in the same quarter in previous years.
Taken as a whole, 4,902 suicides were registered in England in 2020, equivalent to a provisional rate of 9.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 people; this represents a statistically significant reduction in the rate from 2019 when there were 10.8 suicide deaths per 100,000, but caution is required in the interpretation of this decrease.
The reduction in the number of suicides registered in 2020 from the previous year most likely reflects delays to coroner inquests, because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as opposed to a genuine decrease in suicide.

The proportion of UK businesses currently trading has increased to 87% in the second half of May 2021, the highest proportion since comparable estimates began in June 2020. A further 3% of businesses intend to restart trading in the next two weeks according to the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (Wave 31). 
In comparison, the proportion of businesses’ workforce on furlough leave has fallen to 8% in the first half of May 2021. This is comparable with the lowest recorded proportion in October 2020. 
Focusing on the accommodation and food service activities industry, one of the industries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic: 
 - the percentage of businesses currently trading has risen from 61% in the first half of May to 83% in the second half of May 2021
 - the proportions of businesses’ workforce on furlough leave has fallen from 31% in late April to early May to 21% in the first half of May 2021 
These changes are likely because of the further relaxation of coronavirus regulations on 17 May 2021 (24 May for Northern Ireland), allowing indoor dining.

The proportion of businesses' workforce on furlough leave has fallen to 8% in mid-May 2021, as a result of coronavirus restrictions continuing to be relaxed across the UK; this is comparable with the lowest recorded proportion in October 2020 since the furlough scheme began.
The proportion of businesses experiencing challenges in importing and exporting has remained broadly unchanged since the start of January 2021, following a rise after the end of the EU exit transition period in December 2020.
The main challenge reported by currently trading businesses involved in exporting was additional paperwork, and for those importing, it was change in transportation costs.

329,"There are fewer fully employed households than last year
There are 21 million households in the UK with at least one member aged between 16 and 64 years.
Of such households, about three in five (59%) had all members aged 16 years and over in employment during the period January to March 2021. This figure is down 1.4 percentage points compared with the same period in 2020.
Approximately 3 in 10 (27.6%) such households had a mix of at least one working and one workless adult, up 1.8 percentage points compared with the same period last year.

330,"No difference in self-isolation adherence between deprivation groups after a positive COVID-19 test
A majority of people required to self-isolate in England after a positive coronavirus (COVID-19) test report following the requirements fully, as new data show no difference in isolation rates according to deprivation.
Data collected between 10 and 15 May show 86% of those required to self-isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reported fully adhering to the requirements throughout their self-isolation period.
This is the first time adherence has been reported by Index of Multiple Deprivation groups - a measure of relative deprivation across England. The data show no statistically significant difference in the proportion of people who report full adherence to self-isolation between deprivation levels.
Over the same period, over a third of those who tested positive (37%) reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their mental health and well-being.
Around one in four people (27%) reported having lost income because of self-isolation.
Adherence to self-isolation requirements was 98% in the first 24 hours after receiving a positive test result and 96% for the remainder of the isolation period. These are statistically significantly higher rates of adherence than those self-isolating between the onset of symptoms and a positive test result (84%).

331,"The economy grew by 2.1% in March 2021
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by 2.1% in March 2021, the fastest monthly growth since August 2020, as schools in some parts of the UK reopened throughout the month.
The output approach to GDP shows that March’s level is 5.9% below the levels seen in February 2020, and 1.1% below the initial recovery peak in October 2020.
Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 1.5% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020, following 1.3% growth in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020. 
The service sector grew by 1.9% in March 2021, with schools re-opening across England and Wales and retail trade sales continuing to show strength. However, despite this growth, education output in March 2021 remained 3.9% below its December 2020 level, when schools were last fully open before the latest coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were introduced across the UK.
Output in human health and social work activities grew 1.7% in March 2021, following revised growth of 0.7% in February and negative 0.7% in January. This gradual pick up in health in the first three months of 2021 is driven by the NHS Test and Trace service and COVID-19 vaccination across the UK.
Output in the production sector grew by 1.8% in March 2021, as manufacturing grew for a second consecutive month, at 2.1%.
The construction sector grew by 5.8% in March 2021, driven by growth in both new work and repair and maintenance. The growth in construction (and indeed manufacturing) reflects businesses continuing to adapt, including development of COVID-19 secure environments in which to operate.

332,"Borrowing in April 2021 fell compared with a year earlier, but was still the second-highest since records began
In April 2021, the UK public sector borrowed £31.7 billion. This is the second-highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, £15.6 billion less than in April 2020. 
Central government receipts were estimated to have increased by £3.8 billion in April 2021 compared with April 2020, reaching £58.0 billion, including £42.5 billion in tax receipts. 
Central government bodies are estimated to have spent £83.9 billion on day-to-day activities (referred to as current expenditure) in April 2021, £15.5 billion less than a year earlier. Of this, £5.5 billion reflects the cost of the coronavirus job support schemes (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and Self-employment Income Support Scheme), £4.5 billion less than a year earlier. 
In the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021, the UK public sector borrowed £300.3 billion, revised down by £2.8 billion from last month’s first provisional estimate. This remains the highest borrowing since records began in FYE March 1946. 
Expressed as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP), public sector net borrowing in FYE March 2021 was 14.3%, revised down by 0.2 percentage points from last month’s first provisional estimate. It remains the highest such ratio since the end of World War Two, when it was 15.2% in FYE March 1946. 
On a like-for-like basis, borrowing in the FYE March 2021 was £27.1 billion less than the official forecast made by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR expects that borrowing could reach £233.9 billion in the FYE March 2022. 
This substantial increase in borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt which currently stands at 98.5% of GDP, the highest ratio since the 99.5% that was recorded in March 1962.

333,"The reduction in the UK’s total trade in goods has been greater with EU countries than non-EU countries
UK total trade in goods (imports plus exports) with EU countries decreased by 23.1% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021 compared to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2018. This was because goods exports fell by 24.0% and imports by 22.5%. Total trade in goods with non-EU countries fell by a much smaller 0.8% in the same period. 
Total goods trade with EU countries reduced by 20.3% between Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 and Quarter 1 2021. Stockpiling both in the UK and in the EU prior to the end of the EU transition period on 1 January 2021 may have contributed to this. Total goods trade with non-EU countries reduced by a lesser 0.4%. 
Evidence from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) shows that, of currently trading businesses that have reported challenges at the end of February 2021, many businesses reported that the end of the EU transition period was a challenge in importing and/or exporting in this period, more so than the pandemic. 
Of the UK’s five largest import partners, only goods imports from China have increased between Quarter 1 2018 and Quarter 1 2021. The 59% growth in imports over this period is in part likely because of China’s exports not being as affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as other countries, and increased demand for electronics and textiles with the latter being caused by increased demand for personal protective equipment (PPE).

335,"Retail sales continue to rise above pre-pandemic levels
Both the quantity bought and the amount spent in retailers in Great Britain increased 9.2% in April 2021 compared with March.

Overall, sales volumes and values continued to rise above pre-pandemic levels (February 2020), although this recovery was not felt equally among sectors.

338,"People who live in London are more likely to report lower levels of happiness than those who live in the rest of the UK
Data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) suggests that average happiness in England and Wales was lower in all periods between March 2020 and March 2021 than in February 2020. 
Subnational analysis shows that adults in London reported lower levels of happiness than other areas of the country, whereas happiness in rural areas was higher on average across all periods compared with urban areas. 
Regression analysis suggests that out of the factors analysed, respondents feeling lonely at least some of the time had the greatest impact on feelings of happiness. Adults in rural areas experienced the greatest impact on their level of happiness as a result of loneliness, although a higher percentage of people in urban areas felt lonely. 
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has played a part in peoples’ levels of happiness. Respondents who felt uncomfortable leaving home reported lower levels of happiness than those who were comfortable leaving home. 
Furthermore, people who were unsure on how to best protect themselves against COVID-19 reported lower happiness levels, with the highest proportion of uninformed people being in London (4%).

Adults in urban areas (including London) who had worked from home over the last seven days were more likely to report lower levels of happiness than those who had not worked from home. 
When compared with the baseline of respondents aged 75 years or over, all younger adults across all areas had significantly lower levels of happiness; this indicates that people over the age of 75 years are most likely to report the highest level of happiness, especially compared with those aged 35 to 44 years.

339,"Majority of those in contact with a positive case of coronavirus (COVID-19) adhere to self-isolation rules
Of people required to self-isolate following contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), 93% reported full adherence to self-isolation requirements.
However, 7% reported at least one activity during self-isolation that was not in line with the guidance. Of those who were not adherent, 87% left their house at least once during the isolation period for a non-permitted reason. Of those who had contact with non-household members at least once during their isolation period, more than half (56%) met two to five non-household members at any one time.
Of all respondents, just over one in five (21%) developed coronavirus symptoms. Compliance with self-isolation guidance was significantly higher among those who developed symptoms of coronavirus (97%) compared with those who did not (92%).
Approximately one-third (34%) of respondents reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their mental well-being. One in four (25%) reported losing income because of self-isolation. Of those who were working prior to self-isolation, one-fifth (20%) reported not being paid during isolation.

340,"Student life satisfaction improves as socialising increases
Average life satisfaction scores for students in England continued to improve for students in May 2021, following rises in life satisfaction in April, as restrictions began to lift. However, the average life satisfaction scores for students (5.8 out of 10) are still statistically significantly lower than the rest of the adult population (7.0 out of 10). 
Between May 4 and 12 2021, the proportion of students reporting leaving home for recreational purposes or exercise, go to work and travel to different areas all increased compared with previous months. The proportion of students reporting limiting their social contact to household, support bubble or childcare bubble also declined. 
Almost half (47%) of students that left the house in the previous seven days reported they had met up with family or friends they don’t live with indoors; this was more than double who reported the same in March 2021 (21%). However, the proportion of students reporting having taken at least one COVID-19 test in the last seven days (whether or not they had symptoms) was also higher than in April 2021.

The majority of students (86%) said that they were living at the same address as they were at the start of the autumn term 2020; this has statistically significantly increased since March 2021 (76%).
Most students (71%) stayed in their current accommodation over the Easter break; however, around one in five (22%) students travelled to stay with family or friends over the Easter break, with the majority (84%) of those staying for more than two nights.

UK online job adverts for “catering and hospitality” roles were above pre-pandemic levels, at 103% of their February 2020 average on 7 May 2021.
According to Adzuna, the volume of online job adverts for catering and hospitality has increased by 46 percentage points since 9 April 2021, a strong upward trend coinciding with the recent easing of hospitality restrictions across the UK.

Further category breakdowns are included in the  Online job advert estimates dataset and more details on the methodology can be found in  Using Adzuna data to derive an indicator of weekly vacancies.

343,"Coronavirus lockdowns drove fall in recorded crime across England and Wales in 2020
Recorded crime in England and Wales fell by 8% in the 12 months to December 2020, driven by substantial reductions during coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown restrictions.
Approximately 5.6 million offences were recorded, with reductions in most crime types – including a 26% fall in theft offences.
Offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime) fell by 9%, largely because of a 29% decrease in knife-enabled robbery offences. Across London, knife-enabled crime fell by 21% compared with 2019.
However, the number of domestic abuse-related offences recorded by police rose by 7% compared with 2019. A 15% rise in drug offences reflected proactive police activity in crime hotspots during lockdown.

Recorded offences fluctuated alongside coronavirus restrictions. October to December 2020 saw a 7% decrease in recorded crime compared with the previous three months, as measures were tightened across England and Wales.
It follows a 15% fall in April to June 2020 as the first lockdown was imposed, and a 19% rise in July to September 2020, as restrictions were eased over the summer.

7 May 2021
Deaths in private homes, from all causes, were one-third higher in 2020 than in the previous five years. There were around 167,000 deaths from all causes in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with an average of 125,000 between 2015 and 2019. 
The majority of deaths due to COVID-19 (where the coronavirus was the main cause) occurred in hospitals and care homes, while many deaths from other causes, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, happened in private homes. Our analysis shows that many of these deaths at home were people who, in a non-pandemic year, may have typically died elsewhere such as in hospital. 
Deaths in hospital were 4% above the five-year average. However, if deaths due to COVID-19 are excluded, then deaths in hospitals would have been 16% lower than the average. 
Our first release of the finalised mortality data for 2020 shows that “excess deaths” from all causes were 14% above the five-year average in England and Wales, with the coronavirus (COVID-19) being the main reason for excess deaths. 
Excess deaths are the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Using the average gives us a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a ""usual"" year, before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
There were almost 76,000 more deaths from all causes and in all locations (hospitals, care homes, private homes and elsewhere) in England and Wales in 2020 than the five-year average. COVID-19 was responsible for 97% of the excess, having not previously existed. 
This analysis looks at England and Wales as a whole; trends for the two countries may differ and are shown separately in the charts and data tables. 
Data download
More than half (around 41,000) of the 76,000 excess deaths, from all causes, in England and Wales in 2020 occurred in private homes. A further 25,000 occurred in care homes. 
The contribution of COVID-19 to this increase in deaths in private homes is small, at just over 3,000. The increase of non-COVID-19 deaths in private homes is 30% above the five-year average. 
Care homes recorded a 21% rise in deaths from all causes, with nearly 25,000 more than expected — almost 19,000 of them due to COVID-19. Excluding the coronavirus, other care home deaths were 5% up on the five-year average. 
In hospitals, which were under significant pressure because of numbers of patients with the coronavirus, there were around 258,000 deaths from all causes, 10,000 (4%) more than the five-year average. 
Deaths in hospital from causes other than COVID-19 fell by more than 40,000 (16%). 
The new coronavirus (COVID-19) was the underlying cause of almost 74,000 deaths in 2020. Despite the first death only being registered in the week ending 13 March, it became the overall leading cause of death in England and Wales in 2020. 
The total number of deaths not due to COVID-19 in 2020 (534,000) was only slightly higher than the average for 2015 to 2019 (532,000) in England and Wales. Looking at Wales specifically, deaths not due to COVID-19 in 2020 (33,000) were slightly below the average (33,400). 
The next highest number of deaths registered in 2020 were ""dementia and Alzheimer’s disease"", ""ischaemic heart diseases"", ""cerebrovascular diseases"" (stroke) and certain types of cancer, which is similar to recent years. 
Deaths from different types of cancer (""malignant neoplasms"") are recorded separately. This is because cancer is a term that describes a collection of related diseases that vary widely in their behaviour and response to treatment. 
Data download
The most significant rise in deaths based on the previous five years was from ""chronic rheumatic heart diseases"", with just under 1,100 deaths registered in 2020, 36% higher when compared with 789 a year on average between 2015 and 2019. 
""Cirrhosis and other diseases of the liver"" caused almost 9,700 deaths, compared with an average of 8,300 between 2015 and 2019. Though deaths from this cause had generally been increasing over time prior to the pandemic, the rise between 2019 and 2020 was larger than seen in recent years. Proportionally, the biggest shift in deaths by this cause was in deaths in private homes, with nearly 2,400 in 2020 compared with an expected 1,800 (a rise of 31%). Analysis from Public Health England and academic studies has suggested that alcohol consumption in higher-risk drinkers increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact on mortality. 
Increases in deaths from these causes were the highest above the expected range, using z-scores. 
The z-scores are a more meaningful measure than percentage changes, which can be skewed by small numbers. 
There were 8,000 fewer deaths in England and Wales than expected from ""influenza and pneumonia"", likely due in part to social distancing reducing the spread. 
""Bronchitis, emphysema and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"" and ""renal failure"" were the underlying causes of death that fell the farthest below what was expected based on their five-year averages.

Breast cancer deaths (""malignant neoplasms of breast"") were broadly in line with the 2015 to 2019 average. There were 10,385 deaths compared with an average of just over 10,200. 
However, more breast cancer deaths were registered in private homes than in hospitals, compared with the five-year average. 
There were just over 3,900 breast cancer deaths in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with just over 2,800 in hospitals. This compares with an average of just under 2,900 deaths at home and 3,400 deaths in hospital per year between 2015 and 2019. 
For prostate cancer (""malignant neoplasm of prostate""), 4,700 deaths out of a total of nearly 11,000 were in private homes in 2020 and just under 2,900 were in hospitals, compared with 3,300 in private homes and 3,600 in hospitals on average between 2015 and 2019. 
""Parkinson’s disease"" and ""diabetes"" deaths in private homes were up, by 66% for ""Parkinson’s disease"" (616 excess deaths) and by 60% for ""diabetes"" (894 excess deaths). 
Deaths due to ""influenza and pneumonia"" in private homes were 8% below the five-year average.

There were more deaths (from all causes) in private homes in each month of 2020 than in a normal year, after the coronavirus pandemic struck in March. 
While the peak in excess deaths in care homes during April 2020 was much higher than in private homes, deaths remained above average in private homes for the rest of the year. Deaths other than in private homes in England fell below the five-year average during July and August 2020 while in Wales this happened in August and September 2020.

In 2020, 89,000 people aged 85 years and over died in hospitals in England and Wales while 94,000 died in care homes and 50,000 in private homes. 
The number of people aged 85 years and over dying in hospital was slightly below the five-year average during 2020. However, among this age group, almost 31,000 more people than expected died in private homes and care homes. 
Deaths, from all causes, recorded in private homes among people aged 85 years and over were 43% above the five-year average in England and 38% above average in Wales during 2020. In care homes, the number of excess deaths came to 20% in England and 22% in Wales. 
At the same time, deaths in hospital from all causes among those aged 85 years and over fell slightly, while deaths in age groups 45 to 64 years and 75 to 84 years increased in both England and Wales. Hospital deaths among the age group 65 to 74 years increased in England but not in Wales.

There were 258,000 deaths from all causes in hospitals in England and Wales in 2020, 10,000 (4%) up on the five-year average. Deaths due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) accounted for 1 in 5 of these. 
While there were almost 33,000 deaths due to COVID-19 of females in England and Wales in 2020, fewer females died (of any cause) in hospital than the five-year average. 
There were 118,000 female deaths in hospital from any cause in England and Wales, compared with almost 121,000 a year on average between 2015 and 2019, a fall of 2%. There were nearly 140,000 male deaths in hospital in 2020, 10% above the five-year average of 127,000, reflecting the higher number of male deaths due to COVID-19. 
Males accounted for the largest share of excess deaths from any cause in England, at 18% above the five-year average compared with 11% for females. In Wales, male deaths were 14% above the average and female deaths were 10% above the average.

Deaths due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) were highest among the oldest age groups. 
Overall excess deaths, the percentage above the average for the previous five years, followed a similar pattern. There was also a higher percentage of excess deaths among males than females from the ages of 45 to 49 years onwards in England. 
However, the percentage of excess deaths in both England and Wales among those aged 65 to 69 years was the lowest of any age group above 40 to 44 years. 
Excess deaths in England among those aged 65 to 69 years were 7% above the average for males and 2% above the average for females, compared with 1% above average for males and 2% below average for females in Wales. 
Among the next age group down, 60 to 64 years, excess deaths were 18% above average for males and 14% above average for females in England while among the group aged 70 to 74 years they were 21% above average for males and 17% above average for females. 
In Wales, deaths among males aged 60 to 64 years were 10% above average and for females 14% above average in 2020 while for those aged 70 to 74 years deaths were 15% above average for males and 18% above average for females. 
Also in Wales, deaths of females aged 35 to 39 years were 47% higher than expected, with 105 registered in 2020 compared with a five-year average of around 71. Four deaths registered in 2020 in this age group, among males and females, were due to COVID-19.

More detailed information on excess deaths can be found in our accompanying dataset. In addition, more detailed analyses of excess deaths in England and Wales are produced by Public Health England and Public Health Wales. 
In this article, “excess” deaths are defined as the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the 2015 to 2019 average. The average provides a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a usual year. A five-year period was used because there has been relatively little year-on-year population change over the last five years (less than 1% increase each year). 
Z-scores demonstrate how mortality in 2020 differed from the five-year average. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations the observed number of deaths (registered in 2020) is from the average (2015 to 2019). Z-scores can be used to determine statistical significance. In this analysis, a Z-score of 0 means the number of deaths in 2020 was the same as the five-year average. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines coronaviruses as ""a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)"". Between 2001 and 2018, there were 12 deaths in England and Wales due to a coronavirus infection. COVID-19 refers to the ""coronavirus disease 2019"" and is a disease caused by a specific type of coronavirus. 
Deaths ""due to COVID-19"" are deaths registered in England and Wales where COVID-19 was the underlying (main) cause on the death certificate. A doctor can certify the involvement of COVID-19 based on symptoms and clinical findings – a positive test result is not required. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD-10) codes U.071, U.072, and U10.9 are included in our ""due to COVID-19"" definition. This article uses finalised mortality data for 2020, so numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 differ from figures in other publications based on provisional data, such as weekly deaths. 
The ONS has a short list for cause of death, developed in consultation with the Department of Health and Social Care, and based on one developed by the WHO. This list uses more specific groupings than the broad group level, splitting causes such as cancer and circulatory diseases into different subtypes, to provide policymakers with enough detail to generate appropriate health policies. In this article, short list cause groups with under 1,000 deaths in 2020 were merged with other groups to reduce problems associated with small counts. For more information on the groupings used see the Definitions tab of the accompanying dataset. 
This analysis focuses on the underlying cause of death only. Multiple health conditions that contributed to a death can be mentioned on the death certificate, and from these a single underlying (main) cause of death is derived using a set of rules. Information on pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19 is available based on provisional data. 
This analysis focuses on deaths registered in 2020; there is a delay between a death happening and it being registered, so some of the 2020 death registrations will have occurred in previous years. Deaths from external causes, such as accidents, violence and suicides can only be registered after investigation by a coroner. This process has been impacted by the pandemic, affecting the number of death registrations in 2020 from these causes. 
More quality and methodology information is available in the Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI and the User Guide to Mortality Statistics.

345,"Seated dining levels continue to rise as UK restrictions ease
Seated diner restaurant reservations on Saturday 1 May 2021 were at 71% of the level seen on the same Saturday in 2019, according to OpenTable.
The estimates for seated diner reservations on Saturday 1 May 2021 were 9 percentage points higher than the equivalent figure from the previous week. This follows the reopening of restaurants, cafes and bars in Scotland and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, on 26 April and 30 April, respectively. 
Estimates for seated diner reservations in Manchester and London on Saturday 1 May 2021 had increased by 7 and 2 percentage points from the previous week to 90% and 43% of the levels seen on the equivalent Saturday of 2019, respectively. These slight increases follow the notable rise in estimates seen for Manchester and London since outdoor dining reopened in England on 12 April.

346,"More people leave home as lockdown eases
Just over one in five (21%) adults reported staying home or only leaving for work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs as lockdown restrictions ease. This continues a falling trend since mid-January 2021, when 65% of people were staying home.
During the period 28 April to 3 May 2021, more people said they were using previously closed services. Among adults who left home, 17% visited a hair salon or barber, compared with less than 1% in the week ending 10 January 2021.
Over one in four (28%) shopped for things other than necessities (compared with 6% in January). 10% took children to and from activities (compared with 1% in January).
Fewer adults (82%) are avoiding physical contact when outside their home compared with over 9 in 10 (92%) between 10 to 14 March. However, compliance with most measures remains high, with 87% of adults reporting handwashing when returning home (same as last week) and 98% using a face covering (97% last week).

Compliance with most measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) remained high, with 87% of adults reporting handwashing when returning home (same as last week) and 98% using a face covering (97% last week); however, the proportion of adults avoiding physical contact when outside their home has fallen to 82%, which is the lowest it has been since between 9 and 13 September 2020 (81%).
Just over 1 in 5 (21%) adults reported staying home or only left for work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs in the past seven days as restrictions ease; a continued fall since January 2021 (65% between 13 and 17 January).
More people were leaving home in the last seven days to use services that were previously closed during lockdown; for example, among adults who left home, 17% visited a hair salon or barber (compared with less than 1% in the week ending 10 January 2021 when businesses began to close); 28% shopped for things other than basic necessities (compared with 6% in January) and 10% took children to and from activities (compared with 1% in January).
Over half (56%) of adults met up with someone outdoors not in their household, childcare or support bubble in the last seven days; similar to last week (57%) and a notable increase from the 19% reported between 10 and 14 March 2021, while adults meeting up indoors has remained relatively stable over time (10% this week and 13% between 10 and 14 March).
6 in 10 (60%) adults reported leaving home for work in the past seven days; a continued increase from last week (58%) and since mid-February 2021 (44% in the period 10 to 14 February) and returning to similar proportions as October 2020 (60% between 14 and 18 October).
Personal well-being levels are generally yet to recover to pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels and were relatively stable this week; happiness fell slightly (7.0 this week, 7.1 last week and 7.2 in February), anxiety increased slightly (3.9 this week, 3.8 last week and 3.5 in February), life satisfaction remained the same (7.0 this week and last week, 7.3 in February) and feelings that the things done in life are worthwhile improved slightly (7.4 this week, 7.3 last week and 7.6 in February).
Positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccine remained high; 93% of adults reported they had now either received a vaccine or would be likely to have a vaccine if offered; a similar proportion to last week (94%).
Over 6 in 10 (65%) adults reported to have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, which includes nearly 3 in 10 (28%) adults reporting to have received their second dose.

347,"Safety concerns raised by those refusing vaccine
Between February and March 2021, 50 participants who were uncertain, unable, or unwilling to receive COVID-19 vaccines took part in interviews exploring their attitudes. Participants were not hesitant about vaccines in general, and many stressed that they did not belong to an “anti-vax” movement.
The most common concern was that participants did not trust that COVID-19 vaccines were safe. The speed of vaccine development and uncertainty about long-term side effects were frequently mentioned.


I feel like it’s too early. I don’t feel enough time or research has passed. I don’t know what the effects from the vaccine will be after five, 10 or 15 years from now.

Male, age 35 to 39 years, England

Some did not feel the COVID-19 vaccines were necessary because they were younger and thought they were unlikely to develop severe symptoms. Some thought they were already taking adequate steps to avoid catching the coronavirus (COVID-19).


I feel like I'm young enough and healthy enough so I would probably fight it off myself.

Female, age 35 to 39 years, England

Some participants had heard that COVID-19 vaccines contained ingredients that raised religious or ethical concerns.


Are there animal remnants in it? Halal and haram are a big issue [in my religion, Islam].

Analysis
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/covid19vaccinerefusaluk/februarytomarch2021,"Many participants who were unwilling or uncertain about receiving a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine expressed concerns about their safety; these included concerns about immediate side effects and longer-term impacts that participants felt could not yet be known.
Fears about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines were often linked with how quickly they had been developed; participants perceived this as a sign that the COVID-19 vaccines could not be as safe as other vaccines that had been developed and used over several years.
Some participants did not perceive catching COVID-19 as a significant risk; typically, this was because they were younger and felt they were unlikely to either catch or develop serious symptoms from catching COVID-19, or because they felt they were already taking adequate steps to avoid catching COVID-19.
Those who were unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccine cited barriers including: not being able to find childcare to attend the vaccination appointment; not being able to travel to the vaccination centre; or having existing physical or mental health conditions that prevented them from receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
There was an appetite for more information about COVID-19 vaccines, particularly: side effects; contents; how they had been developed; and differences between, and safety of, the various COVID-19 vaccines.
Some participants accessed information about COVID-19 vaccines from social media or unverified sources as well as, or instead of, mainstream media; this gave them cause for concern, for example, about the contents or side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.

348,"Vaccination rates in England are lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population
Among adults aged 50 years and over in England, those identifying as Black Caribbean and Black African were the least likely to have received the first dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine by 12 April 2021 (66.8% and 71.2% respectively), followed by those from a Pakistani background (78.4%). This compares with 93.7% of the White British population. 
The differences between ethnic groups remain even after accounting for variations in where people lived, underlying health conditions, and measures of socio inequality. 
Separate data for Great Britain show that 30% of Black or Black British adults were hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccines in the period 31 March to 25 April 2021. This had improved since the start of the year but remained the highest among all ethnic groups. Vaccine hesitancy refers to those who have either declined a COVID-19 vaccine offer, report being unlikely to accept a vaccine or report being undecided.
Vaccination rates also differed by religious affiliation, with the lowest rate being among those who identified as Muslims (78.8%), followed by Buddhists (83.3%). The highest rate was seen among Christians (93.2%).
There was a relationship between proficiency in English language (as recorded in 2011 Census) and vaccination rates. The lowest rates were observed for those who did not speak English at all (75.3%) and those who did not speak English well (75.9%), compared with 92.7% for those whose main language was English. 
Meanwhile, people living in more deprived areas, those who have never worked or were long-term unemployed, those with no qualifications and those who did not own their own home all had lower vaccination rates than their more advantaged counterparts.

Vaccination rates also differed by religious affiliation, with the lowest rates being among those who identified as Muslim (78.8%) and Buddhist (83.3%); after adjusting for geography, socio-demographic factors and underlying health conditions, those identifying as Sikh and Hindu had a higher probability of being vaccinated than those in the Christian group.
There was a relationship between proficiency in English language, as recorded in the 2011 Census, and vaccination rates; the lowest vaccination rates were for those who do not speak English at all (75.3%) and those who do not speak English well (75.9%), compared with 92.7% for those whose main language is English.
There were lower vaccination rates among those in less advantaged socio-economic groups; people living in more deprived areas, those who have never worked or are long-term unemployed, those with no qualifications and those who do not own their own home all had lower vaccination rates than their more advantaged socio-economic class counterparts.
Disabled people who reported being “limited a lot” in their day-to-day activities had lower rates of vaccination (89.3%) compared with those who were non-disabled (92.3%); this disparity between disabled and non-disabled groups was greater within those aged 50 to 69 years than those aged 70 years and over.
Statistical modelling shows that the lower rates of vaccination in ethnic minorities, certain religious groups, disabled people and less advantaged socio-economic groups are not fully explained by differences in other geographical and socio-demographic factors or underlying health conditions.

349,"Record number of alcohol-specific deaths in 2020
There were 7,423 deaths from alcohol-specific causes registered in England and Wales in 2020, equivalent to 13.0 per 100,000 people. The provisional estimates for the number and rate of alcohol-specific deaths in 2020 were the highest since records began in 2001. 
The number of alcohol-specific deaths in 2020 was 19.6% higher than in 2019 (6,209 deaths; 11.0 per 100,000 people). This year-on-year increase was also a record – between 2001 and 2019, the number of alcohol-specific deaths increased by an average of 2.1% each year. 
When comparing the same quarter across the years, the rate of alcohol-specific deaths in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020 was statistically similar to rates in previous years. However, rates in Quarter 2 (Apr to June), Quarter 3 (July to Sept) and Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 – after the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic – were all statistically significantly higher than in any other year back to 2001. 
The difference between 2019 and 2020 widened in each successive quarter; the age-standardised rate in 2020 was 8.5% higher in Quarter 1, 17.4% higher in Quarter 2, 21.9% higher in Quarter 3 and 28.3% higher in Quarter 4, than in the equivalent quarter of 2019. 
Data from Public Health England show that a rise in consumption in older age groups is likely to have driven the rise in alcohol-specific deaths. 
Alcohol consumption in younger age groups has decreased significantly during the pandemic period, but this is not reflected in the death rate because of the relatively low chance of young people dying from alcohol-specific causes. 
Consistent with previous years, the alcohol-specific death rate for males in 2020 (17.6 deaths per 100,000 males; 4,891 deaths) was around twice the rate for females (8.7 deaths per 100,000 females; 2,532 deaths).

There were 1,963 alcohol-specific deaths registered in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) of 2020, and with an age-standardised rate of 13.6 deaths per 100,000 people, this was the highest rate for any quarter in almost two decades.

350,"The economy grew by 0.4% in February 2021
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by 0.4% in February 2021 following a revised fall of 2.2% in January 2021. 
Restrictions were in place to varying degrees across all four nations of the UK throughout January and February. Restriction announcements for each nation are available: 
 - England
 - Scotland 
 - Wales 
 - Northern Ireland 
The output approach to GDP shows that February’s level is 7.8% below levels before the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were seen (February 2020), and 3.1% below the initial recovery peak (October 2020). Overall, all main sectors of GDP remain below their pre-pandemic levels, but only services remains notably lower than the initial recovery peak in October 2020. 
Output growth in the services sector was broadly flat in February 2021 (grew by just 0.2%) as coronavirus restrictions remained largely unchanged; this follows negative 2.5% growth in January 2021. 
Overall, in February 2021, consumer-facing services were 18.6% below pre-pandemic levels (February 2020), while all other services were 7% below pre-pandemic levels. 
The production sector grew in February 2021, by 1.0%. This was mainly because of manufacturing output picking up for the first time since November 2020, as the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers grew following contraction in the previous two months. 
The construction sector saw growth of 1.6% in February 2021, driven by both new work and repair and maintenance.

Those aged 50 years and over had the highest redundancy rate across all age groups in the latest quarter (December 2020 to February 2021), with 9.7 per thousand within this age group being affected. This figure is up from 4.3 per thousand last year.
Over a quarter of redundancies for older male workers over the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were in manufacturing, while construction (the second most common industry for older men) had fewer redundancies at 8%. Around one-third of all redundancies for older female workers were in distribution, hotels and restaurants.
In the latest quarter, 29.9% of those unemployed and aged 50 years and over were in long-term unemployment, compared with 18.9% under 50 years.

353,"Industries related to pharmaceuticals were among those that have performed best throughout the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
Around 1 in 5 industries included in the Monthly Business Survey (MBS) were “resilient” during the pandemic in 2020. This is defined as industries that had a growth rate of at least -2% in total turnover between March to December 2020 and the same period in 2019. 
The chart below shows how these industries broadly behaved similarly to other industries throughout most of 2019. The two groups classified as resilient saw a large increase in turnover in March 2020 coinciding with the beginning of the pandemic, and subsequently a much smaller fall in April 2020 when compared with the other industries. 
Industries associated with pharmaceuticals performed particularly well. Turnover in the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations and wholesale of pharmaceutical goods increased by 19.4% and 13.5% in March to December 2020, compared with the same period of 2019. 
Half of the industries analysed in the education sector were resilient, whereas none were resilient in the accommodation and food and arts, entertainment and recreation sectors. While industries which could be linked to home and garden improvements performed the best, industries such as travel agents, tour operators and cinemas, performed the least well.

The increase in people meeting with other households has been driven by those meeting outdoors. The number of people meeting up indoors (either exclusively or in combination with meeting up outdoors) is currently at 10% and has remained relatively stable since January.
Nearly 6 in 10 (58%) working adults reported leaving home for work in the past seven days, a continued increase from last week (55%) and since mid-February (44% in the period 10 to 14 February 2021).
Following the easing of lockdown restrictions, more adults reported leaving home for a variety of reasons, such as: to meet up in a public place (33% among adults who left home compared with 26% last week) to shop for things other than basic necessities (28% compared with 20% last week) to do leisure activities (15% compared with 12% last week)

355,"Regional differences in the proportion of adults working from home during the coronavirus lockdown
The biggest increases in the number of adults who were working from home during the coronavirus pandemic were seen in particular household types in Scotland and the West Midlands.
Working from home was one of many ways in which people’s lives were affected in the regions and countries of Great Britain. Our analysis looks at the impact on households across significant points in the last year.
Workers living in one or two person households aged 16 to 64 years in London (70%) were most likely to report working from home in early 2021, whereas it was the North East where workers in similar households were least likely to report working from home (36%). 
The proportion of workers who reported they were able to work from home was similar in both the early 2021 lockdown (7 January to 28 March 2021) and spring 2020 (20 March to 31 May 2020). However, in regions across Great Britain, there were differences between the periods, particularly adults with children in Scotland where there was a 15 percentage point increase, and adults with children in the North East a 11 percentage point increase. For one or two person households aged 16 to 64 years, the biggest increase was by 10 percentage points, in the West Midlands.

Estimates for adults under 65 years combine responses from single adult and two person households where people are aged under 65 years.
Question asked: ""In the past seven days, have you worked from home because of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic?"". Base population: those who said they were working.
For this survey, a person is said to be working if last week: they had a paid job, either as an employee or self-employed; or they did any casual work for payment; or they did any unpaid or voluntary work.
Confidence intervals are provided in the datasets associated with this bulletin. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one estimate overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two estimates.

Working from home became a reality for working age adults throughout the pandemic, especially in London; the biggest increase in adults who reported working from home was seen in Scotland and the West Midlands. 
Households with children most frequently reported they were worried or very worried about the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on their lives, especially in London during spring 2020, where 84% of adults in these households reported this.
Positive sentiments on when life would return to normal were highest during spring 2020, especially among adults in households with children in the North West where 71% thought life would return to normal in less than a year, compared with the national average of 62%. 
The group that experienced that biggest change in perception were single adults under 65 years; 61% reported life would be back to normal in less than a year during the spring 2020 lockdown compared with 51% during the early 2021 lockdown; adults in Yorkshire and The Humber experienced the biggest change, a 27 percentage point decrease.
"
356,"People spent more time doing outdoor activities during lockdowns
The proportion of people leaving home for exercise increased during lockdown periods, as restrictions limited other leisure activities. 
New analysis of data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) suggests that the rise in exercise was at least partly driven by people working from home, who have been more likely to leave the house for exercise than those who travel to work each day. 
In July 2020, 46% of people surveyed by Natural England said they spent more time outside than usual during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Data from Natural England indicate that some people turned to nature to cope with feelings such as increased anxiety, with 41% of people saying that visits to natural spaces were more important to their wellbeing in May 2020 compared with before the pandemic. 
Decisions to make homeworking permanent by some businesses have allowed many people to think about moving closer to higher quality green space. Around 3 in 10 working adults (29%) responding to OPN in September 2020 said they intend to continue working from home after the pandemic. Of these, 12% said they had considered relocating, mostly to rural or coastal areas. 
Analysis 
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/howhaslockdownchangedourrelationshipwithnature/2021-04-26,"More than a year on from the first national lockdown in spring 2020, we look at how people's perception of nature changed during the pandemic and whether this is likely to continue as restrictions ease. 
26 April 2021
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced people to interact with familiar surroundings in new ways. While bedrooms have become offices, gardens – and the areas within walking distance of home – have become wildlife-watching spots and gyms. Nature has been a source of solace for many, as lockdown rules have heightened our appreciation for local parks and green spaces. 
Drawing on several sources, we look at the impact of lockdown on exercise levels, usage of public green spaces and the link between nature and wellbeing. 
Has the pandemic changed our relationship with the outdoors forever? 
During the first coronavirus lockdown, many people filled their free time with exercise. As restrictions limited other leisure activities, exercise levels increased. 
This could partly be down to higher levels of homeworking. New analysis shows that homeworkers have been more likely to leave the house for exercise during the pandemic than people with a daily commute. 
Around one in three workers (33%) were based exclusively at home in the spring 2020 lockdown (Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) survey, 14 to 17 May 2020); this had dropped to around one in five (20%) by late summer (26 to 30 August 2020), when restrictions had been eased. 
Between 7 and 11 April 2021, 28% of working adults worked exclusively from home. More than three-quarters (76%) of people who only worked from home in this period had left home for exercise in the previous seven days, compared with 52% of people who only travelled to work. Those working from home were also more likely to visit a park or local green space than those who travelled to work (45% compared with 30%). 
Data download
Along with the rise in outdoor exercise, people’s interest in nature surged. In May 2020, 36% of people responding to the People and Nature Survey by Natural England said they were spending more time outside during the pandemic than before. This rose to 46% in July 2020. 
Charities such as the RSPB and the Wildlife Trust saw spikes in web traffic in the first national lockdown. Visits to the RSPB website increased by 69% year-on-year in March to May 2020 with 79% of those users being new to the website. In the same period, the RSPB recorded a tenfold increase in views of its Build a bird box web page. 
When lockdown restrictions lifted in summer 2020, people relied on the outdoors for leisure time and their holidays. 
With children’s playgrounds and similar places closed during lockdown, visits to parks, and time spent in them, fell in the spring, but the subsequent increase during the summer was greater in 2020 than in previous years, according to Google mobility data for the UK. 
Data download
Similarly, while the British tourism sector struggled during summer 2020 because of limits on social contact, camping holiday sales surged year-on-year in July and August along with reports of higher sales of outdoor products such as bicycles, leisure equipment and campervans. 
While use of parks fell in rural and coastal areas during lockdown compared with pre-pandemic, there was a substantial rise in the summer, at least partly driven by domestic tourism. 
For example, visits to and time spent in parks in Cornwall increased by 4% between the start of the year and lockdown, but then went on to rise by 280% between the start of the year and September, with similar patterns in Devon, Norfolk and East Yorkshire. High Peak and Ribble Valley are notable as two rural areas that saw high mobility both during lockdown and in September. 
Data download
Isolation, along with other factors, contributed to a decline in mental health over the last year. 
This is reflected by lower personal well-being scores during lockdown periods – and throughout the pandemic – compared with before. However, there is evidence that the natural environment has helped some people to cope with negative feelings such as increased anxiety. 
Around 9 in 10 people surveyed by Natural England in May 2020 agreed that natural spaces are good for mental health and wellbeing. More than 40% noticed that nature, wildlife, and visiting local green and natural spaces have been even more important to their wellbeing since the coronavirus restrictions began. These percentages have remained stable throughout the pandemic. 
Local green and natural spaces have been important for well-being during the pandemicProportion of adults that have noticed or done the following since coronavirus restrictions were introduced, England, February 2021Source: Natural England – People and Nature SurveyNotes:Question: “Thinking about life since the coronavirus restrictions began, have you noticed or done any of the following?”Respondents can select multiple options so percentages will not sum to 100%.Download this chart Local green and natural spaces have been important for well-being during the pandemicImage.csv.xls
Green and outdoor spaces also appear to have played an important role in allowing people to see their loved ones during periods of isolation. 
The percentage of people increasing their time spent connecting with family and friends outdoors grew over lockdown, from 11% in May to 22% in July. This increase in summer persisted until January when it dropped to 19%. 
However, not everyone has equal access to the green space they need to improve their personal wellbeing. 
There is a clear connection between how people have been using the outdoors under coronavirus restrictions and the distance between green spaces and their doorstep. 
We can use Google mobility data to compare visits and time spent in parks and other natural spaces across different communities, during and after the first national lockdown. 
In lockdown, those living closer to their nearest public green space were more likely to visit than those living further away. In the summer, after lockdown, the opposite was true, with people living further away from their nearest green space more likely to visit than those living closer. 
Data download
Data also indicate a trade-off between private and public green space. Households in areas of the country with least access to private gardens are generally more likely to live close to a public park. 
In London, one in five (21%) households has no access to a private or shared garden, compared with 12% of households across Great Britain. And for those in London that do have access to a private garden, their gardens are 26% smaller than the national average. 
However, 44% of London residents are within an estimated five-minute walk of a park (this rises to 58% if playing fields are included). Both are the highest of any region or country in Great Britain. 
During the first lockdown in April, use of public green space increased in London (compared with a normal year), contrasting with falls elsewhere. The largest declines were seen in Wales and Scotland. This may be due to different restrictions in the respective countries – in normal times people in Wales are most likely to spend time outdoors. 
Use of parks was lower than normal in Wales and Scotland during the spring 2020 lockdownDifference between percent change in mobility to parks and public green spaces compared with a baseline period in 2020 and a normal year (0 represents use of parks in a normal year), 23 March to 4 July 2020 Source: Google – COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, Natural England – Monitor of Engagement with the Natural EnvironmentNotes:The chart compares data from Google (2020) with Natural England (2009 to 2018).

Estimates of normalised mobility for Scotland and Wales are based on seasonal changes in visit data for the whole of England.Download this chart Use of parks was lower than normal in Wales and Scotland during the spring 2020 lockdownImage.csv.xls
Of course, access to nearby green space does not guarantee that it is of sufficient quality (to want to spend time in) and size (to be able to maintain social distance). 
A significant percentage (around 40%) of the population were concerned about overcrowding and not being able to keep their distance from others when visiting their local green and natural spaces, according to analysis of Natural England’s People and Nature Survey by the New Economics Foundation (NEF). 
The average park in Great Britain serves just under 2,000 people, although some parks in densely populated areas such as London cater for many more people. Around 46,000 people in London have Clapham Common as their nearest park, more than 20 times the average. 
The NEF analysis that highlighted concerns about overcrowding found that around one in eight people (12.5%) don’t believe that their local green space is of a high enough standard to want to spend time in. People on lower incomes report greater dissatisfaction with the quality of their green space than those on higher incomes. 
The quality of nearby green space may have affected the way people spent their time during lockdown. According to our Time Use Survey, people in high-income households were spending twice as long keeping fit in April 2020 – through exercise classes and gym, running and jogging, team sports, and other sport – as those in low-income households (32 minutes per day compared with 16 minutes). 
Those from high-income households increased their time spent keeping fit by 36% during lockdown compared with 2015 (the most recent pre-pandemic data). In contrast, people from low-income households spent the same amount of time on fitness as before. 
Data download
The pandemic has underlined the importance of outdoor space, for people and policymakers. 
In October 2020, the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) asked companies about homeworking as a future business model. Around 1 in 6 (17%) businesses intended to move to homeworking permanently, with 61% of these pointing to improved staff wellbeing as a reason for the change. 
This could explain why our housing preferences are changing. Growth in sales of detached houses is outstripping that of flats. Meanwhile, Cornwall has overtaken London as the most searched-for location on Rightmove this year, with Devon and Dorset also in the top 10. 
However, the interest in nature that we saw in spring and summer 2020 has not necessarily carried through to winter 2020 and early 2021. A University College London (UCL) survey suggests that many of the lifestyle changes adopted during the first national lockdown had slipped, with people instead spending more time watching television, which may be unsurprising because of the colder and darker weather. 
It could be that the people most likely to maintain lockdown lifestyle changes, such as increased exercise and visits to green spaces, are those whose circumstances most allow them to, such as those whose workplaces decide to offer homeworking permanently. 
If businesses were to carry out their plans to continue offering homeworking following the pandemic, it could lead to an influx of wealthier people of working age (the demographic who are more likely to spend time in nature recreationally) moving to rural and coastal areas. 
Midway through September 2020, around 3 in 10 (29%) working adults said that they intend to continue working from home after the pandemic all or most of the time. Among those people, 12% said they had considered relocating, mostly to rural or coastal areas, places that typically have a high percentage of retired people. 
At the time of the 2011 census, the distribution of homeworkers was most concentrated in small coastal communities such as Tintagel, Porlock and Lynton in the South West (30 to 35%) and certain rural areas such as West Somerset, Ceredigion and Powys (22 to 26%). The 2021 Census, carried out last month, will provide data on how this has changed. 
Lockdown has disrupted our relationship with nature, from propelling us to find new appreciation for our natural surroundings to highlighting societal inequalities that exist in access to green space. 
Shifts in personal behaviour and corporate attitudes could mean that the UK, post-lockdown, will value and interact with nature on a much greater scale than before the pandemic. 
What we do not yet know is whether the changes brought on by lockdown will be a temporary trend, or a new way of life. 
Google defines “mobility” as visits to and time spent at a categorised area. The category of parks includes public gardens, national forests, campgrounds, and other outdoor spaces. This does not refer to the general outdoors found in rural areas. To understand mobility trends during the coronavirus pandemic, Google compares mobility on a given weekday to the median mobility on that weekday in a five-week period before the pandemic (the baseline). This baseline period is from 3 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. The mobility figure for a given day is the percentage change in mobility compared with the corresponding median for that day in the baseline period. 
The baseline period occurs in winter, when there are fewer visits to parks. Without coronavirus restrictions, we would expect visits to parks to increase in the spring and summer. 
Using historical data from the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey we attempt to normalise for seasonal changes in mobility to parks. MENE data cover England only and counts the number of short visits made by residents of a region. Estimates for Scotland and Wales are based on visit data for the whole of England. Google mobility data includes overnight tourism, so for the post-lockdown period where restrictions on overnight stays had been lifted, normalisation is less effective. 
The lockdown period referred to in this article is from 23 March 2020 to 4 July 2020. For each geography, an average percent change in mobility from the baseline is taken across all dates for which data are available. The number of dates from which an average is taken varies by geography. This is repeated for a post-lockdown period, which is from 5 July 2020 to 4 September 2020. Mobility data are available for all Google geographies in the lockdown period (350 Local Authority Districts and two Counties), but there are 13 geographies for which post-lockdown mobility data are unavailable. 
We use Ordnance Survey data to estimate access to local greenspaces across Great Britain. This is done at postcode level, with business and rural postcodes removed to show data for residential urban areas only. Urban postcodes are most appropriate for estimates of proximity to greenspace and linking with the google mobility data. We also provide data tables for all residential postcodes (including rural). This postcode level data are aggregated to larger geographies and weighted on LSOA level population data from the 2011 Census. Two datasets are used to measure the minimum and maximum level of public access to greenspace. One contains “parks” and “public gardens”; the other also contains “playing fields” which may be private. 
Access to private gardens data are matched to access to greenspace data on postcode. The average garden size for flats at postcode level are estimated from MSOA level aggregates. The average garden size for flats and houses at larger geographies are aggregated from postcode level and weighted on both LSOA level population data and the number of flats or houses in that geography.

357,"Inquest delays led to fewer suicide registrations in 2020
Fewer suicides were registered in 2020 compared to 2019, but this is likely because of due to inquests being delayed during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
All suicides must be investigated by a coroner, who holds an inquest to formally establish what happened.
This means there is a delay of several months between someone dying and a death being registered as suicide.
Overall, there were 4,902 suicides registered in England in 2020, a provisional rate of 9.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 people.
Around half of those suicide registrations were from deaths in 2020 (2,512 deaths).
The 2020 suicide registration rate is significantly lower than the rate of 10.8 suicide deaths per 100,000 registered in 2019, but these figures are unlikely to be reflective of an actual reduction in suicide deaths.
Inquest delays particularly affected suicide registration in the second quarter of 2020 (April to June), which had the lowest recorded number of suicide deaths since 2001.
As inquests resumed, suicide registrations increased in the third and fourth quarters (July to September and October to December) to levels similar to previous years.
The total number of people who died by suicide in 2020 will not be known for some time.

In Quarter 4 2020 death registrations, there were 17.7 suicide deaths per 100,000 males (1,085 deaths registered) and 5.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 females (376 deaths registered); these rates are similar to rates observed in the same quarter in previous years.
Taken as a whole, 4,902 suicides were registered in England in 2020, equivalent to a provisional rate of 9.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 people; this represents a statistically significant reduction in the rate from 2019 when there were 10.8 suicide deaths per 100,000, but caution is required in the interpretation of this decrease.
The reduction in the number of suicides registered in 2020 from the previous year most likely reflects delays to coroner inquests, because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as opposed to a genuine decrease in suicide.

358,"Monthly retail sales volumes rose above pre-pandemic levels as restrictions on consumer spending lifted
Retail sales increased in March 2021, reflecting some easing of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions on consumer spending. The quantity of goods bought rose by 5.4% compared with February 2021, and the amount spent increased 5.5%. 
Sales levels also rose above pre-pandemic levels, with the amount bought 1.6% higher in March 2021 than in February 2020. 
Non-food stores were the biggest contributor to growth in March, with clothing stores among the main drivers behind this contribution. Automotive fuel sales volumes also saw a significant monthly rise of 11.1% in March 2021, with government restrictions on travel eased on 29 March.

Non-food stores provided the largest positive contribution to the monthly growth in March 2021 sales volumes, aided by strong increases of 17.5% and 13.4% in clothing stores and other non-food stores respectively.
Food stores reported monthly growth of 2.5% in March 2021, with strong growth in specialist food stores (butchers and bakers) likely reflecting the continued closure of the hospitality sector during the Easter period.
Automotive fuel retailers also reported strong monthly growth of 11.1% as travel restrictions were eased towards the end of the reporting period.
Despite strong March figures, retail sales for the quarter have been subdued overall; in the three months to March 2021, retail sales volume fell by 5.8% when compared with the previous three months, with strong declines in both clothing stores and other non-food stores as a result of the tighter lockdown restrictions in place.
The proportion spent online decreased to 34.7% in March 2021, down from 36.2% in February 2021 but still above the 23.1% reported in March 2020; the value of online spending did increase in March, but spending in-store increased at a faster rate.

359,"Just over 8 in 10 young people reported positive vaccine sentiment
During the period 14 to 18 April 2021, 83% of young people (aged 16 to 29 years) reported positive sentiment towards a COVID vaccine, slightly down from 88% last week. This figure includes people who have either received the vaccine, are waiting to be vaccinated, or report being very or fairly likely to have the vaccine if offered.
This change appears to be explained by 8% of young people reporting they are fairly or very unlikely to have the vaccine if offered compared with 4% in the previous week.
Positivity around a vaccine among young people remains considerably higher than at the start of the vaccination programme when 63% of adults aged 16 to 29 years reported positive vaccine sentiment in December 2020.
Across the general population, positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccine remained high (93% compared with 94% the previous week).
Following the further easing of lockdown restrictions on 12 April, more adults reported leaving home for a variety of reasons, such as:
 - to shop for things other than basic necessities (20% of the adults who left home compared with 14% the previous week)
 - to do leisure activities (12% compared with 8%)
 - to collect takeaway food or drinks (18% compared with 15%) Over half (54%) of adults met up with someone outside their household, childcare or support bubble in the last seven days (57% last week).

This month we published our first provisional estimates of UK public sector finances for the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021. 
UK public sector borrowing in FYE March 2021 was estimated to have been £303.1 billion, £246.1 billion more than in FYE March 2020. 
While it was £24.3 billion less than official expectations (on a like for like basis), FYE March 2021 saw the highest public sector borrowing in any financial year since records began in 1947. 
Borrowing makes up the shortfall between spending by the government and other public sector organisations, and their income such as taxes. 
Central government tax receipts are estimated to have been £523.6 billion in FYE March 2021, £34.2 billion lower than in FYE March 2020, with notable falls in taxes on production such as Value Added Tax (VAT), Business Rates, and Fuel Duty. 
Over the same period, central government bodies are estimated to have spent £941.7 billion on day-to-day activities (referred to as current expenditure) in FYE March 2021, £203.2 billion more than in FYE March 2020. This growth in spending includes the £78.2 billion cost of the coronavirus job support schemes: the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and Self-employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). 
This substantial increase in borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt, which currently stands at 97.7% of gross domestic product (GDP), maintaining a level not seen since the early 1960s. 
It is important to note that these are not final figures; they will be revised over the coming months as we replace our initial estimates with provisional and then final outturn data, and as more information on the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic becomes available.

Public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks, PSNB ex) in the FYE March 2021 is estimated to have been £303.1 billion, £246.1 billion more than in the FYE March 2020 and the highest nominal public sector borrowing in any financial year since records began in the FYE March 1947.
Expressed as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP), public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks, PSNB ex) in the FYE March 2021 was 14.5%, the highest such ratio since the end of World War Two, when in FYE March 1946 it was 15.2%.
Public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks, PSNB ex) in the FYE March 2021 is estimated to have been £24.3 billion less than the £327.4 billion expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility in their Economic and Fiscal outlook – March 2021 on a like for like basis.

361,"CHAPS-based credit and debit card purchases reach 91% of their February 2020 average
The Bank of England’s Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) based indicator of credit and debit card purchases in aggregate increased by 8 percentage points in the week to 15 April 2021, to 91% of its February 2020 average. 
This was primarily driven by a 26 percentage point increase in “delayable” purchases (for goods such as clothing and furnishings) over the week. This period includes the re-opening of non-essential retail stores in England and Wales on 12 April 2021.
According to the Opinions and Lifestyle survey (OPN), of the 95% of adults that reported they had left home in the last seven days in the period to 18 April 2021, 74% of those did so to shop for food and medicine. This is broadly unchanged compared with the previous week. However, the proportion of those adults who shopped for things other than food and medicine in the last seven days was 20%, a notable increase of 6 percentage points from the previous week.
OpenTable estimates for UK seated diner reservations on Saturday 17 April 2021 were at 60% of the level seen on the equivalent Saturday of 2019. This is a decrease of 19 percentage points from Monday 12 April 2021, the day pubs and restaurants first re-opened for outdoor dining in England when reservations were at 79% of the level seen on the equivalent Monday of 2019. Figures for London and Manchester on Saturday 17 April 2021 were 44% and 85% of the levels seen on the equivalent Saturday in 2019 respectively.

362,"Regional differences in the proportion of adults working from home during the coronavirus lockdown
The biggest increases in the number of adults who were working from home during the coronavirus pandemic were seen in particular household types in Scotland and the West Midlands.
Working from home was one of many ways in which people’s lives were affected in the regions and countries of Great Britain. Our analysis looks at the impact on households across significant points in the last year.
Workers living in one or two person households aged 16 to 64 years in London (70%) were most likely to report working from home in early 2021, whereas it was the North East where workers in similar households were least likely to report working from home (36%). 
The proportion of workers who reported they were able to work from home was similar in both the early 2021 lockdown (7 January to 28 March 2021) and spring 2020 (20 March to 31 May 2020). However, in regions across Great Britain, there were differences between the periods, particularly adults with children in Scotland where there was a 15 percentage point increase, and adults with children in the North East a 11 percentage point increase. For one or two person households aged 16 to 64 years, the biggest increase was by 10 percentage points, in the West Midlands.
Percentage of workers reporting working from home, Great Britain, countries and regions, spring 2020 and early 2021 lockdown

Estimates for adults under 65 years combine responses from single adult and two person households where people are aged under 65 years.
Question asked: ""In the past seven days, have you worked from home because of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic?"". Base population: those who said they were working.
For this survey, a person is said to be working if last week: they had a paid job, either as an employee or self-employed; or they did any casual work for payment; or they did any unpaid or voluntary work.
Confidence intervals are provided in the datasets associated with this bulletin. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one estimate overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two estimates.

Working from home became a reality for working age adults throughout the pandemic, especially in London; the biggest increase in adults who reported working from home was seen in Scotland and the West Midlands. 
Households with children most frequently reported they were worried or very worried about the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on their lives, especially in London during spring 2020, where 84% of adults in these households reported this.
Positive sentiments on when life would return to normal were highest during spring 2020, especially among adults in households with children in the North West where 71% thought life would return to normal in less than a year, compared with the national average of 62%. 
The group that experienced that biggest change in perception were single adults under 65 years; 61% reported life would be back to normal in less than a year during the spring 2020 lockdown compared with 51% during the early 2021 lockdown; adults in Yorkshire and The Humber experienced the biggest change, a 27 percentage point decrease.

363,"An extra 1.5 million people in England have been identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to the coronavirus (COVID-19)
More than 2 million people were already on the Shielded Patient List because of their clinical condition or a clinician’s review.
In February 2021, the extra 1.5 million people were identified as CEV through the COVID-19 population risk assessment.
Our analysis shows that regardless of how someone was identified as CEV, the behaviours were broadly similarly in most cases. But in some ways, a proportion of the 1.5 million people who were identified as CEV by COVID-19 population risk assessment, behaved in a statistically significantly different way to those identified as CEV because of their clinical condition or a clinician’s review:
 - the newly-identified group were more likely to report not leaving the house in the last week (24%), compared with 17% of people identified by clinical condition or clinician’s review .
 - more than half of CEV people who had left home in the last seven days did so to go to the shops or pharmacy or to exercise.
Of those who had left their home in the last seven days, there was a statistically significantly higher proportion of people going to the shops or pharmacy in those CEV identified through the COVID-19 population risk assessment (64%) in comparison with those identified through clinical condition or clinician’s review (54%). Going to the shops and pharmacy, depending on circumstances, could be seen to be against the advice given by the government.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronavirusandclinicallyextremelyvulnerablepeopleinengland/22marchto31march2021,"Up until February 2021, there were 2.2 million people identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) in England because of their clinical condition or a clinician’s review; in February, a COVID-19 population risk assessment was undertaken and a further 1.5 million people were identified as CEV.
The total number of CEV people in England is now 3.7 million.
Half of CEV people who were aware of government advice to shield reported completely following the guidance (49%).
The majority (80%) of CEV people had left their home in the last seven days, when asked between 22 and 31 March 2021.
The most common reasons for CEV people leaving the home were for exercise, to go to the shops or pharmacy, and for medical appointments.

364,"Over the year the largest falls in payrolled employment have been in the hospitality sector, those aged under 25, and those living in London
Early estimates for March 2021 indicate that there were 28.2 million payrolled employees, a fall of 2.8% compared with the same period of the previous year and a decline of 813,000 people over the 12-month period. There was a small monthly decrease in the number of payrolled employees in March 2021; the largest monthly falls were seen at the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Of the 813,000 decrease in payrolled employees since March 2020: 
 - 355,000 can be attributed to employees working in the accommodation and food service activities sector
 - 223,000 can be attributed to employees living in London
 - 436,000 (53.7%) were under 25 years
Data from our Labour Force Survey estimate the UK employment rate at 75.1%, 1.4 percentage points lower than a year earlier. 
Homeworkers had a much lower sickness rate in 2020. The sickness absence rate for workers doing any work from home was 0.9% on average in 2020, compared with 2.2% for those who never worked from home in their main job.
In 2020, people working from home worked more hours of unpaid overtime than those who never worked from home: around 6.0 hours compared with 3.6.
Analysis
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/april2021,"The latest figures suggest that the jobs market has been broadly stable in recent months.
After a few months of increases, there was a small monthly decrease in the number of payrolled employees in March 2021. The largest monthly falls were seen at the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Over the year, the largest falls in payrolled employment have been in the hospitality sector, among those aged under 25 years, and among those living in London.
Data from our Labour Force Survey (LFS), for the three months to February 2021, are little changed on the quarter. Estimates show a small quarterly decrease in the unemployment rate while the economic inactivity rate increased, as it did during the first coronavirus restrictions; the employment rate continued to fall. With the reintroduction of many coronavirus restrictions, total hours worked decreased on the quarter.
The number of job vacancies in January to March 2021 fell by nearly 23% on the year; arts, entertainment and recreation, and accommodation and food service activities continue to be the worst affected. Growth in the number of vacancies has slowed this quarter although experimental single-month statistics indicate a strong increase in March and experimental statistics of online job adverts provided by Adzuna suggest a potential acceleration into April. The slowing down in the rate of recovery for job vacancies to March 2021 is more evident among smaller companies.
Annual growth in average employee pay continued to strengthen, the growth is driven in part by compositional effects of a fall in the number and proportion of lower-paid employee jobs.
56,000 fewer people were in payrolled employment in March 2021 when compared with February 2021.
The UK employment rate was estimated at 75.1%, 1.4 percentage points lower than a year earlier and 0.1 percentage points lower than the previous quarter.
The UK unemployment rate was estimated at 4.9%, 0.9 percentage points higher than a year earlier but 0.1 percentage points lower than the previous quarter.
The UK economic inactivity rate was estimated at 20.9%, 0.7 percentage points higher than a year earlier and 0.2 percentage points higher than the previous quarter.
The total number of weekly hours worked was 959.9 million, down 92.3 million hours on the same period the previous year and down 20.1 million hours compared with the previous quarter.
There were an estimated 607,000 job vacancies in January to March 2021, which is a 22.7% fall compared with a year ago.
Growth in average total pay (including bonuses) among employees for the three months December 2020 to February 2021 was 4.5%, and growth in regular pay (excluding bonuses) was 4.4%; it is estimated that by removing the compositional effect, the underlying wage growth is around 2.5% for total and regular pay.

365,"Homeworking went up by 9.4 percentage points in 2020
Of employed adults, 35.9% worked from home at some point during 2020, 9.4 percentage points higher than the level in 2019. 
The average gross weekly pay of workers who had recently worked from home was about 20% higher in 2020 than those who had never worked from home in their main job, when controlling for other factors. Prior to the pandemic those who had recently or occasionally worked from home earnt on average 23.4% and 12.0% more than those who never worked from home, respectively.
During 2020 the hours worked by home workers changed. In the early part of the pandemic (April, Wave 1 2020) homeworkers tended to keep hours close to typical office hours. However, by September (Wave 2 2020), homeworking schedules had shifted later, and homeworkers were more likely to work in the evenings compared with those who worked away from home.

Wave 1 reference period 28 March to 26 April 2020.
Wave 2 reference period 5 September to 11 October 2020.

Homeworkers had a much lower sickness rate in 2020. The sickness absence rate for workers doing any work from home was 0.9% on average in 2020, compared with 2.2% for those who never worked from home in their main job.

Lockdown measures eased across England on Monday 12 April 2021, allowing restaurants to open for outdoor dining. OpenTable estimates for UK seated diner reservations on this day were at 79% of the level seen on the equivalent Monday of 2019, the first time the level has exceeded 2% since before the latest lockdown was announced on 4 January 2021.

On 9 April 2021, total online job adverts reached 100% of their February 2020 average level - the highest proportion seen since 6 March 2020, according to Adzuna. This was partly driven by a notable increase to the “catering and hospitality” category, which reached 58% of its February 2020 average level on 9 April 2021. This is the highest proportion of online job adverts for “catering and hospitality” since 20 March 2020.

367,"A story of two recessions: productivity in 2008 and 2020
Productivity (labour productivity, multi-factor productivity, and public service productivity) declined in the first half of 2020 largely as a result of government restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).
Output per hour (one measure of labour productivity) and multi-factor productivity (MFP) declined in the first half of the year as a result of gross value added falling more than hours worked during the first lockdown, with businesses having to adapt to the new situation.
Both increased in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2020 as restrictions were eased – largely because of the shifting distribution of industries that continued to operate – but underlying productivity remained subdued.
With the reintroduction of restrictions on economic activity in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020, output per hour declined as gross value added recovered at a slower rate than total hours worked, while multi-factor productivity declined again as a result of shifts in economic activity between industries.
These changes contrast with the long and slow fall and recovery experienced following the economic downturn in 2008.
The fall in public service productivity (PSP) was much more severe than the corresponding decrease during the economic downturn in 2008. PSP fell by 0.5% during the economic downturn, whereas in 2020 the initial estimate of the fall in PSP was 15.4%. This is because of changes in the composition of public services to combat the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which did not occur in the 2008 to 2009 downturn. 
Government spending increased, for example on healthcare and personal protective equipment (PPE), while simultaneously output was negatively affected by school closures and cancelled non-urgent medical treatments. As a result of inputs increasing while outputs fell, public service productivity decreased.

Positive sentiment towards a COVID-19 vaccine remains high, with 94% of adults surveyed saying they have accepted at least one dose of the vaccine or will accept it when offered.
90% of 30-to-49 year-olds had positive sentiment towards a vaccine - slightly down from the high of 93% for this age group, seen in the period 24 to 28 March. 88% of 16-to-29 year-olds had a positive attitude to the vaccine, similar to the figures seen in recent weeks. These proportions were 74% (30-to-49 year olds) and 63% (16-to-29 year-olds) at the start of the vaccination programme in December 2020.

Compliance with most measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) remained high, with 87% (88% last week) of adults reporting handwashing when returning home, 97% (96% last week) using a face covering and 88% (87% last week) always or often maintaining social distancing when meeting up with people outside their support bubble.
The proportion of adults avoiding physical contact when outside their home was 85% (87% last week); this proportion appears to have gradually decreased since before the easing of lockdown restrictions began in early March (91% in the period 3 to 7 March).
95% of adults reported leaving home in the last seven days for reasons such as: to visit a park or local green space (30% among adults who left home compared with 25% last week); to visit a beauty spot, beach or landmark (10% compared with 6%); or to collect takeaway food or drinks (15% compared with 16%).
Almost 6 in 10 (57%) adults met up with someone outside their household, childcare or support bubble in the last seven days (49% last week), continuing the increase in this proportion seen in recent weeks following easing to lockdown restrictions; this 57% was made up of: 2% who met indoors only; 46% who met outdoors only; and 9% who met both indoors and outdoors.
Over half (53%) of working adults reported leaving home for work in the past seven days, the same as last week but a notable increase since mid-February (44% in the period 10 to 14 February 2021).
Personal well-being levels were relatively stable for most measures including: life satisfaction (6.9 this week, 7.3 in February 2020 before first coronavirus lockdown), feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile (7.3 this week, 7.6 in February 2020), and anxiety (3.9 this week, 3.5 in February 2020); happiness reached its highest level since summer 2020 last week (7.2) before decreasing this week (6.9).
Positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccines remained high; 94% of adults reported they had now either received a vaccine or would be likely to have a vaccine if offered – the same as last week.
9 in 10 (90%) people aged 30 to 49 years reported positive vaccine sentiment – the same as last week after this proportion had fallen slightly from a recent high of 93% in the period 24 to 28 March; almost 9 in 10 (88%) people aged 16 to 29 years reported similarly; this proportion has been relatively stable in recent weeks (the proportions were 74% among those aged 30 to 49 years, and 63% among those aged 16 to 29 years at the start of the vaccination programme in December 2020).

369,"Shopping, work or education were among the main reasons for leaving self-isolation
Approximately 8 in 10 (82%) people who were required to self-isolate due to coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms or a positive test reported fully adhering to the requirements.
Non-adherent behaviour was more likely to take place in the period between the onset of symptoms and receiving a positive test result.
Data collected between 8 and 13 March 2021 show a minority of people (17%) reported at least one activity that was not adherent to the self-isolation requirements, such as leaving home.
The main reasons given for leaving home during self-isolation included going to the shops and going to work, school or university.

Of those who had symptoms before being tested, 79% reported adhering to self-isolation requirements between the onset of symptoms and receiving a positive COVID-19 test result.
In the 24 hours following a positive result, 97% of all those who tested positive reported adhering to the requirements; in the period after the first 24 hours until the end of self-isolation at day 10, 94% reported being adherent.
The majority (83%) of those who tested positive for COVID-19 reported having no contact with non-household members while they had any symptoms of illness or during the self-isolation period.
Approximately a third (36%) of those who tested positive reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their well-being and mental health.
Approximately 3 in 10 people (28%) reported having lost income because of self-isolation.

370,"How different people respond to coronavirus guidance
Fear of the virus and passing it on to others, especially vulnerable people, were among the factors that motivated compliance with the coronavirus (COVID-19) guidelines.
The impact on mental health was one of the reasons some people had for “breaking the rules”, especially in relation to social mixing.
A study by IFF Research, commissioned by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), interviewed 180 people, 90 of whom kept diaries, from a range of adult social groups about their experiences following the guidance.
The groups included young people, students, ethnic minority groups, high-income workers, low-income workers, and parents with dependent children.
There was widespread willingness among participants to reduce the spread of the coronavirus by following official guidance.
A few did not trust the seriousness of the virus or questioned the effectiveness of the COVID-19 guidance.
Some participants, particularly from the young people group, mentioned a concern that the lack of socialising had a negative impact on their mental wellbeing.
Analysis

In interviews and diaries, people from different social groups describe in their own words what influenced them to follow – or not follow – the guidance. 
12 April 2021
Washing hands, covering faces and keeping two metres apart (“hands, face, space”) became a way of life during the coronavirus pandemic. And during lockdowns, so did keeping away from friends and loved ones.
In a study, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) sought to understand what influences people to follow the guidance or not, and how this differs between social backgrounds – students, young people, ethnic minorities, parents with dependent children, high income workers and low-income workers. We commissioned IFF Research to interview 180 people between 23 December 2020 and 22 January 2021, 90 of whom also kept diaries. 
On the whole, people's compliance was high but there were some factors that led to some participants not complying, which we explore below. From fear of the virus and a desire to protect the vulnerable, to concerns about their mental health and confusion about what they should and should not do, several factors influenced how people followed the guidance. The challenge is also reflected in data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) from 7 to 31 January 2021. 
Guidance on mixing with friends and family, which has changed at different stages of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, was something some of the people interviewed struggled with. While many were aware of the need to wash hands, cover their faces indoors in public, and keep their distance from others, some did not see why they could not meet friends and family indoors at home.

Social distancing goes out of the window when we meet up. We may as well hug, we've been sitting next to each other for two hours.
The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) data from January 2021 show that, among all adults that have met up with people indoors or outdoors, outside of their support bubble or household, 90% said they always or often maintained social distancing. This fell to 74% among young people (aged 18 to 24 years), 83% among ethnic minority groups and 86% among those on low incomes (£8,700 a year or less). 
There was high compliance across all the groups for wearing face coverings, with an average of 96% of all adults that had left their home in the past seven days saying they used them. The lowest compliance with face coverings appeared to be among 18-to 24-year-olds at 93%. Among those who left home in the past seven days, young people also appeared to be the least likely to say they always or often washed their hands after returning home, at 84% compared with an average for all adults of 90%. 
Estimates in the OPN are provided from a sample survey. Confidence intervals are included in the datasets to present the sampling variability, and comparisons should be made with caution.

Some people questioned why the guidance at certain times allowed people to be in pubs and shops but did not allow families to mix in homes. They therefore concluded meeting with friends was “safe enough”, even though it was not permitted. 
Data from the OPN show that compliance with the guidance on physical contact was high across all social groups. However, among those who left their home in the past seven days, a lower percentage of young people (aged 18 to 24 years) and ethnic minority groups (both 89%) avoided physical contact when outside their home, compared to 93% of all adults.

Some students and young people were concerned about the effects on their mental well-being of not being able to socialise, while many parents were worried about the effect of lockdown on their children.
Data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) for 13 to 17 January 2021 show a higher percentage of those aged 16 to 29 years (70%) reported that their well-being was affected by the pandemic compared with other age groups (62%, 48% and 39% of those aged 30 to 49 years, 50 to 69 years and 70 years and over, respectively). 
Separate analysis has also shown places with younger populations or higher rates of unemployment tended to have higher rates of loneliness.

According to the OPN, the proportion of adults meeting up outdoors has increased since the end of January 2021, with 31% saying they had done so in the week ending 28 March 2021. The proportion of adults meeting other people indoors was around 10%, which is similar to the level at the end of January. However, changes to the questions in the latest period may have contributed to the proportion changes seen between 24 and 28 March 2021 and should be treated with caution.

Most parents were interviewed before schools were told to return to remote learning for the latest national lockdown in January 2021. However, many of them recalled their experiences during the spring 2020 lockdown. When schools closed to most pupils (except vulnerable children or the children of keyworkers), data from the OPN showed many of them felt it was affecting their children’s wellbeing as well as their own. 
Fear of passing on the virus, especially to the vulnerable, motivated many participants to follow the guidance. Many saw it as the way back to being able to see family and friends again.

According to data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), 86% of adults said they had avoided contact with older people or other vulnerable people because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic shortly after the third national lockdown began (7 to 10 January 2021). This has since fallen to 77% of adults between 24 and 28 March 2021. 
Some participants were demotivated from following the guidance when they thought others, including friends and peers or those in the public eye, were not following the guidance. This was felt across all groups.

Some of these findings are similar to those recorded by the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) during January 2021. Overall, 30% of adults reported they did not have enough information about government plans to manage the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This rose to 46% of those aged 18 to 24 years and those aged 25 to 34 years, and 35% of people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Among the different income groups the highest income group (£36,500 a year or more) were the most likely to say they did not have enough information about government plans to manage the pandemic (36%).

Many students felt that the virus was not a threat in their university environment. Some knew people who had had the coronavirus (COVID-19) but not been seriously affected. They concluded they would recover easily if they caught it and saw no harm in attending parties or mixing in groups.

According to data from the Student COVID Insights Study (SCIS), from January 2021, university students reported a lower level of life satisfaction than the general population. Between 8 and 18 January 2021, the average life satisfaction score for students was 4.6 out of 10. This has since risen to 5.2 between 12 and 22 March 2021. A similar trend was seen for the adult population, with life satisfaction increasing from an average of 6.4 out of 10 between 7 and 10 January 2021 to 6.8 between 10 and 14 March 2021.

While the rollout of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines meant a few participants could see a day when restrictions would end, many believed they would stay in place, and many said it would not change their behaviour when it came to following the guidance. 
Data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) show that 28% of people thought it would take more than a year for life to return to normal in the week ending 28 March 2021. This compares with 25% who thought it would take this long when surveyed between 13 and 17 January 2021, around the same time as the interviews took place. The percentage fell to 20% in late February and early March before rising again.

There were concerns from some of the people in the study about the vaccines, with some undecided about having them, and a few saying they would refuse them. Data from the OPN show vaccine hesitancy is highest in younger people. Between 13 January and 7 February 2021, 17% of people aged 16 to 29 years expressed hesitancy about having a vaccine, compared with 1% of those aged 70 years and over. The percentage of those aged 16 to 29 years reporting vaccine hesitancy decreased to 12% between 17 February and 14 March 2021 but there was still hesitancy among some groups, including young people, Black or Black British groups, and those living in the most deprived areas.

This article is drawn from a qualitative analysis, intended to understand participants’ circumstances, attitudes and behaviour, rather than to be “representative” or measure the incidence of attitudes or behaviours. The term “many” is used when a view or behaviour is fairly widespread within a particular group of participants and “few” indicates findings applied only to a handful. “Some” indicates a middle ground between “many” and “few”. 
We have included data from the weekly Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) from 7 to 31 January, around the time that the interviews took place, to provide context for the quotes from interviewees. This analysis of compliance indicators was provided by age, ethnicity, income and parental status. 

The study defined high-income participants as those with an annual household income of £47,000 a year after tax. The OPN's highest income bracket is an individual's income of £36,500 a year or more before tax. For low-income workers, the study defines this as a household income of £18,000 a year after tax, while the OPN’s lowest income bracket was an individual who had an income of £8,700 a year or less before tax. Personal annual gross income is self-reported on the OPN survey and therefore should be treated with caution. A respondent’s income information does not represent equivalised household income, which takes into account all income from all household members, and adjusts for that fact that households with more people will need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members. 
A parent in the study is defined as someone who was a parent or legal guardian of one or more children aged under 16 years, while in the OPN data an adult is defined as a parent if they are the parent of a dependent child living in their household. This includes children and stepchildren. A dependent child is someone under the age of 16 years or someone who is aged 16 to 18 years, has never been married and is in full-time education.
The ethnicity disaggregation used has been chosen to provide the most granular breakdown possible, while producing robust estimates based on sample sizes, in line with the Government Statistical Service Ethnicity Harmonised standard.

371,"Retail footfall in the UK and traffic in London increased as coronavirus restrictions ease
Average daily traffic camera activity in London increased in the week ending 4 April 2021 compared with average levels seen in the two weeks immediately prior to the March 2020 lockdown. Motorbikes increased to 123%, pedestrians and cyclists increased to 109%, and cars increased to 103%. This rise coincides with the easing of restrictions in England. 
In the week to 3 April 2021, UK retail footfall increased by 9% compared with the previous week to 51% of the level seen in the same week in 2019, with footfall at retail parks fairing much stronger than at shopping centres and high streets. 
Meanwhile, in the week to 1 April 2021, the aggregate Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS)-based indicator of debit and credit card purchases increased by 10 percentage points compared with the previous week to 88% of its February 2020 average. However, this increase was partly driven by the usual increase in “staples” (essential goods such as food and utilities) seen around the turn of the month, as well as a continued increase since early 2021 in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors.

The percentage of businesses currently trading has increased gradually from 71% in early January 2021 to 75% in late March 2021, according to the final results of Wave 27. This is a similar level to that seen in July 2020, but lower than the 84% seen in mid-December 2020 (Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS)).
Out of the 94% of adults who reported that they had left their home in the last seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for things other than food or medicine remained low at 14% in the week ending 4 April (Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN)).
In the week to 3 April 2021, UK retail footfall increased by 9% compared with the previous week to 51% of its level in the equivalent week of 2019. Footfall was strongest at retail parks, standing at 85% of its level in the equivalent week of 2019 (Springboard).
Total UK online job adverts were at 97% of their February 2020 average level on Thursday 1 April 2021, only a slight increase from Friday 26 March 2021. Across all regions, job adverts either increased or remained broadly unchanged when compared with the previous week, apart from in Scotland, where they fell slightly by 1 percentage point (Adzuna).
On Monday 5 April 2021, the volume of all motor vehicle traffic decreased by 24 percentage points to 60% of the volume seen on the first Monday of February 2020. Note that Monday 5 April 2021 was a bank holiday (Easter Monday) and that a decrease in the volume of road traffic on this day is consistent with previous bank holidays (Department for Transport (DfT)).
Average daily traffic camera activity in London for motorbikes, pedestrians and cyclists, and cars in the week ending 4 April 2021 increased to 123%, 109% and 103% respectively of their average levels seen in the two weeks immediately prior to the March 2020 lockdown. This rise in activity in the latest week coincides with the easing of England restrictions which came into effect on 29 March 2021 and the Easter weekend (Transport for London).
In February 2021, the average sensor counts of vehicles over 11.66m in length (for example, larger lorries and coaches) on the Strategic Roads Network around English ports increased by 5 percentage points to 1% above their February 2020 level. This follows the recent dip seen in January 2021 (Highways England).
In the week to 4 April 2021, the average number of daily ship visits remained unchanged from the previous week at 356, whereas the average number of daily cargo and tanker ship visits decreased by 6% over this period to 101 visits (exactEarth).
There were 15,069 company incorporations in the UK in the week to 2 April 2021, an 11% decrease from the previous week and the lowest level recorded in 2021 to date. The main reason for this lower volume is the impact of the Easter bank holiday, as we are comparing a four-day working week with a five-day working week. Therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting this week's data (Companies House).
There were 5,170 voluntary dissolution applications in the UK in the week to 2 April, a 14% decrease from the previous week and the lowest level seen since the week ending 22 January 2021. As for incorporations, the same caution should be taken when interpreting this week's data for voluntary dissolutions (Companies House).

372,"A high proportion of disabled people continue to worry about the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic
More disabled people aged 16 years and over in Great Britain are worrying about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, compared with non-disabled people.
In the latest data (3 to 28 February 2021) around 8 in 10 disabled people (78%) said they were worried about the effect that the coronavirus (COVID-19) was having on their life, compared with around 7 in 10 non-disabled people (69%).
A higher proportion of disabled people (27%) said they were “very worried” compared with non-disabled people (16%).
This difference between disabled and non-disabled people is similar to when we have examined this at other stages in the pandemic, although the proportion of disabled people (83%) reporting worry has decreased compared with in September 2020.

Question: ""How worried or unworried are you about the effect that Coronavirus (COVID-19) is having on your life right now?"".
Base population for percentage: disabled or non-disabled popultion.
Collection periods: 3 to 13 April 2020, 14 to 24 May 2020, 8 to 19 July 2020, 24 September to 4 October 2020, 3 to 28 February 2021.
Lower and upper 95% confidence levels form a confidence interval, which is a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and shows the range of uncertainty around the calculated estimate. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one estimate overlaps with another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two estimates.

Disabled people said more frequently than non-disabled people that the coronavirus was affecting their well-being because, for example, it made their mental health worse (46% for disabled people and 29% for non-disabled people), they were feeling stressed and anxious (67% and 54%) or they were feeling lonely (49% and 37%).
Disabled people tended to be less optimistic than non-disabled people about life returning to normal in the short term: around a fifth (20%) of disabled people compared with over a quarter (27%) of non-disabled people thought that life will return to normal in less than six months.
Positive sentiment towards the coronavirus vaccine was high (94%) among both disabled and non-disabled people.

A larger proportion of disabled people (78%) than non-disabled people (69%), said they were worried (very or somewhat) about the effect that the coronavirus (COVID-19) was having on their life; for disabled people this proportion was lower than in September 2020 (83%).
Disabled people more often indicated coronavirus had affected their life than non-disabled people in ways such as their health (35% for disabled people, compared with 12% for non-disabled people), access to healthcare for non-coronavirus related issues (40% compared with 19%), well-being (65% compared with 50%) and access to groceries, medication and essentials (27% compared with 12%). 
Feeling stressed or anxious, feeling bored and feeling worried about the future were the well-being concerns most frequently cited by both disabled (67%, 62% and 57% respectively) and non-disabled people (54%, 63% and 52% respectively) in February 2021; feeling bored has increasingly been reported by both disabled (43% to 62%) and non-disabled (42% to 63%) people with well-being concern since September 2020. 
Among people who indicated coronavirus affected their well-being, disabled people more frequently than non-disabled people specified that the coronavirus was making their mental health worse (46% for disabled people and 29% for non-disabled people), they are feeling like a burden on others (25% and 10%), they are feeling stressed and anxious (67% and 54%) or they are feeling lonely (49% and 37%). 
Disabled people had on average poorer well-being ratings than non-disabled people across all four well-being measures (life satisfaction, feeling that things done in life are worthwhile, happiness and anxiety).
For both disabled and non-disabled people, life satisfaction and happiness ratings were poorer in February 2021 than in September 2020; compared with a period prior to the coronavirus pandemic (in the year ending June 2019), all well-being ratings of disabled and non-disabled people remained poorer in February 2021.
Disabled people tended to be less optimistic than non-disabled people about life returning to normal in the short term: around a fifth (20%) of disabled people compared with over a quarter (27%) of non-disabled people thought that life will return to normal in less than six months.
Positive sentiment towards the vaccine was high among both disabled and non-disabled people: 94% of both disabled and non-disabled people reported they had now either received at least one dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, were awaiting one, or would be likely (very or fairly likely) to have a vaccine if offered.

373,"Loneliness rates highest in areas with younger populations and higher unemployment
Areas with a higher concentration of younger people and areas with higher rates of unemployment have tended to have higher rates of loneliness in recent months.
We looked at results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey from October 2020 to February 2021 to find characteristics of areas that reported high rates of loneliness.
Places with a lower average (median) age generally experienced higher rates of loneliness during the study period, that is, a greater percentage of people in that area said they “often or always” felt lonely. Higher rates of loneliness reported by young people are particularly associated with urban areas outside London.

The map represents the percentages of adults aged 16 years and over across Great Britain who were asked how often they felt lonely and responded with ""often or always"". Other response options included: ""some of the time"", ""occasionally"", ""hardly ever"" and ""never"".
Local authorities with an underlying sample size of less than five have been suppressed, as indicated by the grey colouring.
Because of small sample sizes and large confidence intervals, local authorities should not be ranked against each other.

Data download
Living in a single-person household, difficulties with relationships caused by the pandemic, and not having anyone to talk to have also contributed to experiences of loneliness.
From October 2020 to February 2021, of those who said their well-being had been affected in the last seven days by the pandemic, 38.6% (about 10.5 million people) said it was because they were lonely. Accounting for groups we know are particularly affected by loneliness more generally, we found young people and single people have also been most affected by this seven-day measure or “lockdown loneliness”.
During the pandemic, how densely populated an area is has become a more important factor for anxiety in local authorities in England, with higher population density linked to higher rates of anxiety. Further research is needed but this may be because of concerns around social distancing and the perceived risk of infection.

7 April 2021
After a year of lockdowns, social distancing, and restrictions on travel and gatherings, some groups of people have reported high rates of loneliness and poorer well-being in recent months. 
Levels of loneliness in Great Britain have increased since spring 2020. Between 3 April and 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people (about 2.6 million adults) said that they felt lonely “often” or “always”. From October 2020 to February 2021, results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) show that proportion increased to 7.2% of the adult population (about 3.7 million adults). 
Mapping trends across the country also shows the types of places where a higher proportion of people felt lonely often or always, and differences in personal well-being. Areas with a higher concentration of younger people (aged 16-24) and areas with higher rates of unemployment tended to have higher rates of loneliness during the study period (October 2020 to February 2021). 
Local authorities in countryside areas also had a lower loneliness rate than urban, industrial, or other types of area. 
Places with a lower average (median) age generally experienced higher rates of loneliness during the pandemic, that is, a greater percentage of people in that area said they “often or always” felt lonely. Higher rates of loneliness reported by young people are particularly associated with urban areas outside London.
Data download
Age and marital status are known to be significant factors in experiences of loneliness. Pre-pandemic, those aged 16 to 24 years, renting, and single were more likely to say they often felt lonely than older age groups or those who were married. 
Previous research during the pandemic found nearly two-thirds of students have reported a worsening in their mental health and well-being. Over a quarter report feeling lonely often or always, a significantly higher amount than the adult population (8%). This is likely to be affecting loneliness scores for younger people in general at a local level. 
Living in a single-person household, difficulties with relationships caused by the pandemic, and not having anyone to talk to have also contributed to experiences of loneliness. 
From October 2020 to February 2021, of those who said their well-being had been affected in the last seven days by the pandemic, 38.6% (about 10.5 million people) said it was because they were lonely. Accounting for groups we know are particularly affected by loneliness more generally, we found young people and single people have also been most affected by this seven-day measure or “lockdown loneliness”. 
Data download
The odds of people who said they had no one to talk to reporting lockdown loneliness were almost 10 times greater than those who did have someone to talk to. Respondents who said they felt very uncomfortable leaving the house were also more likely to report lockdown loneliness compared with those who felt very comfortable leaving the house. 
One-person households were also more likely to report lockdown loneliness compared with two-person households. 
Data download
Unemployment has been closely tied to loneliness levels during the pandemic. This was one of the most important factors identified through our analyses. Local authority areas with a higher unemployment rate (as measured between October 2019 and September 2020) had higher proportions of residents who said they were often or always lonely (from Opinions and Lifestyle Survey results in the period from October 2020 to February 2021). Additionally, in areas where residents earn more on average per week, loneliness rates tend to be lower. 
The effect of unemployment on loneliness is particularly strong in urban areas outside London, while in London there is no clear correlation.
Data download
Higher unemployment in an area is also linked to higher average anxiety in that area as well as poorer life satisfaction. During the pandemic, the link between high levels of unemployment and poorer life satisfaction has become stronger.
Some aspects of where people live appear to be connected to people feeling lonely often or always. 
We partnered with the Centre for Thriving Places to identify local factors that might be connected to higher or lower rates of loneliness, as reported in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey.
Areas with strong local businesses and adult education tended to have lower rates of loneliness, modelling found that local authorities in London particularly benefit from these. 
Although it is unclear how many of the normal benefits of local business and adult education have been accessible during the pandemic, these features of life in London may be important in helping people to connect with one another. 
Places which tend to have lower crime rates showed lower levels of “lockdown loneliness” in the five months since October 2020 (people saying their well-being was affected by feeling lonely in the last seven days). The Centre for Thriving Places has a local safety measure based on crime rate. Comparing loneliness using this measure, lower crime rates in an area are connected to lower rates of loneliness. 
This was true in countryside areas which tended to see lower levels of loneliness than higher crime urban areas.
Data download
Loneliness has been linked to people feeling more anxious. Levels of anxiety have also broadly increased across most regions in Great Britain from pre-pandemic levels (the period April 2019 to March 2020 compared with April 2020 to September 2020). 
During the pandemic, how densely populated an area is has become a more important factor for anxiety in local authorities in England, with higher population density linked to higher rates of anxiety. Further research is needed but this may be because of concerns around social distancing and the perceived risk of infection. 
Local characteristics, as measured by the Thriving Places Index, are also connected to higher or lower levels of anxiety in an area, as reported in the Annual Population Survey. 
In the five months since October 2020, anxiety rates have increased particularly in areas assessed as having better quality provision for children’s education and educational attainment prior to the pandemic. This may relate to anxieties around home schooling, or worries about children falling behind educationally among adults in these areas. It is also noted that the age group of parents overlaps with the 25 to 44 years age group, which also reported higher ""lockdown loneliness"".
Aspects of an area that are associated with lower rates of anxiety include better general health and more opportunities for cultural engagement. These findings applied particularly to urban areas outside London.

374,"More than a third of adults met up with someone outside their household, childcare or support bubble
More than one in three (36%) adults in Great Britain had met someone not in their household, childcare or support bubble in the seven days to 28 March 2021.
Around 1 in 25 (4%) adults reported meeting up indoors with a further 5% meeting up both indoors and outdoors.
Just over a quarter (26%) of adults said they had met someone outdoors who was not in their household, support or childcare bubble during this period.
The findings come following changes to the way we ask adults to report meetings as part of the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey.
The following chart shows the proportion of adults who:
 - met up indoors (either exclusively or in combination with meeting up outdoors)
 - met up outdoors (either exclusively or in combination with meeting up indoors)
It should be noted that changes to the questions in the latest period may have contributed to the changes in proportions seen between 24 and 28 March 2021 and should be treated with caution.

Question: ""Excluding work or education, in the past seven days, have you met up with anyone from outside your household, support, or childcare bubble?""
Base: all adults.
Questions asked about meeting indoors and outdoors changed in the latest period so interpretation of this time series should be made with caution. For more information please see the datasets associated with this bulletin.

Compliance with most measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) remained high, with 89% of adults reporting handwashing when returning home and 97% using a face covering; both proportions unchanged from last week.
More people are leaving home in the last seven days than did in mid-January, for reasons such as: to visit a park or local green space (23%, compared with 14%); to meet up with people in a public place (14%, compared with 5%) and to shop for things other than basic necessities (13%, compared with 5%).
New questions this week showed us that 36% of adults met up with someone outside their household, childcare or support bubble in the last seven days, of which 4% met indoors, 26% met outdoors and 5% met both indoors and outdoors.
Over half (53%) of working adults reported leaving home for work in the past seven days; an increase from the 51% reported last week and a notable increase since mid-February (44% in the period 10 to 14 February 2021).
Personal well-being levels appeared to worsen for most measures including happiness (6.7 this week, 6.9 last week), life satisfaction (6.6 this week, 6.7 last week) and anxiety (4.0 this week, 3.9 last week); levels of feeling worthwhile remained unchanged (7.2).
Positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccine remained high; 95% of adults reported they had now either received a vaccine or would be likely to have a vaccine if offered; 94% last week.
Nearly 7 in 10 (68%) parents in England reported that their secondary school or college-aged child took part in rapid testing; the majority (85%) of which felt very comfortable or comfortable with their child taking part.

375,"Student well-being has improved slightly compared with earlier in 2021
English students’ average ratings of life satisfaction have improved since a lockdown lowest rating of 4.6 out of 10 in January 2021.
The recent rating of 5.2 for 12 to 22 March 2021, remains significantly lower than the average ratings of the adult population in Great Britain (6.8) over a similar period.
The Experimental Statistics from the Student COVID-19 Insights Survey (SCIS) show that fewer students reported a worsening in their mental health and well-being, dropping from 67% in February 2021 to 63% in March 2021.
There was little change in the proportion of students to report feeling lonely often or always (29%) between February and March 2021; this was a sizeable difference to the adult population in Great Britain during the same period, 7% of which reported the same feelings.
The data also revealed that 76% of students were living at the same address as they were at the start of the autumn term 2020. Of those who had moved, 49% were still planning on returning to their original address before the end of the academic year.
Almost a quarter (24%) of students said that they expected to stay with people who are not part of their current household for a period of two weeks or more, over the next two months. 
Please note that care needs to be taken when interpreting these Experimental Statistics as they come from a relatively small sample size and low response rate. Historical estimates have been revised to account for differences in the age structure between the sample and the student population.

376,"Housing affordability remains broadly unchanged in 2020
Housing in 2020 has become slightly more affordable in England than it was in 2019, thanks to an increase in earnings. 
The median price paid for properties in 2020 increased by 2.9% in 2020 compared with 2019, while earnings increased by 3.5%.
Houses in Wales became slightly less affordable during the same period, because of a 3.1% increase in the median price, compared with 2019, while earnings increased by 2.4%.
These changes in affordability were not statistically significant.
Housing affordability has worsened overall since 1997, with 8 of the 10 least affordable local authorities in 2020 in London. This has been driven by an increase in house prices.
The most affordable local authorities in 2020 were in the North West, Wales, East Midlands and Yorkshire and The Humber.
The gap between the most and least affordable local authorities continued to decrease in 2020.
At the local level, earnings increased by more than house prices in nearly 60% of local authority districts in England and Wales, leading to improvements in housing affordability in these areas. However, these were not statistically significant changes on the previous year.

Median housing affordability ratio refers to the ratio of median price paid for residential property to the median workplace-based gross annual earnings for full-time workers.
Data for annual earnings are not available before 1999 and for some local authorities in some years. For these years the earnings relate to annualised weekly earnings. Annualised weekly earnings are not produced on an identical basis to annual earnings and so care should be taken when making comparisons. Refer to the dataset accompanying this release for information on which ratios are based on annualised weekly earnings.

While these data show early evidence of change, they are not considered to be statistically significant. The effect of COVID-19 on housing affordability is likely to emerge once a complete set of earnings data become available in November 2021.

In Wales in 2020, full-time employees could typically expect to spend around 5.9 times their workplace-based annual earnings on purchasing a home; this is not significantly different to 2019. 
At a local level, earnings grew faster than house prices in nearly 60% of local authority districts, leading to improvements in housing affordability in these areas; however, these were not statistically significant changes.
In 2020, new dwellings remained less affordable than existing dwellings in both England and Wales.

378,"COVID-19 caused more deaths in 2020 than other infectious diseases caused for over a century
More than 140,000 people have now died in the UK with COVID-19 mentioned as the underlying cause or a contributory cause on their death certificates.
This includes more than 73,500 people in England and Wales whose deaths were due to COVID-19 — where it was the underlying cause — registered in 2020. Almost 4,400 further deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases were registered in 2020. COVID-19 is likely to be classed as an infectious and parasitic disease following the precedent of similar diseases, such as previous coronavirus strains (before COVID-19), and other viral infections.
This means COVID-19 was the underlying cause of more deaths in 2020 than any other infectious and parasitic diseases had caused in any year since 1918; that year there were just over 89,900 deaths from various infectious and parasitic diseases registered in England and Wales.
More recently, there were nearly 8,200 deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases in England and Wales in 2007. This coincided with a peak in deaths in England involving Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). 
This analysis uses causes of death defined as “infectious or parasitic diseases” in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), published by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This means it does not include deaths from influenza and pneumonia, which are categorised separately as respiratory infections. 
The analysis is part of a longer article looking at data from the previous 12 months, compared with other years, ranging from pressure on hospitals to the number of hours worked and people’s expectations of rising unemployment.

Winter is usually the most pressured time in the NHS with the colder weather coinciding with an increase in illness and death. 
However, the winter of 2020 and early 2021 was far from normal. Data from NHS England’s winter situation reports (SitReps), show that acute hospital trusts opened significantly more critical care beds, and that many more were occupied than in recent previous years, as hospitals reported greater pressure from the coronavirus (COVID-19). 
In the last week of January 2021, more than 5,000 adult critical care beds a day were occupied in hospitals in England, compared with around 3,000 a day in the same week in 2020. 
While the number of adults in critical care decreased in February 2021, it was still higher than any February over the previous decade. 
Hospitals also opened significantly more critical care beds than in recent winters, ready to care for people suffering the severe effects of COVID-19. Between 20 January and 5 February 2021 there were more than 6,000 critical care beds open each day. Throughout January and February between 2017 and 2020, the number of critical care beds open ranged between 3,500 and just over 3,900.

With up to 8.9 million people on furlough and many businesses unable to trade as normal during lockdown, the average number of hours worked in the UK per person per week fell to 25.9 in April to June 2020, compared with 32.3 in the same three months of 2019. This was the lowest since January to March 2008, when average weekly working hours were 30.9 per person. 
Accommodation and food services industries, which included people furloughed from closed pubs, hotels and restaurants, recorded a 54% fall in average weekly hours worked in April to June 2020, with 13.0 hours per worker on average compared with 28.4 in the same three months of 2019. Other industries saw less significant falls. For example, in financial, insurance and real estate services, where many workers were likely to be able to do so from home, the average in April to June 2020 was down 6% on the same period of 2019. 
By October to December 2020, average weekly hours worked had increased but were still down by 7% overall on the same period of 2019, with accommodation and food services down 33% as they were affected by lockdown measures, the tier system in England and rules on the numbers of people allowed to meet indoors.

The number of UK job vacancies dropped sharply as we entered lockdown, after 23 March 2020. 
The Vacancy Survey shows that vacancies fell 38%, from 701,000 in January to March 2008 to a low of 432,000 in April to June 2009 before rising again. 
In comparison, quarterly vacancies stood at 802,000 across the UK in October to December 2019 and fell by 57% to a low of 343,000 in April to June 2020, during the first lockdown. By October to December 2020, the number of vacancies had risen to 590,000, down 26% on the same three months of 2019. 
Most industries recorded fewer vacancies in October to December 2020 than the same period the year before. In the accommodation and food service sector, which had been affected by lockdowns and social distancing, there were 29,000 vacancies in these three months, down 66% from 86,000 in the same three months of 2019. 
From supporting the wages of furloughed workers to financial help for struggling businesses, the government has pumped significant funding into coronavirus support schemes. These, combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in gross domestic product (GDP), pushed public sector net debt as a percentage of the economy to levels last seen in the early 1960s. 
At the end of January 2021 public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) was 97.9% of GDP.

The value of UK exports, excluding precious metals, fell by 22.5% year-on-year from £170.4 billion in the three months ending July 2019 to £132.1 billion in the same three months of 2020, while imports fell 26.1% from £176.8 billion to £130.7 billion. 
This compared with an 8.8% year-on-year fall in the value of exports and 12.2% fall in the value of imports in the three months to July 2009 compared with the same three months of 2008, during the economic downturn. The data are in current prices and have not been adjusted for inflation. 
Certain commodities also saw significant year-on-year falls in imports and exports following the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Fuel imports in the three months ending July 2020 were down by 58.5% on the equivalent period of 2019 followed by a 41.3% year-on-year fall in the three months to October 2020. Lockdown restrictions and other measures, such as advice to work from home, led to reduced transport use, with fewer people driving and needing to refuel their vehicles. As 2020 ended, fuel exports were still down 47.5% and imports down 26.5% year-on-year in the three months ending January 2021. 
Exports and imports of machinery and transport equipment, which includes cars, vans and office equipment, were both down in the three months ending July 2020 (exports by 29.4% and imports by 27.9%) compared with the same three months of 2019, during the tightest restrictions. The easing of lockdown and subsequent increase in travel over the summer therefore contributed to the increase in exports and imports of machinery and transport equipment. Meanwhile, material manufactures, which include many metals and base materials — such as non-ferrous metals, iron, steel and goods manufactured using these items — saw only small falls in UK exports.

The average UK house price reached a record high of £252,000 in December 2020 — an increase of 8.5% over the year. 
Average house prices increased in 2020 despite the significant fall in gross domestic product (GDP) during the first lockdown. This differed from the 2008 and 2009 economic downturn, where GDP and house prices both fell year on year. 
This may reflect differences in the cause of each downturn. The 2008 to 2009 economic downturn was because of structural issues with financing mortgages. The fall in house prices in 2008 and 2009 reflects the impacts of the financial crisis on the cost and availability of finance, including for mortgages. Whereas the fall in GDP in 2020 was possibly driven more by reduced opportunities to spend, caused by lockdown restrictions, rather than primarily a lack of funds. 
The latest house price data, published on GOV.UK by HM Land Registry, may reflect the pent-up demand — from people who had been unable to buy during the lockdown — and changes to the types of property people wanted. In the UK House Price Index (HPI) data the average price of detached properties increased by 10.0% in the year to December 2020, compared with a 5.0% rise for flats and maisonettes. 
During the first lockdown, analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed one in eight households (12%) in Great Britain had no garden. 
Government support schemes may also explain some of the rise in house prices while GDP declined. Stamp Duty was suspended on the first £500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland from July 2020 until the end of June 2021. In Wales, the threshold for paying the Land Transaction Tax was raised from £180,000 to £250,000 until 30 June 2021. In Scotland, the threshold for starting to pay the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax was raised from £145,000 to £250,000 until 31 March 2021. Furlough schemes were introduced to limit job losses while mortgage payment holidays and a ban on repossessions have assisted homeowners in managing their mortgage repayments.

As more people reported their work had been affected by the pandemic, they also reported rising expectations for unemployment to increase, based on the scores in the Eurobarometer Consumer Survey (PDF, 137.8KB). 
The largest month-on-month rise on record in people's expectations for unemployment to increase was after March 2020, most of which was before the lockdown started. Expectations increased by 30 points (17.8 in March to 47.8 in April), followed by a further rise in May 2020 (49.4). 
This meant that people’s expectations for unemployment to increase reached the highest level in over eight years. The previous highest was in January 2012 (49.6), which followed the peak of unemployment after the 2008 and 2009 economic downturn. 
People's expectations of their financial situation for the next 12 months fell at the fastest rate since records began, down from 1.5 in the month up to March 2020 to negative 9.9 in April 2020, but recovered slightly in May (negative 9.0). The rating was slightly more positive in December 2020 (2.9).

Home Office data show police recorded crime in England and Wales was down by 19% with 1.25 million offences in the three months to June 2020 compared with 1.53 million in the same three months of 2019. Altogether the year ending September 2020 saw a 6% decrease in recorded crime on the previous year. 
Scottish Government data show police in Scotland recorded an 18% year on year fall in total crimes in April 2020, the first full month of lockdown, compared with April 2019. Over the three-month period April to June 2020 there were around 58,000 crimes recorded in Scotland, almost 9% down on the same period of 2019. Police Service of Northern Ireland data showed a 27% fall in recorded crime in April 2020 compared with April 2019. The three-month period April to June 2020 saw a 19% fall in recorded crime compared with the same months in 2019. Overall, recorded crime was down 5% in Northern Ireland in the year ending September 2020 compared with the year ending September 2019. 
Despite the overall reduction during the first lockdown, some categories of offence in England and Wales saw an increase. There was a 32% rise in possession of drugs offences recorded in April to June 2020 compared with the same three months of 2019 and a 24% rise in trafficking of drugs. Recorded stalking and harassment offences increased by 20% from around 118,500 in April to June 2019 to around 142,000 in April to June 2020. They continued to rise in the three months to September, with around 163,000 offences, 31% up on around 125,000 recorded in July to September 2019. 
Notable falls included a 74% drop year on year in recorded theft from the person in the three months to June 2020, a 47% drop in robberies and 51% drop in shoplifting. This coincided with the increase in time people spent at home during the lockdown period, reducing the opportunities for theft in public spaces and the closure of the night-time economy. Domestic burglaries were down 33% in the three months to June 2020, compared with the same period of 2019 and down 20% in the three months to September. 
Police recorded crime data in England and Wales are not designated official statistics and there have been improvements to recording processes and practices by the police, that have made substantial contributions to rises in certain types of crime over the previous five years.

379,"Recent lockdowns having less of an impact on economic activity than in spring 2020
The economic toll of lockdown has been lower in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021 than it was in spring 2020, with people adapting their behaviours and spending habits and businesses more likely to remain open in some capacity. 
Businesses within industries hardest hit by coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions – such as arts, hospitality, construction, retail and manufacturing (which together account for 22.7% of GDP) – have shown signs of adapting to public health restrictions. 
More than 80% of arts, entertainment and recreation and accommodation and food businesses were temporarily closed during the spring 2020 lockdown; this had dropped to around 55% during January 2021. 
In construction, around 30% of firms paused trading in spring 2020, down to less than 4% in early-2021. 
These changes are likely to be a result of businesses adapting, such as hospitality companies offering takeaway only, arts organisations streaming performances online and construction firms introducing measures to make their workplaces COVID-secure. In some cases, changes to Working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance would have also affected businesses’ ability to remain open in different periods. 
Our article compares several measures of mobility and economic activity across the main periods of coronavirus restrictions. 
Analysis

19 March 2021
The impact of lockdown on economic activity has been lower in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021 than in spring 2020, as people and businesses continue to adapt to life under coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. 
UK gross domestic product (GDP) – a measure of total economic activity – fell by 24% between February and April 2020, with the first national lockdown announced in late March. The impact of increased restrictions in subsequent lockdown periods was less severe – activity was 7.4% and 9.0% below its pre-pandemic level in November 2020 and January 2021 respectively. 
While guidance has varied across the nations and regions of the UK at different times, we have previously identified three main periods of public health restrictions: 
The Oxford Government Response Trackers’ Stringency Index assesses the different levels of restrictions across time. 
The smaller fall in economic activity under public health restrictions has coincided with increased mobility in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021 compared with spring 2020. This is according to Google’s indices of time spent and visits to workplaces, retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, and transit stations.

Together, the trends in mobility and economic activity suggest that the economy is coping better with restrictions in early 2021 compared with when they were first introduced in spring 2020. 
We look at five ways in which people and businesses have adapted to lockdowns.
Businesses within industries hardest hit by lockdowns – such as arts, hospitality, construction, retail and manufacturing (which account for 22.7% of GDP) – have shown signs of adapting to public health restrictions. 
More than 80% of arts, entertainment and recreation and accommodation and food businesses were temporarily closed during the spring 2020 lockdown; this had dropped to around 55% during January 2021. 
In construction, around 30% of firms paused trading in spring 2020, down to less than 4% in early 2021. 
These changes are likely to be a result of businesses adapting, such as hospitality companies offering takeaway only, arts organisations streaming performances online and construction firms introducing measures to make their workplaces COVID-secure. In some cases, changes to Working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance would have also affected businesses’ ability to remain open in different periods.
Across all industries, around 45% of the workforce have been operating from their normal place of work during the early 2021 lockdown, down from 51% during autumn and winter 2020 restrictions but up from 36% in the first national lockdown. 
This is supported by our previous analysis of behaviours during different lockdown periods, which shows the proportion of people travelling to work is up by around 10 percentage points in the early 2021 lockdown compared with spring 2020. Similarly, road activity observed from traffic camera data in London and the North East of England shows an increase of cars, buses, vans and trucks on the roads in the early 2021 lockdown compared with spring 2020.
While the proportion of people working from home has remained high since spring 2020 in industries such as information and communication, and professional, scientific and technical activities, other sectors less suited to work remotely have adapted to allow their staff to return to their normal place of work. 
For example, during the spring 2020 lockdown, around a third of construction staff were working on-site as the introduction of restrictions and uncertainty on their implications for the sector saw a temporary suspension of projects and closure of sites. As a result, output in the construction sector (which accounts for 6.4% of GDP) fell by 40% in April 2020 alone, the largest monthly fall on record, with an average of 42% of the construction workforce on furlough in this period. 
Under the autumn and winter 2020 restrictions and the early 2021 lockdown, building activity has held up much better, helped in part by additional guidance for employers to create a COVID-secure workplace. Official estimates show that the construction industry grew by 0.9% in January 2021 against the backdrop of lockdown restrictions. Around 59% of staff have been working on site and less than 5% have been placed on furlough.

High-frequency consumer spending data from Revolut provide insight into the relative impact of different UK lockdowns. With Revolut customers generally younger and more metropolitan than average with a fast-growing customer base of several million in the UK, spending may not be representative of the UK macroeconomic picture – we weight to adjust for this, alongside high user-base growth, and sectoral representation. 
Data from Revolut suggest that spending across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland dropped to lower levels during the spring 2020 lockdown compared with subsequent periods of restrictions. Average spending across the UK as a whole fell by 56% in the spring 2020 lockdown compared with pre-pandemic, as opposed to 17% under autumn and winter 2020 restrictions (boosted by seasonal spending) and 28% during the early 2021 lockdown. 
This is consistent across various categories of spending. Compared with a pre-pandemic baseline, the drops in spending on retail (including clothing and footwear shops), entertainment (pubs, restaurants and social venues) and fuel and transport (covering personal travel spend) were substantial in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021, although less severe than compared with spring 2020. 
This matches what we have seen in levels of workplace and retail and recreation mobility, which have remained higher in more recent periods of restrictions compared with spring 2020. 
Food and drink (including supermarkets and convenience stores) is the only category where spending has consistently remained above or around its pre-pandemic baseline across the four nations, with only Wales seeing slightly lower levels in the early 2021 lockdown. 
Notably, all nations saw food and drink spending spike amid uncertainty and panic buying in the days leading up to the spring 2020 lockdown. The spikes ahead of latter restrictions were far less significant, as consumers adjusted.

Across the different lockdowns there have been various restrictions on non-essential retail stores, which had an impact on the number of people travelling to access these services. However, much like overall economic activity, the impact of coronavirus restrictions on retail sales has lessened since the spring 2020 lockdown. 
Total sales values dropped to 6.5% below their pre-pandemic level in January 2021, a far cry from the 23.3% fall in April 2020. 
This reduced impact is partly down to an acceleration in the long-term shift by consumers towards online shopping. The value of online retail sales has increased markedly, largely offsetting the fall in in-store sales. 
Feedback from online retailers suggests that non-essential store closures have helped boost sales. As a result, the share of online retail sales rose to a record 35.2% in January 2021, up from 19.5% a year earlier in January 2020 and 34.1% in May 2020. 
The rise of online sales as a percentage of all retail has been consistent across sub-sectors, including food stores, that were able to remain open. With the help of click and collect services, the proportion of online food sales increased from 5.3% in February 2020 to 12.2% in January 2021. 
And this could be a culture shift: according to our recent Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), 21% of adults plan to continue doing more of their grocery shopping online once the pandemic is over than did so before, which rises to 33% for people shopping online for other things.

People have been making more journeys outside their local area in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021 than they did in spring 2020, according to Facebook data on travel between local authorities. The data may include travel for work, and there was a steep drop in mobility around the Christmas period. 
Despite the relative increase since last spring, travel between local authorities remained well below the pre-pandemic baseline throughout more recent periods of restrictions. 
Meanwhile, hotel occupancy rates in England show a similar trend up to the end of 2020 – rates were up across most regions in the autumn and winter compared with the spring. 
There was a surge in occupancy rates in some areas over the summer, amid increased demand for domestic holidays when restrictions were eased. The South West of England saw the largest rise while London recorded the smallest.

380,"Redundancies have increased faster during the coronavirus pandemic than during the financial crisis of 2008 to 2009
The rate of redundancies (redundancies per thousand employees) recorded in the UK since the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has already exceeded the highest rate reached during the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis. The pandemic and lockdown measures across the UK in 2020 caused businesses to close temporarily, which contributed to the aggregate redundancy rate increasing to a record high of 14.2 per thousand employees between July and November 2020, based on Labour Force Survey (LFS) data. 
Some groups of people have been more affected by the redundancies than others. For example, the redundancy rate for men (15.5 per thousand) was higher than that for women (12.8 per thousand). Of employees recorded as disabled, as measured by the Government Statistical Service, in the period July to November 2020, 21.1 per thousand were made redundant, compared with 13.0 per thousand of employees who were not disabled. 
With the closure of non-essential retail and hospitality alongside other restrictions to businesses, 71% of the redundancies in the period July to November 2020 were attributed by LFS respondents to employers cutting staff because of a loss of trade. The remaining proportion were equally attributed to either “employer closing down” or “other reasons”. Both coronavirus and EU exit-related uncertainties may have caused some employers to reduce staff.
Between July and November 2020, the industry with the highest redundancy rate was the administrative and support services industry (35.8 per thousand), followed by the “other services” industry group, which includes arts, entertainment and recreation (30.5 per thousand). As these services largely depend on face-to-face contact between people, the pandemic and associated lockdown measures significantly reduced the demand for workers.

381,"Highest rates of death in men who work in elementary occupations
Men working in elementary occupation groups, such as security or caring, leisure and other service occupations, had the highest rates of death involving COVID-19.
Analysis of coronavirus-related deaths by occupation in England and Wales, registered between 9 March and 28 December 2020, show they experienced 66.3 and 64.1 deaths per 100,000 males, respectively.

",https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregisteredbetween9marchand28december2020,"7,961 deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the working age population (those aged 20 to 64 years) of England and Wales were registered between 9 March and 28 December 2020.
Nearly two-thirds of these deaths were among men (5,128 deaths), with the age-standardised mortality rate of death involving COVID-19 being statistically significantly higher in men, at 31.4 deaths per 100,000 men aged 20 to 64 years compared with 16.8 deaths per 100,000 women (2,833 deaths).
When looking at broad groups of occupations, men who worked in elementary occupations (699 deaths) or caring, leisure and other service occupations (258 deaths) had the highest rates of death involving COVID-19, with 66.3 and 64.1 deaths per 100,000 males, respectively.
In women, process, plant and machine operatives (57 deaths) and caring, leisure and other service occupations (460 deaths) had the highest rates of death involving COVID-19 when looking at broad occupational groups, with 33.7 and 27.3 deaths per 100,000 females, respectively.
Men (79.0 deaths per 100,000 males; 150 deaths) and women (35.9 deaths per 100,000 females; 319 deaths) who worked in social care occupations had statistically significantly higher rates of death involving COVID-19 when compared with rates of death involving COVID-19 in the population among those of the same age and sex.
Almost three in four of the deaths involving COVID-19 in social care occupations (347 out of 469 deaths; 74.0%) were in care workers and home carers, with 109.9 deaths per 100,000 males (107 deaths) and 47.1 deaths per 100,000 females (240 deaths).
Men who worked in healthcare occupations had a statistically higher rate of death involving COVID-19 (44.9 deaths per 100,000 males; 190 deaths) when compared with the rate of COVID-19 among men of the same age in the population; the rate among women who worked in healthcare occupations (17.3 deaths per 100,000 females; 224 deaths) was statistically similar to the rate in the population.
Looking at specific healthcare occupations, nurses had statistically significantly higher rates of death involving COVID-19 when compared with the rate of COVID-19 among those of the same age and sex in the population, with 79.1 deaths per 100,000 males (47 deaths) and 24.5 deaths per 100,000 females (110 deaths); nursing auxiliaries and assistants also had elevated rates of death involving COVID-19.
Rates of death involving COVID-19 in men and women who worked as teaching and educational professionals, such as secondary school teachers, were not statistically significantly raised when compared with the rates seen in the population among those of the same age and sex. 
This analysis does not prove conclusively that the observed rates of death involving COVID-19 are necessarily caused by differences in occupational exposure; we adjusted for age, but not other factors such as ethnic group and place of residence.

382,"COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions fell in London, South East and East of England, but remained high
Hospital admissions and COVID-19 infections remained high, but fell in London, the South East and East of England in the week ending 17 January. Cases compatible with the new COVID-19 variant also decreased in these regions, which had seen high levels in recent weeks. 
Despite these decreases in the latest week, London still has the highest positivity rate among English regions at 2.89%, and the second highest hospital admission rate at 44.5 per 100,000 people. 
The North East recorded the second highest positivity rate, and saw the largest increase in hospital admissions, rising to 36.3 admissions per 100,000 people from 25.8 in the week ending 10 January. 
Deaths involving COVID-19 increased in the week ending 8 January in all English regions, with the largest increase and highest number of deaths seen in the South East.

383,"Coronavirus hits young and poorly-paid furloughed workers the hardest
Young people and those on the lowest incomes who were furloughed are more likely to have felt the impact of the coronavirus.
Estimates of personal and economic well-being in Great Britain, from March 2020 to December 2020, showed people under 30 years and those with household incomes under £10,000 were around 40% and 60% respectively more likely to be furloughed than the general population.
Young people and those on the lowest incomes were as likely to be impacted in this second phase, during November, as they were in the first lockdown. There was a six-fold increase in those aged under 30 years reporting that they had been furloughed, from 2.1% for the four days to 1 November to 12.3% for the period 4 to 8 November.
Those on the lowest incomes were also more likely to be furloughed over 2020. During 11 to 15 November, when restrictions were tightened in some areas of the country, 17% of people with a household income less than £10,000 reported that they had been furloughed. This compares with 2.7% of people with a household income of more than £40,000 who said they had been furloughed.

Of those who have not been able to work (either because of being on furlough or for another reason), over half (52%) of people in the top income quintile continued to be paid in full, while this was the case for only 28% of those in the lowest income quintile.
People with a job or seeking work were more likely to have decreased income during the pandemic, and particularly the poorest 20%, while others such as retired people out of the labour market were more protected.
Throughout the pandemic, employed parents were almost twice as likely to report a reduction in income than the general employed population, although this gap gradually narrowed throughout 2020 as schools reopened.
Self-employed people were more likely to report reduced working hours and reduced income, even if they had received support from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS).
By December 2020, nearly 9 million people had to borrow more money because of the coronavirus pandemic; the proportion borrowing £1,000 or more also increased from 35% to 45% since June 2020.
Impacts to household spending have been felt differently across groups, with parents less able to afford either a holiday or an unexpected but necessary expense than non-parents; they were also roughly 50% more likely to have difficulty meeting their usual expenses.

384,"UK debit and credit card purchases 35% below their February 2020 average
Today for the first time we are launching an experimental faster indicator for estimating UK spending using debit and credit cards.
In the week to 14 January 2021, aggregate Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) debit and credit card purchases were 35% below their February 2020 average, with delayable expenditure seeing further decline from the previous week to 49% below its February 2020 average.
CHAPS data from the Bank of England provide an indicator of UK companies’ transactions made by customers using both physical and online platforms. It includes data on debit and credit card purchases. CHAPS data represent a big step forward in seeing how short-term purchasing habits are changing.

The chart shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors “merchant acquirers” and shows that debit and credit card spending rose sharply over the festive period. CHAPS debit and credit card retail consumer purchases were on average 4% greater in December 2020 than in February 2020. This increase was driven by staples and delayable spending, such as in supermarkets and other retail stores, which typically increase in December.
Spending fell in the week following Christmas, and has remained relatively low for “work-related”, “social” and “delayable” expenditure. This coincided with the extension of Tier 4 restrictions in England on Boxing Day, and the start of national lockdowns in the UK on 5 January 2021.
