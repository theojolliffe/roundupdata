","Highest UK flight numbers since before first national lockdown
The number of UK daily flights has reached the highest level seen since the week to 22 March 2020 (the day before the first national lockdown was implemented across the UK).
Data from EUROCONTROL on international and domestic UK flights show the seven-day average of daily flights rose by 17% in the week to 25 July 2021 from the previous week, to 2,877 daily flights.
The average number of daily flights in the latest week is 147% of the level seen in the equivalent week in 2020 (when UK travel corridors were in place). However, it is still less than half (43%) of the level seen in the equivalent week in 2019.

Results presented in this bulletin are experimental and may be subject to revision. 



Initial results from Wave 35 of the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) cover the reference period 28 June to 11 July 2021, with a response rate of 19.7% (7,650 responses). The survey was live for the period 12 to 20 July 2021.

In the last two weeks (at the point at which they responded), currently trading UK businesses reported that 11% of their workforce have moved from furlough or fully homeworking to a hybrid model of working, unchanged from the previous wave. Further, an extra 9% of the workforce that were on partial or full furlough are fully back to where they were working before the pandemic.
Across all UK industries in Wave 35:
87% of businesses had been trading for more than the last two weeks
1% of businesses had started trading within the last two weeks after a pause in trading
3% of businesses had paused trading but intend to restart in the next two weeks (broadly unchanged from Wave 34)
6% of businesses had paused trading and do not intend to restart in the next two weeks (unchanged from Wave 34)
3% of businesses had permanently ceased trading (unchanged from Wave 34)
These data are daily flight figures from the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL). Daily flight numbers for the UK alongside other countries are available in EUROCONTROL's dashboard. EUROCONTROL is a pan-European, civil-military organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation. Its Aviation Intelligence and Performance Review Unit provides independent collection and validation of air navigation services performance-related data and intelligence gathering.
These flights data include international arrivals and departures to and from the UK (including Crown Dependencies) and domestic UK flights, but exclude overflights (flights that pass over UK territory). They capture all flight movements that operate under Instrumental Flight Rules (IFR), where the pilot uses instruments in the flight deck to control, guide and adjust the plane. This includes commercial flights carrying passengers and cargo as well as non-commercial flights such as private and military flights.
Data from EUROCONTROL do not include information on the volume of passengers or cargo carried on UK flights. Especially in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, flights might not be operating at full capacity and therefore trends in passengers and cargo will differ from trends in flights presented here.

In 2019, the total number of flights from, to and within the UK ranged from approximately 5,000 per day in quieter months to over 6,500 per day in peak holiday season. However, after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised against all non-essential international travel (17 March 2020) and the UK first went into lockdown (23 March 2020), the number of flights fell to a low of around 500 per day at the start of April 2020, approximately 10% of what they were in the equivalent period of 2019.
In early 2021, flights were steady at around 1,000 per day (approximately 20% of their equivalent 2019 levels). From mid-May 2021 and as the green list of countries was introduced (17 May 2021), flights have gradually increased.
In the week ending 18 July 2021, the seven-day average number of daily flights was 2,456. This is a 6% increase from 2,307 in the previous week (week ending 11 July 2021). The average number of flights in the latest week is 50% higher than the corresponding figure for the equivalent week in 2020 (a time when UK travel corridors were in place), but remains around one-third of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019.
The full data time series available for UK flights can be found in the accompanying dataset, which contains daily flight numbers and the rolling seven-day averages.
These data series are experimental faster indicators for estimating UK spending on credit and debit cards. They track the daily CHAPS payments made by credit and debit card payment processors to around 100 major UK retail corporates. These payments are the proceeds of recent credit and debit card transactions made by customers at their stores, both through physical and online platforms. More information on the indicator is provided in the accompanying methodology article.
Companies are allocated to one of four categories based on their primary business. These are:
""staples"" - companies that sell essential goods that households need to purchase, such as food and utilities
""work-related"" ­- companies providing public transport or selling petrol
""delayable"" - companies selling goods whose purchase could be delayed, such as clothing or furnishings
""social"" ­- spending on travel and eating out

Source: ONS and Bank of England calculations 

Notes:

Users should note the daily payment data is the sum of card transactions processed up to the previous working day, so there is slight time lag when compared with real-life events on the chart.
The vertical lines indicate key events. In order, the events are: first national lockdown begins; some non-essential shops allowed to reopen; regional restrictions begin in England; Christmas period; lockdowns announced in England and Scotland; reopening of non-essential shops, and outdoor pubs and restaurants in England; further easing of lockdown restrictions, including re-opening of indoor pubs and restaurants in England.
Percentage point difference is derived from current week and previous week index before rounding.

Figure 3 shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors, ""merchant acquirers"".
In the week to 15 July 2021, the aggregate CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases decreased by 5 percentage points from the previous week to 92% of its February 2020 average level. The ""staple"", ""delayable"" and ""social"" spending categories fell by 8, 6 and 2 percentage points, respectively. ""Work related"" spending remained broadly unchanged from the previous week. Despite this, ""delayable"", ""social"" and ""work related"" spending are still substantially higher than the levels seen at the beginning of 2021 (week ending 7 January 2021), having risen by 32, 40 and 56 percentage points, respectively, over that period.
In the latest week, ""work related"" and ""staple"" spending were above their February 2020 average levels, at 110% and 102%, respectively. Conversely, ""delayable"" and ""social"" spending were both at 85% of their February 2020 average levels.
These figures are experimental estimates of online job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, by category, by UK country and English region. The number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour. The Adzuna categories used do not correspond to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Vacancy Survey.

According to Adzuna, on 16 July 2021, the total volume of online job adverts in the UK saw a very slight increase of 1% when compared with the previous week (9 July 2021). This was driven by small increases in the number of online job adverts across most categories.
Of the 28 categories, 19 saw week-on-week growth in the latest week, the largest of which was in the ""part-time/weekend"" category, which grew by 6% following a 9% decrease in the previous week (9 July 2021). Three categories were broadly unchanged, with six seeing week-on-week falls in the number of job adverts. The largest weekly decrease was in ""customer service/support"", which fell by 10%.
On 16 July 2021, the total volume of online job adverts relative to its February 2020 average level remained broadly unchanged from the previous week at 130%. This is 7 percentage points higher than the equivalent figure in the same week of 2019. Of the 28 categories, and for the second consecutive week, the only three that were below their February 2020 average levels were ""energy, oil and gas"", ""legal"" and ""graduate"", at 87%, 95% and 99%, respectively.
The ""transport/logistics/warehouse"" category remains the highest performing category relative to its pre-pandemic levels at 302% of the average volume seen in February 2020. This is a 153% increase since the beginning of the year (8 January 2021) and substantially higher the number of adverts seen in the equivalent weeks of 2019 and 2020 for this category. The number of online job adverts for ""catering and hospitality"" and ""wholesale and retail"" also remain substantially higher than that seen in the equivalent weeks of 2019 and 2020.

On 16 July 2021, the volume of online job adverts had increased across all UK countries and English regions when compared with the previous week (9 July 2021), except for the East Midlands where they were broadly unchanged and Northern Ireland where they fell by 7% following recent notable increases. The largest weekly increases were in Wales and the South East where the number of online job adverts had risen slightly by 2%.
In the latest week, the volume of online job adverts remained above their February 2020 average levels in all UK countries and English regions. The highest of these were the North East, Northern Ireland, and the East Midlands, at 175%, 159% and 158% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively.
Meanwhile, relative to its February 2020 average level, the volume of online job adverts remained lowest in London, where the corresponding figure was 112% on 16 July 2021. London has been the region with the lowest volume of online job adverts relative to its February 2020 average level for the highest number of weeks since the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (50 weeks since 31 July 2020). Despite this, its volume does exceed pre-pandemic levels.
According to Department for Transport (DfT) non-seasonally adjusted road traffic data, the volume of all motor vehicle traffic on Monday 19 July 2021 was at 99% of the level seen on the Monday of the first week of February 2020. This is an increase of 5 percentage points from the previous week (Monday 12 July 2021), and follows a notable fall in the previous week, which coincided with heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding for some areas of London. When compared with two weeks ago, traffic levels have remained broadly unchanged.
On Monday 19 July 2021, traffic for light commercial vehicles had increased by 7 percentage points from the previous week (Monday 12 July 2021) to 109% of its level in the first week of February 2020. For both heavy goods vehicles and cars, the corresponding figures were 107% and 95%, respectively, having both increased by 4 percentage points over the same week.

The daily DfT estimates are indexed to the first week of February 2020 and the comparison is with the same day of the week. The data provided are useful as an indication of traffic change rather than actual traffic volumes. More information on the methods, quality and economic analysis for these indicators can be found in the DfT methodology article.
National footfall figures are supplied by Springboard, a provider of data on customer activity. They measure the following for overall UK retail footfall, as well as by high street, retail park, and shopping centre categories:
daily retail footfall as a percentage of its level on the same day of the equivalent week of 2019; for example, Saturday 17 July 2021 is compared with Saturday 13 July 2019
total weekly retail footfall as a percentage of its level in the equivalent week of 2019
the percentage change in weekly footfall compared with the previous week; for example, Week 28 of 2021 is compared with Week 27 of 2021
Springboard's weekly data are defined over a seven-day period running from Sunday to Saturday; Week 28 of 2021 therefore refers to the period Sunday 11 July 2021 to Saturday 17 July 2021

Notes:

The vertical lines indicate notable events. In order, the events are: first national lockdowns begin; restrictions begin to ease across the UK; circuit-breaker lockdown in England; circuit breaker replaced with regional restrictions; Christmas; lockdown begins in England; ""stay at home"" rule ends in England; Easter; reopening of non-essential retail in England and Wales; reopening of non-essential retail in Scotland; reopening of non-essential retail in Northern Ireland.
Users should note that week-on-week changes in retail footfall volumes are outlined as percentages, rather than as percentage point changes. Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the chart.

According to Springboard, in the week to 17 July 2021, the volume of overall retail footfall in the UK remained broadly unchanged from the previous week (week to 10 July 2021). High streets saw a 3% week-on-week increase in footfall; the first weekly increase since the week ending 5 June 2021. This was in part driven by a 10% increase in footfall on Sunday 11 June 2021, when compared with the previous Sunday (4 June 2021). Conversely, footfall at retail parks and shopping centres decreased by 1% and 2%, respectively, when compared with the previous week.
In the same week, overall retail footfall was at 75% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. Comparing retail locations, footfall at retail parks remained the strongest, relative to pre-pandemic levels, at 95% of its equivalent 2019 level, whereas the corresponding figures for high streets and shopping centres were 70% and 68%, respectively. Footfall at retail parks has been strongest when compared with other retail locations, relative to their 2019 levels, throughout the majority of the coronavirus pandemic.


Figure 8: In the week to 17 July 2021, the regions with the highest retail footfall relative to pre-pandemic levels were Northern Ireland, South West England and the West Midlands at 79% of the level in the same week of 2019

Notes:

Footfall data in Northern Ireland for 9 July 2021 were compared with 12 July 2019, which was a bank holiday. This resulted in quality concerns, meaning that the volume for this date has been calculated through linear interpolation.

According to Springboard, in the week to 17 July 2021, retail footfall saw week-on-week percentage increases in six of the ten UK countries and English regions. The largest weekly percentage increase in retail footfall was in Scotland, where it rose by 5%. This rise was largely driven by a 10% increase in high street footfall during the same week, reversing the notable fall that had occurred in the previous week. Northern Ireland recorded the largest weekly fall in retail footfall of 7%, which was in-part driven by a week-on-week fall of 13% in footfall at shopping centres.
In the same week, relative to levels seen in the equivalent week of 2019, retail footfall was strongest in Northern Ireland, the South West of England and the West Midlands when compared with other regions at 79%. In contrast, retail footfall was weakest in the East Midlands at 73% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019.

According to OpenTable, in the week to 19 July 2021, the seven-day average estimate of UK seated diners fell very slightly by 1 percentage point when compared with the previous week to 116% of its level in the equivalent week of 2019. In London, during the same week, the seven-day average estimate of seated diners remained unchanged from the week before at 69% when compared with the equivalent week of 2019. The equivalent figure for Manchester was 102%, having fallen by 2 percentage points from the previous week.
This is the fourth consecutive week that average estimates of seated diners for the UK and Manchester have fallen, having peaked in the week of the spring bank holiday (week to 31 May 2021) when their respective levels were at 173% and 232% of the equivalent week in 2019, shortly after customers were permitted to dine indoors in England again.
This section includes some provisional results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) covering the period 14 to 18 July 2021. The survey went out to 5,832 adults in Great Britain and had a response rate of 66%. Further information to help understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households, and communities in Great Britain will be available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain, due to be published on 23 July 2021.
In the period 14 to 18 July 2021, the proportion of working adults in Great Britain who in the past seven days:
travelled to work (either exclusively or in combination with working from home) increased slightly by 4 percentage points to 64%
worked exclusively from home decreased slightly by 2 percentage points from the previous week to 21%
neither travelled to work, nor worked from home decreased slightly by 2 percentage points from the previous week to 15%
Of the 95% of adults who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for food and medicine was broadly similar to the previous week at 84%.
The proportion of these adults who shopped for things other than food and medicine in the last seven days was broadly similar to the previous week at 41%.

Please note, as part of our regular and ongoing quality assessment of our methods we have introduced improved methods to the weighting of smaller businesses within the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) sample where we use employment and turnover to do so. In the main, previous findings remain unaffected, there are, however, revisions to estimates for certain variables, including turnover, business resilience and proportion on full or partial furlough.
The headline weighting method of qualitative questions, previously weighted by turnover or employment, has been updated to be weighted by count (including turnover and business resilience). This is to better reflect the smaller businesses in the results. Variables that were previously weighted by either employment or turnover will continue to be available in the accompanying dataset, weighted by count as well as employment or turnover.
The data presented here are final results from Wave 37 of BICS, which was live for the period 9 August to 22 August 2021.
For questions regarding the last two weeks, businesses were asked for their experience for the reference period 26 July to 8 August 2021.
These dates should be kept in mind in relation to the easing of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. Dependent on the location and date when the business responded, the easing of restrictions could have had an impact on the estimates.
The reference period overlaps the date when a large-scale relaxation of restrictions in Wales was introduced on 7 August 2021. However, a variety of restrictions remain in place for other nations.
For experimental single-site weighted regional estimates up to Wave 34 (28 June to 11 July 2021), please see Understanding the business impacts of local and national restrictions, UK: July 2021.

Headline figures for turnover and business resilience have been updated to reflect data weighted by count (historically by turnover). Our main findings have not been affected; however, the data have been revised to better reflect the smaller businesses in the results.
The percentage of businesses currently trading was 90% in mid-August 2021. This figure has remained stable since late June 2021, following an increase from 71% in January 2021.
Businesses currently trading were asked how their turnover compared with normal expectations for this time of year. The survey found:
the percentage of businesses reporting a decrease in turnover was 30%
the percentage of businesses reporting an increase in turnover was 9%
the percentage of businesses reporting no effect to turnover was 49%
The percentage of businesses that reported less than three months cash reserves is 37%, which is higher than the previously published value in late July 2021 (formerly weighted by turnover). Due to the updated weighting method, smaller businesses (businesses with 0 to 9 employees) are reflected more in the results, which are more likely to have less cash reserves than larger businesses.
The proportion of businesses' workforce reported to be on full or partial furlough leave (the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)) remains stable at 7% in early August 2021 (representing a provisional approximate range of between 6% to 8% of businesses' workforce), the same as in late July 2021. This is the joint lowest proportion of businesses' workforce reported to be on furlough leave since the furlough scheme began. 
The revision of the BICS weighting methodology has resulted in BICS not permanently stopped trading business furlough estimates being slightly higher than CJRS figures, when previously they were slightly lower.
The survey reference period covers 1 August 2021, at which point the furlough scheme changed, with government contributions reducing from 70% in July 2021 (and 80% prior to that), to cover up to 60% of an employee's earnings. The furlough scheme is set to end on 30 September 2021.
The estimated 7% of businesses' workforce reported to be on full or partial furlough leave in early August 2021 suggests that approximately 1.6 to 2 million people were furloughed within the industries surveyed in BICS.
The BICS number is based on multiplying the BICS weighted furlough proportions by the number of eligible employments1 published in the HMRC CJRS official statistics, for only those industries covered by the BICS sample (exclusions from BICS are agriculture, public administration and defence, public provision of education and health and finance and insurance). Therefore, the BICS estimate is not fully representative of the true number of employees on furlough.
Figure 2 shows the relationship between the revised BICS early estimates of not permanently ceased trading, currently trading and temporarily closed or paused trading businesses in comparison to the HMRC's CJRS official statistics, up to 30 June 2021.

Final unweighted results, Wave 2 to Wave 6, and final weighted results, Wave 7 to Wave 37, of the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS’) Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS); businesses not permanently ceased trading.
Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) official statistic's estimates for June 2021 are provisional and subject to revision. Finalised May 2021 statistics and provisional statistics for June 2021 were published on 29 July 2021.
Only industries included in the BICS samples are included in the “CJRS Statistics: BICS Industries only” series, but all industries are included in “CJRS Statistics: All industries” series.
An “employment” in the HMRC CJRS Official Statistics is defined as anyone who meets the scheme criteria set out within the published guidance, and data comes from the whole population of HMRC CJRS claims (those applied) and PAYE Real Time Information systems (RTIs).
The CJRS official statistic's proportion furloughed is an average of the number of employments furloughed over the two-week BICS reference period, divided by the total eligible employments.
The dates used in the plot are for the middle of each BICS Wave.

For current point estimates, and looking forward as coronavirus regulations are relaxed, it is recommended to use the ""not permanently stopped trading"" business estimates, as the number of responding businesses in industries highly affected by heightened coronavirus restrictions has increased with relaxation of restrictions. 
It is recommended to use the BICS ‘currently trading series’ when reviewing as a time series or looking backwards when there were heightened coronavirus restrictions on businesses. However, please note that the BICS ‘currently trading series’ represents a lower range for the percentage of the workforce on furlough leave, as the estimate does not contain paused trading businesses, which typically had a higher proportion of their workforce on furlough. 
We make these recommendations, as getting a response from paused traders, which increased during certain periods of the pandemic, was more difficult, particularly as business behaviours were adapting quickly during periods of changing restrictions making estimation more difficult. There is therefore more volatility and uncertainty for these traders. As a result, the ‘BICS currently trading series’ should be used as a historic comparator, but this would represent a lower range for the percentage of furlough given that this does not include paused traders. 
An updated overview of the differences between the fortnightly BICS furlough estimates and HMRC's CJRS figures, will be published 2 September 2021
On 1 July 2020, the option to partially furlough employees was introduced for employers. With this option employers can furlough their employees for part of their usual hours, with the employee free to work the remainder. This was in addition to the fully furloughed option.
Among the workforce reported to be on full or partial furlough leave in early August 2021, 39% were reported to be fully furloughed. This has steadily declined from 69% in mid-January 2021 and is the lowest proportion of furloughed employees reported to be fully furloughed since the question was introduced in October 2020.
The transportation and storage industry had the lowest percentage of businesses currently trading in mid-August 2021, at 82%. The high percentage of paused and not permanently ceased traders is partly driven by the freight transport by road industry and the unlicensed carriers industry. It has been reported that this industry has been experiencing a shortage of lorry drivers.
The administrative and support service activities industry, the information and communication industry, the professional, scientific and technical activities industry and the real estate industry all had the second lowest proportion of businesses currently trading, at 86% in mid-August 2021. This has remained broadly unchanged since early August 2021.
It should be noted that the definition of currently trading used within the BICS refers to the business currently trading in any capacity. It does not cover whether a business has completely reopened to trading at full capacity, as experienced before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic or if the business is operating at a reduced level of capacity but is still trading.
In the education (private sector and higher education businesses only) industry, 54% of businesses reported experiencing a decrease in turnover in the last two weeks compared with normal levels for this time of year, in early August 2021. This has increased from 31% in early April 2021. The high percentage is partly driven by the other education not elsewhere classified (NEC) industry, which includes, but not limited to, education that is not definable by level and/or computer training.
One industry particularly affected by the coronavirus pandemic was the accommodation and food service activities industry. However in late July, 18% reported turnover had increased compared with normal expectations for this time of year.
Almost one-quarter (24%) of the workforce in the other service activities industry were reported to on partial or full furlough leave. Within this industry, the highest proportions of the workforce reported to be on furlough leave is in the hairdressing and other beauty treatment industry.
In early August 2021, businesses reported 1% of their workforce on sick leave or not working due to coronavirus (COVID-19), self-isolation or quarantine and has remained stable since comparable estimates began in June 2020.
Of currently trading businesses, 11% had exported and 12% imported in the last 12 months, and reported how their exporting or importing compared with normal expectations for this time of year. These businesses were asked about the challenges they had experienced with exporting or importing in the last two weeks.
Download the data
The proportion of currently trading businesses that experienced a challenge in importing decreased from 63% in late July 2021 to 57% in early August 2021, after remaining stable following a sharp increase in January 2021. The proportion of currently trading businesses that experienced a challenge in exporting has remained broadly stable since January 2021, following a similar increase from December 2020. The data suggests businesses are more likely to be experiencing an importing challenge than an exporting one.
Additional paperwork and transportation costs were reported as the top challenges for exporting and importing, respectively. The proportion of currently trading businesses experiencing these challenges has remained broadly stable since early May 2021 for exporting and importing.
For importing, the proportion of businesses that reported that transportation costs were a challenge saw a decrease from 47% in early July 2021 to 42% in early August 2021.
Businesses that are currently trading were also asked what they were exporting or importing in the last 12 months. These businesses said that:
55% exported and 81% imported goods only
34% exported and 10% imported services only
10% exported and 9% imported both goods and services
1% was not sure for exporting and less than 1% was not sure for importing
Further industry, size band and breakdowns of trade questions by what they are exporting or importing (goods, services or both) are available in the accompanying dataset.
Almost half of businesses not permanently stopped trading reported their debt repayments have increased compared with normal expectations over the last month. Of all businesses:
16% reported an increase of more than 50%
7% reported an increase of between 20% and 50%
23% reported an increase of up to 20%
43% reported repayments had stayed the same
3% reported repayments decreased
8% reported they were not sure how their repayments compared with normal expectations
Businesses were also asked, how much confidence they had that they will meet their debt obligations.
Businesses were asked, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), has the business reduced the terms and conditions of any of their workforce.
Across all industries:
3% responded yes
58% responded no
6% responded not sure
29% responded not applicable
4% responded prefer not to say
The other service activities industry and the education (private sector and higher education businesses only) industry reported the highest percentage of businesses who responded ""yes"", at 14% and 11% respectively. The high percentage is partly driven by the hairdressing and other beauty treatment industry and the other education not classified elsewhere (NEC) industry, respectively.
Of those businesses who responded ""yes"" within the education (private sector and higher education businesses only) industry, 79% of businesses reported this applied to ""above 75% of the workforce"".
Businesses not permanently ceased trading were asked if they were able to get the materials, goods or services they needed from within the UK in the last two weeks.
Across all industries, 7% reported they were not able to get the materials, goods or services needed from within the UK in the last two weeks, this has remained unchanged from early July 2021. The construction industry reported the largest percentage at 15%, followed by the wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles industry at 11%.
Across all industries, 9% reported they were able to get the materials, goods or services they needed from within the UK in the last two weeks, but had to change suppliers or find alternative solutions to do so, this is up from 8% in early July 2021. Over 17% of businesses in the manufacturing and construction industries reported this, followed by 13% and 11% in wholesale and retail trade industry and accommodation and food service activities industry, respectively.
Businesses not permanently stopped trading were also asked how their stock levels for the last two weeks compared with normal expectations for this time of year.
Of businesses not permanently stopped trading, 4% reported that stock levels were higher than normal, while 13% reported that stock levels were lower than normal. Almost one in four businesses (23%) reported that stock levels had not changed. This has remained stable since late December 2021.
The accommodation and food service activities industry reported the largest percentage of businesses that indicated stock levels were lower (27%), followed by the wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles industry (25%) and the manufacturing industry (23%).
In recent media, there were reports of some businesses within the accommodation and food service activities industry experiencing supply shortages.
For further information and data on the preparedness of businesses surrounding the continuation of supply chains and stock levels, see the accompanying dataset.
Of businesses not permanently stopped trading, 18% intend to use increased homeworking as a permanent business model going forward, while 19% are not sure. This has remained broadly unchanged from late July 2021.
The information and communication industry and the professional, scientific and technical activities industry had the highest percentages of businesses intending to use increased homeworking as a permanent business model going forwards, at 45% and 33% respectively in mid-August 2021.
In Wave 37, the response option ""reduced carbon emissions"" was introduced and 38% of businesses reported this was one reason for intending to implement increased homeworking.
Data on full industry breakdowns, including why a business does not intend to use increased homeworking as a permanent business model going forward is available in the accompanying dataset.

Results presented in this bulletin are experimental and may be subject to revision. 



In collaboration with Companies House, from 16 September 2021 we are introducing a weekly indicator of the number of company compulsory dissolution first gazettes issued in the UK. Compulsory dissolution first gazette statistics are a complementary indicator of potential company closure to voluntary dissolution applications and help provide a fuller picture of business demography in the UK. 
Companies House paused the issuing of compulsory dissolution first gazettes between 16 March and 10 October 2020, and between 21 January and 8 March 2021. The deadline for companies to supply them with statutory documents for all filing deadlines falling between 27 June 2020 and 5 April 2021 was also extended. To ensure comparability we will present weekly compulsory dissolution first gazette figures as annual cumulative counts in the real-time indicators bulletin. Users should bear this in mind when comparing cumulative company dissolution figures between years.
More information on compulsory dissolution first gazettes, voluntary dissolution applications and incorporations can be found in the Companies House methodology document.

There were 20,503 compulsory dissolution first gazettes issued in the UK in the week to 7 September 2021, bringing the cumulative total since the start of the year to 343,787. This cumulative annual figure is 30% and 26% higher than the pre-pandemic years of 2018 and 2019, respectively. The recent increases have likely been caused by the ending of legislative easements, whereby companies were granted extensions to filing deadlines.
The weekly and cumulative data are available in the accompanying dataset, along with data on voluntary dissolutions (another type of company closure) and company incorporations.

In the latest week, the seven-day average estimate of seated diners in Manchester was 128% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. During the same period, the equivalent figure for London was 81%. 
Last year’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme provided 50% off the cost of food and/or non-alcoholic drinks eaten-in at participating businesses UK-wide. It aimed to help protect jobs in the hospitality sector by encouraging consumers to eat out. The scheme applied all-day Monday to Wednesday from 3 to 31 August 2020.

Data show the percentage of seated diners when compared with the same day in 2019. For example, Saturday 3 August 2019 is compared with Saturday 1 August 2020 and Saturday 30 July 2021.
The 31 August 2021 was a bank holiday and as such this data point should be viewed with caution.

The average daily estimate of UK seated diners for the month of August 2020 (when the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was in place) was 122% of the equivalent period of 2019. This is 69 percentage points higher than the proceeding 28 days (4 to 31 July 2020), the period from which pubs and restaurants in England were able to reopen. This shows a marked uptick in UK seated diners during the period the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was in place, when compared with the proceeding period with restrictions relaxed. 
The average daily estimate of UK seated diners for August 2020 (122%) was 16 percentage points lower than the corresponding period in 2021 (137%). Meanwhile, the August 2020 average daily estimate of seated diners in London was 61% of the equivalent period of 2019; 24 percentage points lower than the same period in 2021 (85%).
The lower number of seated diners across the whole of August 2020, when compared with 2021, is not surprising given increased restrictions, the level of uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the subsequent vaccination rollout in 2021. 
As the scheme applied all-day Monday to Wednesday throughout August 2020 it is useful to compare these days in isolation across 2021 and 2020. The average daily estimate of UK seated diners from Monday to Wednesday in August 2020 was 165% of the equivalent dates of 2019. This was 31 percentage points higher than the corresponding figure for August 2021 (134%) and indicates a notable impact on seated diners for the days that the scheme applied.
In London meanwhile, when we compare seated diner estimates on Monday to Wednesday in August in 2021 and 2020, the impact of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme is much less obvious. The average daily estimate of London seated diners for Monday to Wednesday in 2021 was 77% of its level in the equivalent period of 2019, while the corresponding figure for August 2020 was only 1 percentage point higher at 78%.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis from October 2020, Prices Economic Analysis Quarterly, noted that there was an indication of a displacement effect during the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, whereby diners shifted their dining habits slightly towards the beginning of the week, to the days that the scheme applied to. This is reflected in the analysis with a marked increase in UK seated diner estimates on the days that the scheme applied, when comparing 2020 with 2021. However, when contrasting August 2020 to the equivalent period in 2021, estimates for UK seated diners for 2021 were notably higher. 
Users should note that comparison to seated diner estimates for Manchester does not feature in this section as the Manchester data is only available from November 2020.

These data are daily flight figures from the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL). Daily flight numbers for the UK alongside other countries are available in EUROCONTROL's dashboard. EUROCONTROL is a pan-European, civil-military organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation. Its Aviation Intelligence and Performance Review Unit provides independent collection and validation of air navigation services performance-related data and intelligence gathering.
The flights data include international arrivals and departures to and from the UK (including crown dependencies) and domestic UK flights, but exclude overflights (flights that pass over UK territory). They capture all flight movements that operate under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), where the pilot uses instruments in the flight deck to control, guide and adjust the plane. This includes commercial flights carrying passengers and cargo as well as non-commercial flights such as private and military flights.
Data from EUROCONTROL do not include information on the volume of passengers or cargo carried on UK flights. Especially in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, flights might not be operating at full capacity and therefore trends in passengers and cargo will differ from trends in flights presented here.

In the week ending 12 September 2021, the seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,579, broadly unchanged from the previous week (3,589). The average number of UK daily flights in the latest week was at 54% and 128% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019 and 2020, respectively.
The seven-day average number of UK daily flights has increased by 151% from the week ending 23 May 2021, the week that international travel was allowed to resume and the UK government implemented the travel traffic light system (17 May 2021).
The full data time series available for UK flights can be found in the accompanying dataset, which contains daily flight numbers and the rolling seven-day averages.
Initial results from Wave 39 of the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) cover the reference period 23 August to 5 September 2021, with a response rate of 19.6% (7,525 responses). The survey was live for the period 6 to 14 September 2021.
These figures are experimental estimates of online job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, by category, by UK country and English region. The number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour. The Adzuna categories used do not correspond to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Vacancy Survey.
According to Adzuna, on 10 September 2021, the total volume of online job adverts in the UK was unchanged from the previous week (3 September 2021).
Of the 28 categories, 17 saw a weekly increase in the number of online job adverts, 3 were unchanged, while the remaining 8 decreased when compared with the previous week. The largest weekly increase was in “education”, which rose by 10% and follows six consecutive weeks of decline. This was the largest weekly increase in this category since 12 March 2021, although the “education” category remains below its pre-pandemic February 2020 average level. The largest weekly fall was in “part-time/weekend”, which fell by 12%, and follows two weeks where this category saw a 17% weekly decline followed by growth of 18%.
The total volume of online job adverts remained substantially above pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic volume, at 128% of its February 2020 average level. The “transport, logistics and warehouse” category remained that with the highest amount of job adverts relative to its February 2020 average pre-pandemic level, at 325%.
There were five categories which were below their pre-pandemic levels, the lowest of which were ""education”, “graduate” and “travel/tourism”, all at 92% of their February 2020 average level.
On 10 September 2021, the volume of online job adverts increased in 5 of the 12 UK countries and English regions when compared with the previous week (3 September 2021), the largest of which was Northern Ireland where it increased by 5%. The volume of online job adverts was unchanged in 4 and fell in 3 UK countries and English regions, the largest of which was Wales where it fell by 2%. 
In the latest week, volumes of online job adverts remained above their February 2020 average levels in all UK countries and English regions. The highest of these were in Northern Ireland, the North East and the East Midlands, at 174%, 172% and 154% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively. This is the first week since 9 April 2021 where the North East does not have the highest number of job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic level. 
In London, the volume of online job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic (February 2020) average level has increased by 12 percentage points in the last two weeks, although it remains the region with the lowest volume of adverts compared with its pre-pandemic level.
These data series are experimental faster indicators for estimating UK spending on credit and debit cards. They track the daily CHAPS payments made by credit and debit card payment processors to around 100 major UK retail corporates. These payments are the proceeds of recent credit and debit card transactions made by customers at their stores, both via physical and via online platforms. More information on the indicator is provided in the accompanying methodology article.  
Companies are allocated to one of four categories based on their primary business: 
""staples"" refers to companies that sell essential goods that households need to purchase, such as food and utilities 
""work-related"" refers to companies providing public transport or selling petrol  
""delayable"" refers to companies selling goods whose purchase could be delayed, such as clothing or furnishings
""social"" refers to spending on travel and eating out  
Figure 8 shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors, ""merchant acquirers"".  
In the week to 9 September 2021, the CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases in aggregate decreased by 5 percentage points from the previous week to 95% of its February 2020 average level. All spending categories decreased in this latest week: 
“delayable” decreased by 7 percentage points
“staple” decreased by 5 percentage points
“work-related” decreased by 1 percentage point
“social” decreased by 1 percentage point
This week to 9 September 2021 compares with the week to 2 September 2021 which contained the August pay day and the Summer Bank Holiday. Users should note this when comparing aggregate spending and spending by category. 
Since 17 May 2021, when the hospitality industry was allowed to serve customers indoors in England, spending on “social” has increased by 9 percentage points. Over the same period spending on “staples” has decreased by 8 percentage points. 
In the latest week (week to 9 September 2021), only “work-related” and “staple” spending were above their February 2020 average level, at 117% and 102%, respectively. Conversely, “delayable” and “social” spending were at 86% and 91% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively. 
National footfall figures are supplied by Springboard, a provider of data on customer activity. They measure the following for overall UK retail footfall, as well as by high street, retail park, and shopping centre categories:
daily retail footfall as a percentage of its level on the same day of the equivalent week of 2019; for example, Saturday 11 September 2021 is compared with Saturday 7 September 2019
total weekly retail footfall as a percentage of its level in the equivalent week of 2019
the percentage change in weekly footfall compared with the previous week; for example, Week 36 of 2021 is compared with Week 35 of 2021
Springboard's weekly data are defined over a seven-day period running from Sunday to Saturday; Week 36 of 2021 therefore refers to the period Sunday 5 September to Saturday 11 September 2021
Users should note that all quoted figures have been rounded to the nearest integer.

Notes:

The vertical lines indicate notable events. In order, the events are: first national lockdowns begin; restrictions begin to ease across the UK; circuit-breaker lockdown in England; circuit breaker replaced with regional restrictions; Christmas; lockdown begins in England; ""stay at home"" rule ends in England; Easter; reopening of non-essential retail in England and Wales; reopening of non-essential retail in Scotland; reopening of non-essential retail in Northern Ireland; most legal restrictions to control coronavirus (COVID-19) lifted in England.
Users should note that week-on-week changes in retail footfall volumes are outlined as percentages, rather than as percentage point changes. Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the chart.

According to Springboard, in the week to 11 September 2021, the volume of overall retail footfall in the UK decreased by 4% from the previous week (week to 4 September 2021), because of an 8% fall in shopping centre footfall, as well as falls in retail park and high street footfall of 5% and 2% respectively. 
In the latest week to 11 September 2021, overall retail footfall was at 83% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. Comparing retail locations, footfall at retail parks remained the strongest relative to pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels, at 96% of its equivalent 2019 level. Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for high streets and shopping centres were 80% and 76%, respectively. Throughout most of the pandemic, footfall at retail parks has consistently been strongest when compared with other retail locations, relative to their 2019 levels.

According to Springboard, in the week to 11 September 2021, retail footfall saw week-on-week percentage decreases in all 10 UK countries and English regions, the largest of which was in Wales, where footfall fell by 9% over the week, with the North and Yorkshire seeing the smallest fall of 2%.
In the same week, relative to the levels seen in the equivalent week of 2019, retail footfall was strongest in the South West at 88%. In contrast, retail footfall was weakest in Scotland and Northern Ireland, at 77% and 78% respectively of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. 
A changeover in the systems used to collect these data has introduced a level shift in the data time series from 14 June 2021 onwards, and users should not make comparisons between data before and after this date. The data produced prior to the change, for 1 April 2019 to 13 June 2021, can still be compared within that period.
A full methodological review of our current method of data collection is underway and data may be subject to revision once this is complete. We will continue to update the accompanying dataset using the current method until the review is complete.

According to Department for Transport (DfT) non-seasonally adjusted road traffic data, the volume of all motor vehicle traffic on Monday 13 September 2021 was at the same level seen on the Monday of the first week in February 2020.
Compared with the previous week (Monday 6 September 2021), traffic volume was unchanged for heavy goods and car vehicle traffic, at 109% and 96% of their level in the first week of February 2020, respectively. In comparison, the equivalent figure for light vehicle traffic was 112%, a 2 percentage point increase from the previous week. 
Further data on traffic volumes as well as data on other modes of transport such as rail and tube are available from DfT.
The daily DfT estimates are indexed to the first week of February 2020 and the comparison is with the same day of the week. The data provided are useful as an indication of traffic change rather than actual traffic volumes. More information on the methods, quality and economic analysis for these indicators can be found in the DfT methodology article.

Three-quarters (75%) of businesses currently trading and who had imported in the last 12 months experienced a challenge importing in late October to early November 2021; this was up from 60% in late September 2021, a change in reference period for the question may have impacted the responses. Business insights and impact on the UK economy: 18 November 2021.
Of the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so and reported wearing a face covering increased slightly by 2 percentage points from the previous period to 85% (Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, 3 to 14 November 2021). Section 12.
There were 15,290 company incorporations in the week to 12 November 2021, an increase of 4% from the previous week and an increase of 28% from the equivalent week of 2019 (11,992) (Companies House). See the accompanying dataset.

Shelf availability research for shops across the UK has been undertaken by Kantar Public. Collectors gathered information on a range of items from up to three different stores across multiple locations, recording availability across four categories: ""none"", ""low"", ""medium"", or ""high"". It is important to note these categories are subjective as they are recorded by individual collectors. The data were collected between 12 and 15 November 2021. This new series will be updated weekly.


Figure 1: Shelf availability of items between 12 and 15 November 2021 was lowest for “crisps (multipack)”, with 29% of this item’s availability marked as “none” or “low”
Item availability in stores across 126 locations covering UK countries and English regions, between 12 and 15 November 2021

Notes:

Shelf availability does not imply stock availability in warehouses or storage units and is simply the level of available products in a selected sample of shops at the time of data collection.
Total count of shops visited were 270 and total observations made were 5,746.
Categories in this chart have been rounded for illustrative purposes and may not sum to category total or 100.
Crisps (multipack) has been added this week to the basket of goods being monitored.

In the current period (12 to 15 November 2021), the overall proportion of observations for all items recorded as ""high"" was 54%; this was broadly similar to the previous four-day period (5 to 8 November 2021). Observations for all items recorded at ""none"" or ""low"" was 10%, also remaining broadly similar compared with the previous period.
Across the four availability categories, the largest proportion of observations recorded as ""high"" was ""beer"" at 71%, followed by ""chocolate selection boxes"" at 67%. The highest proportion of items with availability recorded as either ""none"" or ""low"" was ""crisps (multipack)"" at 29%, followed by ""paracetamol"" at 17%.
Data for all categories are available in the accompanying dataset.
These data are daily flight figures from the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL). Daily flight numbers for the UK alongside other countries are available in EUROCONTROL's dashboard. EUROCONTROL is a pan-European, civil-military organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation. Its Aviation Intelligence and Performance Review Unit provides independent collection and validation of air navigation services performance-related data and intelligence gathering.
The flights data include international arrivals and departures to and from the UK (including crown dependencies) and domestic UK flights, but exclude overflights (flights that pass over UK territory). They capture all flight movements that operate under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), where the pilot uses instruments in the flight deck to control, guide and adjust the plane. This includes commercial flights carrying passengers and cargo as well as non-commercial flights such as private and military flights.
Data from EUROCONTROL do not include information on the volume of passengers or cargo carried on UK flights. Especially in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, flights might not be operating at full capacity and therefore trends in passengers and cargo will differ from trends in flights presented here.


Figure 2: The latest seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,284; this is 190% of the level in the equivalent week of 2020 and the highest relative to 2020 since the week ending 4 July 2021

From 1 March 2020 to 1 May 2020, the average daily flights compared with the level seen on the equivalent day of 2019 of Spain, the UK, France, and Germany fell by 95, 90, 89 and 82 percentage points, respectively. Since November 2020, compared with Germany, Spain and France, the UK has continually had the lowest average daily flights relative to the level seen on the equivalent day of 2019 (currently 64%).
EUROCONTROL publishes flights data for a range of different European countries, these three countries were chosen for this analysis as they record the four largest air traffic volumes, including the UK. You can find the full data time series available for UK flights in the accompanying dataset, which contains daily flight numbers and the rolling seven-day averages.
System average price (SAP) of gas data are available in the Data Item Explorer from the National Grid.
The system average price (SAP) is the average price of all gas traded through the balancing market. Market participants post bids or offers for volumes of gas as day-ahead and within-day trades. The SAP aggregates the trades conducted on the On-the-Day Commodity Market (OCM). This is the market that the National Grid uses in its role as residual balancer. Other markets exist for wholesale gas trading in Great Britain.
These data can be used to understand the general trend of gas prices within Great Britain. However, they should be treated with caution as these can be subject to extreme within-day trading prices and may skew actual traded prices. It must also be noted that while these prices reflect spot prices on the day, traders can opt for futures contracts where the buyer and the seller agree the market-determined price for gas for a future date. The daily SAP is used to determine the futures price and is therefore a useful indicator of supply constraints and demand pressures. 
These data and the accompanying dataset are updated weekly in this bulletin.

Notes:

The price trends observed in the chart will differ from that of the monthly producer price inflation (PPI) series published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) because of the differences in data sources and methods.
The seven-day rolling average has been distorted because of the latest large fall in System average price (SAP), actual-day values.

Since the start of 2021, the seven-day rolling average SAP has been steadily increasing. The price has more than tripled, with an increase of 302% since 1 January 2021. Despite this week's 4% week-on-week increase the seven-day rolling average SAP was 23% lower than five weeks ago (week ending 10 October 2021).
The full data time series of actual-day SAP and the preceding seven-day average, encompassing data from 2018 to the present, can be found in the accompanying dataset.
These figures are experimental estimates of online job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, by category, by UK country and English region. The number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour. The Adzuna categories used do not correspond to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Vacancy Survey.
Download the data
Of the 28 categories, 21 saw a decrease in the number of online job adverts, while four increased and three were unchanged when compared with the previous week. The largest week-on-week increase was in “facilities and maintenance”, which rose by 5%. The largest week-on-week decreases were in “legal”, “transport, logistics and warehouse” and “HR and recruitment”, which fell by 10%, 7% and 7%, respectively. Of the 28 categories, only “legal” and “energy, oil and gas” are below their February 2020 average level.
Download the data
The volume of online job adverts decreased for 11 of 12 UK countries and English regions on 12 November 2021 and follows widespread increases in the previous week. Northern Ireland showed the only week-on-week increase although this is because of high volatility caused by a lower or fluctuating sample size. The largest week-on-week decreases were in the North East, East of England and Scotland, which fell by 7%, 4% and 4%, respectively. The volumes of online job adverts in all 12 UK countries and English regions were above their February 2020 levels.
These data series are experimental faster indicators for estimating UK spending on credit and debit cards. They track the daily CHAPS payments made by credit and debit card payment processors to around 100 major UK retail corporates. These payments are the proceeds of recent credit and debit card transactions made by customers at their stores, both through physical and online platforms. More information on the indicator is provided in the accompanying methodology article.   
Companies are allocated to one of four categories based on their primary business:    
""staples"" refers to companies that sell essential goods that households need to purchase, such as food and utilities   
""work-related"" refers to companies providing public transport or selling petrol   
""delayable"" refers to companies selling goods whose purchase could be delayed, such as clothing or furnishings
""social"" refers to spending on travel and eating out
Figure 7 shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors, ""merchant acquirers"".  
In the week to 11 November 2021, the CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases in aggregate decreased by 4 percentage points from the previous week, to 101% of its February 2020 average level. All spending categories, excluding ""work-related"" decreased in this latest week:
""staple"" decreased by 8 percentage points
""social"" decreased by 3 percentage points
""delayable"" decreased by 2 percentage points
""work-related"" increased by 1 percentage point
In the latest week, ""social"" spending was below its February 2020 average level at  93%, while ""delayable"" spending was at 100% of its February 2020 average level. Conversely, ""staple"" and ""work-related"" spending were above their February 2020 average level at 106% and 119%, respectively.
In October 2021, the monthly CHAPS-based indicator of aggregate credit and debit card spending was at 99% of its February 2020 average level, a 3-percentage point increase from September 2021.
The monthly data time series is available in the accompanying dataset and includes methodological notes that users should bear in mind. The monthly CHAPS index is calculated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), rather than being an additional series that is produced and validated by the Bank of England.
National retail footfall figures are supplied by Springboard, a provider of data on customer activity. They measure the following for overall UK retail footfall, as well as by high street, retail park, and shopping centre categories:
daily retail footfall as a percentage of its level on the same day of the equivalent week of 2019; for example, Saturday 13 November 2021 is compared with Saturday 9 November 2019
total weekly retail footfall as a percentage of its level in the equivalent week of 2019
the percentage change in weekly footfall compared with the previous week; for example, Week 45 of 2021 is compared with Week 44 of 2021
Springboard's weekly data are defined over a seven-day period running from Sunday to Saturday. Week 45 of 2021 therefore refers to the period Sunday 7 November to Saturday 13 November 2021.
Users should note that all quoted figures have been rounded to the nearest integer.

The vertical lines indicate notable events and coronavirus (COVID-19) restriction changes.
Users should note that week-on-week changes in retail footfall volumes are outlined as percentages, rather than as percentage point changes. Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the chart.

According to Springboard, in the week to 13 November 2021, the volume of overall retail footfall in the UK:
for high streets increased by 2% from the previous week and was 83% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019
for retail parks decreased slightly by 1% from the previous week and was 96% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019

In the week to 13 November 2021, retail footfall saw week-on-week increases in 6 of the 10 UK countries and English regions, the largest occurring in the West Midlands, which increased by 8%. This was driven by a 13% and 7% rise in high street and shopping centre footfall, respectively. Retail footfall in Northern Ireland remained unchanged and fell slightly by 1% in Greater London, South West England and East England, when compared with the previous week. 
In the same week, relative to the levels seen in the equivalent week of 2019, retail footfall was strongest in the South East at 90%, followed by the South West at 89%. In contrast, retail footfall was weakest in Scotland and Northern Ireland at 78% and 81%, respectively.
Pret A Manger is a sandwich and coffee shop franchise chain, operating around 400 stores across the UK. Its transactional data are presented as an index and show total weekly till transactions at Pret A Manger shops as a proportion of the average weekly level in the first four weeks of 2020 (between Friday 3 January and Thursday 30 January 2020). Because of this comparison across the data time series, users should expect an element of seasonality in the data.
More information on the areas featured is available in the Measuring the data section. These data are also made available every Tuesday via Bloomberg.

Notes:

Dine-in services in England were suspended during the third national lockdown, which remained in place until Step 3 (17 May 2021) of England’s roadmap out of lockdown.
Users should note not all store locations reopened as coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were eased.
The index begins on 4 March 2021 as most stores were closed before this therefore the corresponding indices were mostly zero.

A changeover in the systems used to collect these data has introduced a level shift in the data time series from 14 June 2021 onwards. Users should not make comparisons between data before and after this date. The data produced prior to the change, for 1 April 2019 to 13 June 2021, can still be compared within that period.
A full methodological review of our current method of data collection is under way and data may be subject to revision once this is complete. We will continue to update the accompanying dataset using the current method until the review is complete.

This section includes some provisional results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) covering the period 3 to 14 November 2021. The survey went out to 4,498 adults in Great Britain and had a response rate of 70% (3,127 responses). Further information to help understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain is available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain.
In the period 3 to 14 November 2021, the proportion of working adults in Great Britain who in the past seven days:
travelled to work (both exclusively and in combination with working from home) decreased slightly by 3 percentage points from the previous period (20 to 31 October 2021) to 67%
worked exclusively from home remained broadly similar to the previous period at 16% (15% last period)
neither travelled to work nor worked from home increased slightly by 2 percentage points from the previous period to 17%
Of the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for food and medicine remained unchanged from the previous period at 85%.
The proportion of these adults who shopped for things other than food and medicine in the past seven days remained broadly similar to the previous period at 47% (46% last period).
Of the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so and reported wearing a face covering increased slightly by 2 percentage points from the previous period to 85%.
Further breakdowns, such as the situation when a face covering was worn (for example, while shopping), and by country, is available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain.

Around 4 in 10 (43%) adults reported they always or often maintained social distancing when outside their home in the past seven days, while over 6 in 10 adults (63%) reported they avoided physical contact with others outside their home in the past seven days; these proportions were higher among older people and those who reported they are clinically extremely vulnerable.
During the Christmas season, over 6 in 10 adults (63%) reported they planned to visit (or had already visited) family or friends in their homes, while around half (51%) planned to have (or had already had) family or friends visit them in their home; around three-quarters (73%) planned to stay (or stayed) at home if feeling unwell to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 (80% in the previous period).

This figure is down from 75% at a similar time last year. However, it has increased from 56% since the last data collection period between 1 and 12 December 2021.
Although people seem less concerned about the impact of the pandemic compared with the start of last year, the proportion of people who do not expect life to return to normal for more than a year has risen from 20% to 35% during the same period.
The proportion of people who reported wearing a face covering remained high at 96%, up from 94% at the previous survey period and close to the 97% recorded a year ago.
Meanwhile, there was a significant increase in the perception of others wearing face coverings. About two in three adults (66%) said they saw everyone or almost everyone wearing face coverings in shops, compared with 47% in the previous period.

The majority of adults (96%) wore a face covering when outside their home in the past seven days, up slightly from 94% in the previous period (1 to 12 December 2021), and similar to one year ago (97% from 22 December 2020 to 3 January 2021); proportions were similar across England (96%), Wales (96%) and Scotland (97%).
Around two-thirds (66%) of adults reported having received two coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines and a booster (compared with 46% in the previous period). 
Around 1 in 10 (9%) adults had been asked to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test in the past seven days (excluding when travelling abroad) (8% in the previous period).
Almost 6 in 10 adults (57%) said they had taken a rapid lateral flow test in the past seven days (42% in the previous period), with higher proportions of younger people taking one compared with older people.
The proportion of adults working from home at some point in the past seven days remained stable in this period (32%) while there was a fall in those reporting travelling to work at some point (60%) (compared with 32% and 72% respectively in the period 1 to 12 December 2021).
Around 4 in 10 (43%) adults reported they always or often maintained social distancing when outside their home in the past seven days, while over 6 in 10 adults (63%) reported they avoided physical contact with others outside their home in the past seven days; these proportions were higher among older people and those who reported they are clinically extremely vulnerable.
During the Christmas season, over 6 in 10 adults (63%) reported they planned to visit (or had already visited) family or friends in their homes, while around half (51%) planned to have (or had already had) family or friends visit them in their home; around three-quarters (73%) planned to stay (or stayed) at home if feeling unwell to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 (80% in the previous period).

Estimates included in this release are based on data collected between 15 December 2021 and 3 January 2022, during which new measures against the Omicron variant were introduced. The latest information and guidance in England, Wales, and Scotland can be found on the gov.uk website. 



Following the emergence of the new Omicron variant across Great Britain, each constituent country has introduced new measures aiming to control the spread and protect the NHS, while also accelerating the coronavirus (COVID-19) booster vaccination programmes.
This release provides the first estimates of the impacts of some of these measures, based on data collected in the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. 
In England, the move to Plan B was confirmed on 8 December 2021. This included:
mandatory use of face coverings in most indoor venues from 10 December
advice to work from home for those who can from 13 December
mandatory use of NHS COVID Passes for proof of two vaccine doses, or proof of a negative lateral flow test, for entry to large events and venues from 15 December
advice to test using a lateral flow device, particularly before entering a high-risk setting or visiting a vulnerable person
In Scotland, similar measures on face coverings, working from home and NHS COVID Passes were already in place, with new measures aimed at reducing social interactions at home and indoor settings recently announced, including:
advice to reduce social contact by meeting in groups of no more than three households from 14 December • large events being limited in capacity with 1-metre physical distancing from 26 December
a limit to three households meeting at indoor and outdoor venues, such as bars and cinemas from 27 December
In Wales, measures on face coverings, working from home and NHS COVID Passes were also similarly in place, with further measures more recently announced, including: 
a move to alert level 2, reintroducing the “rule of six” and limiting the number of people at indoor and outdoor events from 26 December
the closure of nightclubs and 2-metre social distancing in public places and offices from 26 December
Estimates for England, Scotland and Wales, and regions in England can be found in the data tables accompanying this release. 
Throughout this bulletin, we refer to “this period” (15 December 2021 to 3 January 2022) and the “previous period” (1 to 12 December 2021). 
During this period, the majority (96%) of adults across Great Britain wore a face covering when outside their home in the past seven days, up slightly from 94% in the previous period, and similar to one year ago (97% from 22 December 2020 to 3 January 2021). 
The proportions of adults who reported wearing face coverings were similar in England (96%, 94% in the previous period), Wales (96%, 94% in the previous period) and Scotland (97%, 98% in the previous period).
According to age, higher proportions of older adults reported wearing face coverings (97% of those aged 50 to 69 years and 70 years and over) compared with younger people (94% of those aged 16 to 29 years and 96% of those aged 30 to 49 years), though these differences were not statistically significant.
Among adults who left home to shop in the past seven days, 95% reported wearing a face covering often or always, while around two-thirds (66%) reported seeing everyone or almost everyone wearing a face covering when doing so (compared with 88% and 47% respectively in the previous period).
Among adults who travelled on public transport in the past seven days, 9 in 10 (90%) reported wearing a face covering for the whole journey, while around two-thirds (65%) reported seeing everyone or almost everyone wearing a face covering while doing so (compared with 84% and 45% respectively in the previous period).
Among adults who had been inside a restaurant, café, or bar in the past seven days, over one-third (36%) reported often or always wearing a face covering when doing so. At the same time, around 3 in 10 (29%) reported seeing everyone or almost everyone wearing a face covering in these settings (compared with 28% and 19% respectively in the previous period).
Most adults (90%) reported they felt wearing a face covering was important or very important in slowing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) (unchanged from the previous period). This proportion appeared to increase with age; 86% of those aged 16 to 29 years, 88% of those aged 30 to 49 years, 93% of those aged 50 to 69 years, and 96% of those aged 70 years and over reported this.
Usual work and work location patterns may have been affected by Christmas and New Year holidays during this survey period. 
Among working adults:
around 3 in 10 (32%) reported working from home at some point in the past seven days (32% in the previous period)
6 in 10 (60%) reported travelling to work at some point in the past seven days (72% in the previous period)
around 1 in 10 (11%) reported both working from home and travelling to work in the past seven days (18% in the previous period) 
around one-third (34%) reported that, compared with before the pandemic, they are more likely to work from home if they have a cold (37% in the previous period)
Around two-thirds (66%) of adults reported having received two coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations and a booster, compared with 46% in the previous period. 
Among adults who have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine but not yet a booster, around 9 in 10 (89%) said they would be very likely or fairly likely to have a booster COVID-19 vaccine if offered to them. Meanwhile, 6% said they would be very unlikely or fairly unlikely to have a booster vaccine if offered.
The most common reasons respondents gave for being very or fairly unlikely to have the booster vaccine if offered were: 
thinking the booster vaccine would not offer them any extra protection (45% compared with 58% in the previous period)
thinking the first and second vaccine would be enough to keep them safe (33% compared with 44% in the previous period)
being worried about having a bad reaction to the booster jab (29% compared with 30% in the previous period)
being worried about long-term effects on their health (17% compared with 47% in the previous period)
Of all adults with a child aged between 12 and 15 years living in their household, more than half (54%) said the child had already received a COVID-19 vaccine (50% in the previous period). Around one-quarter (26%) reported the child would be very likely or fairly likely to receive it, a slight decrease from 30% in the previous period, while around 1 in 10 (12%) reported the child would be very unlikely or fairly unlikely to receive it, similar to the previous period (13%).

The estimates presented here are based on self-reports from a sample of adults and may differ from official administrative data on the number of individuals, including children aged 12 to 15 years, who have received COVID-19 vaccines and booster vaccines in Great Britain and its constituent countries. 



Around 1 in 10 (9%) adults had been asked to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test in the past seven days (excluding when travelling abroad) compared with 8% in the previous period. This was highest among younger people (18% of those aged 16 to 29 years) compared with older people (8% of those aged 30 to 49 years, 7% of those aged 50 to 60 years and 3% of those aged 70 years and over). 
The most frequently reported settings where adults were asked for proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test in order to attend were:
a theatre or comedy performance (21%)
a nightclub or bar (19%)
an indoor concert (17%)
a work or training event (14%)
a sporting event (12%)
Almost 6 in 10 adults (57%) said they had taken a rapid lateral flow test in the past seven days (42% in the previous period). 
Higher proportions of younger adults took rapid lateral flow tests (65% of those aged 16 to 29 years and 30 to 49 years) compared with older adults (54% of those aged 50 to 69 years and 38% of those aged 70 years and over). 
The most common reasons for taking a test were: 
before meeting family and friends (46%)
before going to work or college (29%)
doing so at regular intervals regardless of activity (25%)
feeling ill or having cold- or flu-like symptoms (22%)
Around 1 in 14 adults (7%) reported self-isolating because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the past seven days, a slight increase from 5% in the previous period.
The main reasons adults self-isolated were:
having tested positive for COVID-19 (30%)
having been in contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19 (28%)
being worried about catching COVID-19 (17%)
Around 43% of adults reported they always or often maintained social distancing when outside their home in the past seven days (40% in the previous period). 
According to age, this was higher among older adults compared with younger adults: 58% of those aged 70 years and over, 52% of those aged 50 to 69 years, 37% of those aged 30 to 49 years, and 25% of those aged 16 to 29 years.
Among those who reported they are clinically extremely vulnerable, more than half (55%) said they always or often maintained social distancing when outside their home in the past seven days compared with 42% of those who are not.
Overall, most adults (86%) reported they felt social distancing was important or very important in slowing the spread of COVID-19 (87% in the previous period).
Over 6 in 10 adults (63%) reported they avoided physical contact with others outside their home in the past seven days (57% in the previous period). 
Higher proportions of older adults reported this compared with younger adults: 74% of those aged 70 years and over, 66% of those aged 50 to 69 years, 60% of those aged 30 to 49 years, and 52% of those aged 16 to 29 years.
Clinically extremely vulnerable adults were more likely to report they avoided physical contact with others outside their home in the past seven days than those who are not (71% compared with 62%). This was also similar for those who reported they are disabled (69%) compared with those who are not (61%).
When friends and family had come into their home, the most common actions adults reported taking to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 were:
washing hands regularly (36%; 32% in the previous period)
opening windows or doors (26%; 20% in the previous period)
maintaining social distancing (22%; 17% in the previous period)
cleaning touch points (18%; 13% in the previous period)
Around 4 in 10 adults (38%) reported friends and family had not come into their home in the past seven days, a slight decrease from the previous period (45%).
Around 7 in 10 (69%) adults met up or socialised indoors, while almost half (47%) of adults met up or socialised outdoors, with others outside their household in the past seven days (excluding for work or education). This is similar to the previous period at 68% and 46% respectively. A higher proportion of younger adults met up or socialised outdoors with others outside their household (64% of those aged 16 to 29 years) compared with older adults (43% of those aged 30 to 49 years, 44% of those aged 50 to 69 years, and 41% of those aged 70 years and over). There were no significant differences between age groups for those who met with others indoors.
Almost half of adults (47%) felt they had enough information about how to protect themselves from COVID-19, compared with around one-third (32%) of adults feeling they did not have enough information to protect themselves. In addition, the majority of adults (93%) felt they had enough information about the UK’s plan to deal with the pandemic, with 2% of adults feeling they did not. 
The personal well-being measures during this period were: 
life satisfaction: 7.0 - unchanged from the previous period (6.7 in a similar period last year, 22 December 2020 to 3 January 2021)
feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile: 7.3 - unchanged from the previous period (7.2 in a similar period last year)
happiness: 7.0 - unchanged from the previous period (6.9 in a similar period last year)
anxiety: 4.2 - a slight increase compared with 4.0 in the previous period (4.0 in a similar period last year)
Around one-third of adults (35%) reported they expect life to return to normal in more than a year (39% in the previous period, and an increase from 20% in a similar period last year: 22 December 2020 to 3 January 2021), while around 1 in 8 (13%) said that they never expect this to happen (14% in the previous period, and 3% in a similar period last year).
Around 1 in 14 (7%) adults reported they expected life to return to normal in less than six months (unchanged from the previous period, and down from 25% in a similar period last year), while around 1 in 20 (4%) felt their life had already returned to normal.1
Among all adults, around two-thirds (66%) were very or somewhat worried about the effect that the pandemic is having on their lives (56% in the previous period, and 75% in a similar period last year: 22 December 2020 to 3 January 2021). Meanwhile, around 1 in 8 (12%) reported that they are somewhat unworried or not worried at all about the impact on their lives (16% in the previous period, and 10% in a similar period last year).
Among those who reported they are clinically extremely vulnerable, 73% said they were very or somewhat worried about the effect that the pandemic is having on their lives compared with 65% who are not clinically extremely vulnerable. This was similar among those who reported they are disabled (72%) compared with those who are not disabled (64%). 
In this period, we asked adults about their travel and social plans during the Christmas period and actions they took (or were planning to take) to help reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
The most frequently reported travel and social activities planned over the Christmas period were:
visiting family or friends in their homes (63%, 62% in the previous period)
having family or friends visit me in my home (51%, 48% in the previous period)
meeting up with family or friends in restaurants, pubs, bars or cafes (29%, 34% in the previous period)

washing their hands regularly (77%, 79% in the previous period)
staying at home if feeling unwell (73%, 80% in the previous period)
wearing a face covering (72%, 71% in the previous period)
socially distancing where possible (68%, 71% in the previous period)
In this period, we continued to ask adults whether they had experienced shortages of any goods at any time in the past two weeks. Around one-third (32%) of adults reported experiencing shortages (31% in the previous period).
Around 1 in 7 (15%) reported they had not been able to buy essential food because it was not available, up slightly from 13% in the previous period. When food shopping, around 6 in 10 (57%) reported experiencing some differences compared with the usual. The most commonly reported differences were:
less variety in the shops (37%)
items needed were not available, but a replacement was found (18%)
spending more than usual to get what I normally buy (18%)
items needed were not available, and a replacement could not be found (16%)
In this period, less than 1 in 20 (4%) adults reported they were unable to buy medicine because it was unavailable. Around one-quarter (26%) of adults who had tried to buy medicine or get a prescription, reported experiencing some differences compared with the usual (22% in the previous period). The most commonly reported differences were:
having to wait longer for their prescription (16%)
having to go to more pharmacies to find what they needed (6%)
items needed were not available, but a replacement could be found (4%)

There were participants who retired sooner than they were intending to as they had been made redundant during the pandemic.
Others were put on furlough, and because of this, left their job as a paid employee to become self-employed.
Participants who became self-employed during the pandemic did not intend to return to their previous job, as they preferred the work and flexibility.
Overall, those in our sample generally moved or stayed out of the job market after the pandemic because of complex and interrelated factors, including being unable to find a job, their age, ill health, caring for others, concerns about catching COVID-19, and financial security (for example, from a pension or a spouse's salary).
Others returned to part-time work as they needed to top-up their pension and pay for unforeseen costs (for example, needing to relocate because of caring responsibilities).
There were female participants who reported being affected by the increase in retirement age from 60 to 66 years; they either lost several years of their pension or had to delay retirement.
Although there were participants whose mental and physical health had been negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic, changes to their health was not cited as a reason for them staying out of work.
","Rise in economic inactivity among over 50s driven by retirements
Economic inactivity among those aged 50 years and over has increased since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, following a historical downward trend over the previous 10 years.
The new Over 50s Lifestyle Study (OLS) asks those who left work during the pandemic about why they left and whether they intend to return.
Of those who had not returned to work, retirement was by far the most common reason for leaving paid work among people aged 50 to 70 years (47%), followed by the coronavirus pandemic (15%).
Compared with those who left work before the pandemic, those who left during the pandemic were more likely to:
 - have left work sooner than they were expecting (63% compared with 54%)
 - have left work not by choice (25% compared with 20%)
 - consider returning to work (39% compared with 19%)

Recent findings, reported in Movements out of work for those aged over 50 years since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, showed an increase in the proportion of people aged 50 years and over who have become economically inactive since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This reversed the historical falling trend in inactivity for this age group in the last 10 years.
The Over 50s Lifestyle Study (OLS) was designed to gather more information from adults aged 50 to 70 years who had told us in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) in 2021 that they had left work. The aim was to better understand the attitudes and motivations for leaving work and whether they intend to return.
This qualitative report presents the findings of a follow-on study from the new Over 50s Lifestyle Study (OLS). The Office for National Statistics (ONS) conducted 21 semi-structured interviews to explore the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the lifestyles of people aged 50 to 70 years. This project adopted a rapid qualitative research approach to provide timely insights into how the pandemic has affected participants' employment status, financial circumstances and health. It also looked into why there is a trend in people within that age group not returning to work after the pandemic.
This article is one of three analytical articles covering findings from this study. You can find out more about these articles in Section 8: Related links
This section of the report will discuss why participants stopped working or became self-employed during or before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It will also discuss whether they intend to return to work or not and why, and whether there is anything that can be done to help participants to return to work after the pandemic.
This analysis takes a thematic approach and examines participants' employment status, financial situation and health separately. However, there were complex, inter-related factors that led participants to stop working and, at times, multiple barriers that prevented them from returning to work. For example, there were participants who retired partly because of their age, and partly because of ill health. There were also participants who said they weren't looking for paid work because they would be paid less in benefits. These factors will be explored in more depth throughout the report.
There were participants who said they had retired before the pandemic on account of:
feeling financially able to
feeling ready to enjoy their retirement
experiencing work-related stress 
increased pressures at work
not wanting to work long hours anymore
their age
their caring responsibilities
their poor health or disability
There were participants who were unable to work because of caring responsibilities and had left work before the pandemic. They:
felt they had ""no choice"" but to stop their self-employed work to care for their spouse
felt they might be ""stretched far too thin"" if they had to work and care
could only complete ""a very small amount of work"" to still ""receive carer's allowance"", for example, gardening or selling things on online
There were participants who left work before the pandemic to fulfil caring responsibilities but returned to part-time work during the pandemic. They were unable to return full-time because of their unpaid family caring responsibilities.
There were participants who had become self-employed before the pandemic because they wanted more flexibility, the ability to make their own decisions and ""control"" of their income.
There were participants who said their employment status changed during the pandemic. For example, there were participants who said their employer had furloughed staff and made redundancies to cut costs during the pandemic. Those participants said they chose to take redundancy as they were planning to retire soon anyway. Therefore, the pandemic had ""influenced [them] a little"" to retire sooner.
There were participants who were not planning to return to work as an employee after the pandemic, but instead planned to stay in self-employment or retire.
There were unemployed or economically inactive participants not planning to return to work because:
they would not have the energy to work because of their illness
returning to work would make them feel too anxious or stressed
they would receive less money from paid employment compared with benefits
they did not want to give up their voluntary work
they were ""quite happy with the life that [they've] got""
they did not feel comfortable moving places of work and having to meet new people
they found the new skills that were required complicated, for example, learning how to operate a cash register
There were participants who became self-employed during the pandemic because their income had been significantly reduced on account of being on furlough (for example, while working as a teaching assistant). Those participants said they intended to stay self-employed because they had more flexibility and preferred the work.
Retired participants generally said they had no intention of returning to work because they:
were in a financially fortunate position and ""didn't need to work anymore""
felt they had worked for long enough and wanted to rest
were enjoying the change of lifestyle ""too much""
felt their ill health prevented them from doing so
felt there was an ""age discrimination"" barrier to them returning to work
felt it would be hard to find a job during the pandemic because everything had ""closed down""; however, despite coronavirus restrictions being lifted, those participants still had no intention of coming out of retirement because of their age, ill health and financial security
felt they were too old to retrain and return to work
felt it was not worth the ""stress""
did not want to risk catching COVID-19 and potentially passing it on - the pandemic made them ""scared"" to return to their job
There were also participants who were self-employed and semi-retired, who said:
it would affect their tax
they would only take on work which allows them to take their dog with them
Participants described the barriers to finding work. There were economically inactive or unemployed participants who lost or left their job prior to the pandemic and who were currently searching for a job, but had not returned to work after the pandemic because:
there was ""not much choice"" and they had been unable to find a job they wanted
they had been rejected for jobs - they felt this was because companies were less willing to employ older staff and only wanted to employ younger people with IT skills since the pandemic
they felt it was unnecessary to ""slog myself in a job I don't want"", especially when they were in a comfortable financial position on account of their partner's salary
of their health condition
Participants also indicated that online applications, age discrimination, and a lack of available help for carers may be barriers to finding work. Unemployed participants were asked if there was anything that would help them return to work. They said they would benefit from:
help with filling out online application forms
less age discrimination by employers
Participants who were not intending to return to work said having the opportunity for further training or developing their skills would not change their opinion on whether to return or not.
Participants felt there was a misconception that full-time carers use caring as an excuse not to work.
Participants were asked whether they would return to the same role or sector if they were able to return to work. There were retired participants who were not planning to return to work, but felt that if they did want to, they would struggle to return to the sector they worked in previously (for example, market research). This was because of age discrimination, and they suspected they might have to take a ""lesser job"" (for example, in a supermarket).
There were full-time carers who said:
they would ideally return to the sector they previously worked in (for example, the motorsport engineering industry) on a self-employed basis, but would probably have to look for a job in the care sector as they had left the sector they previously worked in because of caring responsibilities
they might be encouraged to apply the skills learnt in their caring role and would not necessarily be motivated by the financial aspects of a job
There were self-employed swimming instructors and yoga teachers who were unable to work during the pandemic because of leisure facility closures, but did not receive financial support during this time. However, they have since returned to work.
There were semi-retired participants who said they had returned to, or continued with, part-time or occasional work (for example, yoga teaching, consultancy, or journalism) since retiring because they:
needed extra funds to top up their pension
needed to pay for unforeseen costs, for example, needing to relocate to be nearer elderly parents to visit them more often
liked to earn extra money
enjoyed the work they did previously
Additionally, there were those who said they hadn't considered fully retiring because they work from home and their work is not ""physically demanding"".
There were retired and economically inactive participants who cared for their grandchildren, however, there were mixed responses to whether the amount of care had changed during the pandemic. There were participants who:
spent more time looking after their grandchildren as their children were employed during the pandemic and couldn't afford childcare; this affected their decision to return to work because they would rather spend time with their grandchildren than work
thought the amount they cared for their grandchildren decreased during the pandemic because their children could work from home
Participants' financial situations were varied with examples of having improved, worsened, and stayed about the same during the coronavirus pandemic. There were participants who said their financial situation had worsened since the start of the pandemic and were concerned:
about the rise in energy prices
about the lack of availability of cheaper products in the supermarket
that they would start to ""struggle to pay the bills""
There were also:
full-time unpaid family carers who had ""a lot less money now"" compared with the start of the pandemic, because they had to stop working to provide full-time care for their spouse
participants who worked as teaching assistants and were unable to work and were furloughed - they found the payments insufficient and enrolled on universal credit before becoming self-employed
participants who had since returned to employment in a Higher Education Institution who said the cost of living had increased since the start of the pandemic because of ""more costs running the house"" when working from home
Other participants said their financial situation had not changed on account of the pandemic because:
their pension was good, so they were not significantly affected, despite losing income from working on a part-time, or a semi-retired and self-employed basis
their income from letting out property was unaffected by the pandemic as their tenants continued to pay rent
despite the cost of living (including council tax) increasing, their situation had stayed ""flat"" as they had also started receiving pension payments - there were participants with caring responsibilities ""cut as many corners"" as possible to reduce expenditure, for example, not going to the pub and not having a car or TV
they did not feel it had added any ""financial burden"", as despite leaving their job at the start of the pandemic, they had personal savings, could rely on their partner's salary, or had already paid off their mortgage
There were retired participants who said their financial situation, if anything, had ""improved"" during the pandemic because:
their expenses decreased, for example, from not going on holiday, using less petrol, and not going on days out; however, their expenditure has increased recently as they are ""making up for lost time"" by going on more days out or holidays
their stocks and shares investments did ""exceptionally well"" because some technology companies' share prices increased; however, they said the stock market is now ""dropping back"" on account of political tensions
they have moved into a caravan to be mortgage free, and to live cheaply
a family member had died of COVID-19 and/or another illness so they inherited property and savings - they were able to rent out the house and give up full-time work, living on the rent until their pension came through
their spouse had started receiving their pension during the pandemic, which led to an increase in joint income
Participants were asked whether concerns about their financial situation would affect their decision to return to work after the pandemic. There were participants who would not return to work because:
""retirement is really good"" and is a reward for years of hard work
they ""place freedom higher than money""
they would be unable to give up caring for their spouse full-time, or return to work because of ill health, despite concerns about their financial situation and the rising cost of living
Others said their loss of income from self-employed work during the pandemic did not affect their decision to return to work, because their expenditure reduced during lockdown.
However, there were participants who would return to work on account of their financial situation because they:
had previously come out of retirement at 60-years-old and gone back to work because their pension would not allow them to retire at that time
said they might have to take on more self-employed work if their energy bills continued to rise (they were semi-retired)
would only return to work if their financial position drastically changed, for example, if their spouse died
There were retired participants who funded their retirement using:
a private or state pension
investments
inheritance
income from a property
savings
disability allowance and carers' benefits
Although male participants generally did not report being affected by changes to pension schemes, there were female participants who said they were because:
the retirement age was raised from 60 to 66-years-old without sufficient notice to change employment plans, so they lost several years of pension and associated benefits
they had to delay retirement and work for additional years
they felt ""bitter about the unfairness"" and ""very angry""
they had the option to drawdown their pension when they retired (subject to a penalty) but chose not to, as their spouse was still working and could support them both
There were other notable findings. For example, there were:
economically inactive participants who funded their time out of work by using their spouse's salary to support them
participants who supported their family with their finances, for example, helping them to buy property
Participants reported mixed experiences about changes to their health during the coronavirus pandemic. There were participants who said their health had stayed the same or improved during lockdown, as they lost weight from an improved diet and increased exercise. However, others said their physical health had worsened during the pandemic on account of:
living a more sedentary lifestyle and eating low-cost foods, which exacerbated their back pain or led to weight gain
being diagnosed with cancer
their health condition, which prevented them standing for long periods - this made preparing healthy meals difficult
a lack of advice, treatment, or face-to-face appointments with their doctor
Participants' mental health was affected by the pandemic in differing ways, with more examples of negative impacts than positive. There were retired participants who had ""enjoyed"" lockdown or said the isolation didn't ""bother them"". However, others said their mental health somewhat worsened because they felt ""lonely"", frustrated about not being able to go out or on holiday, or anxious about catching COVID-19 and their personal circumstances, for example, poor health.
Participants also said they felt anxious as it seemed the world had gone into ""turmoil"". However, they said that wouldn't prevent them from returning to work in the future, as their reasons were not ""work-related"".
Participants who were out of work because of illness or poor mental health said their mental health had:
stayed the same during the pandemic, on account of having support from friends or taking anti-depressants
worsened because of the pandemic, as they experienced isolation from their family, were confronted with mortality, bereavement, a loss of income and anxiety about contracting COVID-19
There were also participants who found returning to work as an employee “overwhelming” after shielding during the pandemic.
There were mixed views about access to NHS healthcare during the pandemic. There were participants who said access to NHS healthcare had been fast and ""flexible"", as they were able to arrange appointments for the same day and attend online consultations rather than face to face. However, other participants described access to healthcare during the pandemic as ""pretty poor"". Participants said they:
felt they had ""more chance of getting an appointment with God""
felt the NHS ""weren't really there for us"" during the pandemic
had paid to see a doctor privately
had to wait for minor surgery, and as a result have experienced discomfort or a worsening of their health condition
had concerns about hospital wait times in case they had, for example, a heart attack, particularly as their local hospital can get ""swamped""
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with a structured topic guide over Microsoft Teams or the telephone. Interviewers were trained in conducting interviews on sensitive topics.
This project adopted a rapid qualitative research approach. Interviewers were paired with a trained observer, who took detailed notes in a standardised observation sheet. The pair debriefed each interview to compare and compile findings. This cross-validation helped to assure quality and allowed the research team to collate high-level findings as interviews proceeded.
All participants took part in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) between January and December 2021, as well as the follow-up Over 50s Lifestyle Study (OLS) between 8 and 13 February 2022. Participants had consented for the ONS to contact them about taking part in future research.
All participants were aged 50 to 70 years, and the purposive sample consisted of a mix of genders and participants from urban, suburban, and rural locations. The sample consisted of:
eight fully retired participants, including one who had caring responsibilities at the start of pandemic, which prevented them from returning to work
five self-employed participants, including people who were unpaid family carers and/or semi-retired 
five economically inactive or unemployed participants, including those who were unemployed because of illness or disability 
three participants who were unpaid family workers - carers who cared for a spouse full-time, including one who had left work before the pandemic because of caring responsibilities, but has returned after the pandemic for financial reasons
The sample included those who left work during the pandemic and those who left before. There were participants who fitted more than one sample criteria, for example, those who were unpaid family carers and self-employed, or those who were semi-retired and self-employed. Of the eight retired participants, three retired during the pandemic, and the other five retired before.
Participants who were unemployed or economically inactive were mostly aged under 60 years, whereas self-employed and unpaid family carers were mostly aged under 65 years. Retired or semi-retired participants were generally aged 65 and over. None of the retired participants were aged under 60 years.
There were participants whose job or sector was affected because of the pandemic, which led to a change in their employment status. For example, those who worked in the leisure, education, engineering (motorsport) and real estate industries.

In this article, we refer to the number of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households, and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings in England.
This article presents analysis on past infections, which we define as testing positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland – based on findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) in the UK. This article also presents analysis on the characteristics of those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 – the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 disease in England. We include current COVID-19 infections, which we define as testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. 
More information on our headline estimates of the overall number of positive cases in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are available in our latest bulletin. It should be noted that the analysis on the characteristics and behaviours of those testing positive in this article is for an older time period than the headline figures presented in the most recent bulletin. The reference periods for the various analyses are clearly stated at the start of each section.
Further information on what the analysis covers is provided at the start of each section.

The analysis in this section of the article is based on blood test results taken from a randomly selected subsample of individuals aged 16 years and over, which are used to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This can be used to identify individuals who have had the infection in the past.
It takes between two and three weeks for the body to make enough antibodies to fight the infection but once a person recovers, antibodies remain in the blood at low levels, although these levels can decline over time to the point that tests can no longer detect them. Having antibodies can help to prevent individuals from getting the same infection again.
We measure the presence of antibodies to understand who has had COVID-19 in the past, although the length of time antibodies remain at detectable levels in the blood is not fully known. It is also not yet known how having detectable antibodies, now or at some time in the past, affects the chance of getting COVID-19 again.
The analysis in this section is different to the analysis and results presented in later sections of this article, which are based on swab test results identifying current infections. We present weighted monthly estimates of antibody positivity for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. We also present the weighted estimates of antibody positivity for regions of England.
In November 2020, an estimated 8.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.2% to 9.3%) of the population in England would have tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample. The estimate is weighted to be representative of the overall population, and suggests that an average of 3.9 million people aged 16 years and over in England would have tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 during this time (95% confidence interval: 3.7 million to 4.2 million). This equates to 1 in 11 people aged 16 years and over (95% confidence interval: 1 in 12, to 1 in 11). Weighted estimates of the percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by month in England are presented in Figure 1; the estimates suggest there has been an increase in antibody positivity in the most recent month.
The analysis in this section uses data taken from November 2020 to produce weighted antibodies estimates. There is substantial variation in antibody positivity between regions, from 12.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.4% to 14.5%) in London compared with 3.9% (95% confidence interval: 2.8% to 5.3%) in the South West. The populations in the South and East of England have positivity rates below the England national average.
Confidence intervals are large for some regions indicating high uncertainty in those estimates but there is still evidence of differences in the percentage of people testing positive for antibodies between regions.
In November 2020, an estimated 5.5% of the population in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample (95% confidence interval: 3.6% to 8.0%). It is estimated that an average of 140,000 people aged over 16 years in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies during this time (95% confidence interval: 91,000 to 203,000). This equates to 1 in 18 people aged 16 years and over (95% confidence interval: 1 in 28, to 1 in 12). 
While it appears that antibody rates have increased since the summer, uncertainty is high as the confidence intervals are wide. 
In November 2020, an estimated 3.3% of the population in Northern Ireland would have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample (95% confidence interval: 1.6% to 6.0%). It is estimated that an average of 49,000 people aged over 16 years in Northern Ireland would have tested positive for antibodies during this time (95% confidence interval: 23,000 to 89,000). This equates to 1 in 31 people aged 16 years and over (95% confidence interval: 1 in 64, to 1 in 17).
There is no evidence of a trend over time and confidence intervals are wide.
In November 2020, an estimated 7.3% of the population in Scotland would have tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample (95% confidence interval: 5.0% to 10.3%). It is estimated that an average of 326,000 people aged over 16 years in Scotland would have tested positive for antibodies during this time (95% confidence interval: 222,000 to 458,000). This equates to 1 in 14 people aged 16 years and over (95% confidence interval: 1 in 20, to 1 in 10).
There is no evidence of a trend over time, as the confidence intervals are wide and we do not currently have estimates for enough months to analyse the trend.
The total percentage of people in England estimated to have had the coronavirus (COVID-19) over time from the start of the survey up until the most recent week available is presented in our weekly bulletin, which reports the percentage of people testing positive continues to decrease in the most recent week (between 29 November and 5 December 2020).
This section provides the modelled estimates on positivity rates by patient-facing and non-patient-facing roles by age, with the two occupational groups split between those aged under 35 years and those 35 years and above. The modelling used is similar to that used to produce national trend modelling of COVID-19 infections in our weekly bulletin. More information about the methods used in the model is available in our methodology article.
The models used to produce positivity rates for patient-facing and non-patient-facing roles include only swab test results from individuals of working-age (aged 16 to 74 years), as these characteristics are only relevant for this group of people. This analysis covers the time period between 1 August and 28 November 2020, which is from the lowest point of positivity rates over the summer to the most recent data available for this analysis.
In the most recent week (22 to 28 November 2020), the proportion of those testing positive has decreased in all groups apart from those in a patient-facing role aged 35 years and over, where there is less certainty in the direction of the trend.
This contrasts with analysis in our previous article published in November, where we reported there was evidence that rates were higher among those working in patient-facing roles aged under 35 years compared with those not working in patient-facing roles aged under 35 years. Additionally, positivity rates had increased in both patient-facing and non-patient-facing roles for both those aged under 35 years and those aged 35 years and over.

This section covers the likelihood of individuals testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) from nose and throat swabs by ethnicity, region and occupation. For this analysis, because of low numbers, ethnicity has been grouped into two categories; White ethnic group and Other ethnic group. The results are presented in two types of analyses:
This analysis considers the impacts of ethnicity on the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and whether this effect varies over time. It includes all swab test results from the entire population regardless of age (individuals aged two years and over) between 4 October and 28 November 2020. 
This analysis considers whether people ever tested positive or always tested negative on swab tests between 1 September and 28 November 2020. It includes all participants of working-age (those aged 16 to 74 years).
Both analyses adjust for a set of general characteristics: age, region and ethnicity. 
The second analysis also adjusts for sex in all the models, and most models also adjust for sociodemographics: household size, whether the household was multigenerational, and Index of Multiple Deprivation (PDF, 2.19MB) score¹. 
Estimates are modelled to identify the risk associated with each characteristic, while controlling for the effects of other characteristics. This gives a better reflection of the true risk associated with each characteristic. This approach differs from our previous article, in which positivity rates over time for each characteristic were presented. More information on the modelling used is available in Section 7: COVID-19 Infection Survey methodology. 
Results are presented as odds ratios. When a characteristic (for example, being male) has an odds ratio of one, this means that there is neither an increase nor a decrease in the likelihood of infection compared with a reference category (for example, being female). An odds ratio of higher than one means that there is an increased likelihood of infection compared with the reference category. An odds ratio of lower than one means that there is a reduced likelihood of infection compared with the reference category. For the purpose of this analysis, the models always show the likelihood of individuals in the “Other” ethnic group testing positive for COVID-19 compared with individuals in the “White” ethnic group (the reference category). 
The odds ratios are presented with 95% confidence intervals. If the range of the confidence interval crosses the threshold of one, we cannot say with any certainty whether infection is more or less likely for that characteristic compared with the reference category, even if the estimate is not close to one. In some instances, this will be because we estimate there to be no differences (where the odds ratio estimate is close to one), but it can also reflect less information about a characteristic in our sample. 
The first part of this analysis considers the impacts of ethnicity on the likelihood of testing positive and whether this effect varies over time, using the variation over time model. The analysis showed that the impact of region and age on the likelihood of testing positive varied significantly over time, as in our main bulletins. Having adjusted for changing positivity rates in different regions and ages, there was evidence that the effect of ethnicity varied across the different regions.
Individuals from the Other ethnic group had significantly greater positivity rates in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, and the South East. Confidence intervals were wide for the South West and the North East so it is not possible to say whether individuals from the Other ethnic group were more likely to test positive in those regions. 
There was no evidence supporting a lower risk of testing positive in those from the Other ethnic group in any region.
After adjusting for differential effects of ethnicity by region, there was no evidence that the effect of ethnicity varied over time or by age.

The second part of this analysis considers whether the impact of ethnicity varies by occupation. In order to do this, we produced a series of models factoring in a range of key variables that are likely to affect positivity rates to better isolate the impact of ethnicity and occupation.
We explored the likelihood of working-age individuals ever testing positive between 1 September and 28 November 2020 dependent on ethnicity, adjusting only for region, sex and age, using a second model. This was done in order to subsequently assess the additional effect of occupation. The results from this model can be found in our dataset. As in Figure 7, there was strong evidence that the effect of ethnicity varied by region. 
The exact odds ratios vary slightly from those presented in Figure 7 as the model included a different age range, time period, and outcome (ever or never positive since September) however, the overall findings are consistent between the two analyses. 
Our third model, presented in Figure 8, considered how much of the total effect of ethnicity could be explained by the sociodemographics: household size, whether the household was multigenerational, and Index of Multiple Deprivation score.1 
Adjusting for these factors slightly reduced the effect of ethnicity, however variation across regions remained similar to the previous model. This suggests that likelihood of testing positive varies by ethnicity and region, even when taking into account the sociodemographic factors.

In the final model we added occupational sector to explore whether this explains variation in the likelihood of people of different ethnicities testing positive, and whether there is any evidence that it changes this likelihood.
This analysis found that the effect of ethnicity varied both by region and by occupation sector, meaning that the effect of being from the Other ethnic group compared with the White ethnic group in different occupation sectors varied by region. However, while levels vary by region, the pattern of which occupations have a higher or lower risk for those of White ethnicity compared with the Other ethnicity group is relatively similar across all regions. 
An example of these similar patterns is displayed in Figure 9 and Figure 10, odds ratios for the East Midlands and London, respectively. Data for all other regions can be found in the accompanying dataset.
Across regions, people from the Other ethnic group had the highest risk of testing positive compared with those in the White ethnic group in the following occupations; social care, personal services and the arts, entertainment and recreation industry. 
The lowest relative risk for people from the Other ethnic group was for those working in information technology.
There was also a higher relative risk for those in the Other ethnic group who were not working because they were retired or unemployed. 
In some regions excess risk was also apparent in those working in financial services, and other occupations; in the North West and East Midlands, the overall higher risk associated with those in the Other ethnic group compared with the White ethnic group meant that excess risk was apparent in most occupations.

The analysis in this section looks at the number of people outside their own home that individuals report having socially distanced and physical contact with, regardless of whether they tested positive or negative for the coronavirus (COVID-19). We provide the number of contacts for school-age children (school Year 11 and below) and adults (older than school Year 11), and categorise contacts as follows:
0 (no reported contact)
1 to 5 (reported contacts)
6 to 10 (reported contacts)
11 to 20 (reported contacts)
21 or more (reported contacts)
We asked individuals how many people aged 17 years and under, 18 to 69 years, and 70 years and over, outside their household, they have had contact with up to seven days prior to each visit. “Contact” refers to either of the following:
socially distanced contact – direct contact with social distancing only
physical contact – physical contact, such as a handshake or personal care, including PPE if worn
This analysis covers the time period between 27 September and 30 November 2020, which is when questions on contacts were included in our survey. We have produced estimates that have been weighted to be representative of the total population in England.
We present the proportion of school-age children by each category of socially distanced contact in Figure 11. Our analysis suggests that there was an increase in “21 or more” socially distanced contacts with people aged 17 years and under from September onwards, corresponding to school-age individuals going back to school and coming into contact with their peers. 
There was a decrease in the number of socially distanced contacts with people aged 17 years and under in late October to early November, corresponding to the half term break from school, which then returned to a similar number of contacts as before half term.
There is a similar pattern of increased socially distanced contacts with people aged 18 to 69 years from September onwards, which is likely to relate to the increased contact with teachers and parents. 
Over time, the number of socially distanced contacts with people aged 70 years and over has decreased.

Across all ages of socially distanced contacts, in adults the number of socially distanced contacts has decreased over time from late September or early October, which could be because of tighter local and national restrictions.

The trends in physical contacts in school-age children are very similar to socially distanced contacts trends, aligning to schools returning in September. 
The greatest increase was in “21 or more” physical contacts with people aged 17 years and under in mid to late September, however this increase was proportionally less than the socially distanced contact counts presented. There is a similar pattern of increased physical contacts with people aged 18 to 69 years from September, likely because of schools reopening.
Trends in physical contacts over time in adults are very similar to socially distanced contact trends, but there are more respondents that have had contact with zero individuals.
The results of our physical contacts analysis can be found in our dataset.

","Schools report “some” or “major” challenges in implementing most measures to curb coronavirus spread
Most schools report encountering either “some” or “major” challenges in implementing measures to control the spread of coronavirus during the Autumn term 2020.
School headteachers and their representatives were surveyed about which infection control measures had been put in place, and what challenges this presented.
Almost all primary schools surveyed reported implementing all 10 infection control measures recommended by the Department for Education, while most secondary schools (91%) reported implementing at least 12 of 15 recommended measures. The least commonly implemented measure was maintaining distance between pupils within bubbles.
While all schools had a “bubble” system in place during the Autumn term, bubbles in primary schools were most commonly the same size as usual class sizes, while most secondary schools had bubbles consisting of an entire year group.
Measures to maintain distancing within bubbles, such as staff keeping two metres from students, were more likely to present “major” challenges for schools, particularly in primary schools.
Staff staying home if they or another member of their household had COVID-19 symptoms also presented major challenges in more than a quarter of schools.
Hygiene measures, such as staff regularly washing hands, were more commonly regarded as easy to implement, as was banning large gatherings such as assemblies, although primary schools were more likely to say these measures were “easy to implement” than secondary schools.

Unless otherwise stated the confidence intervals around the point estimates of the comparisons overlap. 



121 schools (41 primary, 80 secondary) in 15 local authorities participated in the second round of testing; Within these schools, 12,203 participants (5,114 staff and 7,089 pupils) had at least one test in Round 2 of which, 7,751 participants took part in both Rounds 1 and 2 (3,322 staff and 4,429 pupils).
Coronavirus antibodies 
In Round 2, 14.61% of primary staff tested positive for antibodies compared with 15.72% of secondary staff; in Round 1 (3 to 19 November 2020), 12.63% of primary staff in the local authorities sampled tested positive for antibodies based on blood tests, compared with 12.27% of secondary staff.
In Round 1, 7.65% of primary school pupils tested positive for antibodies based on oral fluids, and 10.95% of secondary pupils tested positive; this is lower than the staff population, particularly in primary schools. Caution should be taken as the type of antibody test is different and pupil antibody data from Round 2 are not yet available to see how this changed over the Autumn term
Coronavirus (COVID-19) current infection 
In Round 2, primary pupils and staff, in school on the day of testing, had a slightly lower percentage testing positive (0.94% and 0.99% respectively) for the coronavirus (COVID-19) than secondary pupils and staff (1.22% and 1.64%).
School implementation of coronavirus control measures
Almost all primary schools included in the survey (38) reported implementing 10 measures strongly recommended in Department for Education (DfE) guidance.
91% of secondary schools reported implementing at least 12 of 15 strongly recommended measures; the least commonly implemented measure was maintaining distance between pupils within bubbles.
Efforts to ensure symptomatic individuals stayed at home, enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols, limiting gatherings (assemblies, sports, after-school activities), and staff distancing from other adults were near universally implemented.
All schools implemented a “bubble” system, though there was variation in whether this applied to class sizes (more common in primary schools) or year groups (more common in secondary schools).
Primary schools focused on limiting pupils mixing between bubbles, but less on limiting contacts between staff and pupil in the same bubble.
Secondary schools more commonly than primary schools implemented measures to limit contact within the same bubble or class (for example, forward-facing desks, teacher remaining at front of class), but had lower implementation of measures to limit contact between bubbles.

The COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey aims to investigate the prevalence of current coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and presence of antibodies to COVID-19 among pupils and staff in sampled primary and secondary schools in England, measured at half-termly intervals during the school year. In addition, it aims to examine attendance of pupils and staff, school implementation measures and undertake detailed outbreak investigations in some schools.
SARS-CoV-2 is the scientific name given for the specific virus that causes COVID-19. Testing for antibodies can be used to identify individuals who have had the infection in the past or have developed antibodies as a result of vaccination (at the time of testing no participants would have received a vaccination). Further information can be found in our accompanying methodology article.
This bulletin presents initial estimates of staff and pupils testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies and current COVID-19 infection. These estimates are derived results from the first and second round of testing carried out in sampled schools between 3 and 19 November (Round 1), and 2 and 10 December 2020 (Round 2). Those tested in Round 1 and those tested in Round 2 are not necessarily the same individuals. 
9,732 participants (4,337 staff and 5,395 pupils) took part in Round 1 and 12,203 (5,114 staff and 7,089 pupils) participants took part in Round 2. This represents just over 40% of staff and around 15% of eligible pupils in the enrolled schools. Participation in a round is defined as having at least one test result from either an antibody or current COVID-19 infection. For additional information on response rates please see Measuring the data. 
The study oversampled schools in areas of the country where COVID-19 infection rates were high at the beginning of the 2020 to 2021 academic year. It covers schools in 15 local authorities in England. The sampling strategy has since been updated to increase the number of schools in the local authorities within the sample. For further detail on sample design please see our accompanying methodology article. 
For the purpose of this report, to allow meaningful comparisons, only data for local authorities that have both primary and secondary schools participating in both rounds are included in the aggregated test result data. Data for all 15 participating local authorities are provided separately (where the sample size allows). 
Unless otherwise stated, data in this bulletin are weighted so that the pupils and staff tested in each local authority are representative of the age, sex and ethnic background of all primary and secondary school pupils and staff in that local authority. The sample design means the data presented are not intended to be representative of all schools in England. For further detail on weighting of participants please see our accompanying methodology article.
Test results are only available for those who had enrolled in the survey and were present in the school building on the day of testing; under current guidance you would expect these participants to have no reported COVID-19 symptoms and not be under current self-isolation guidance.
This bulletin presents a summary of estimates, with further data contained in the associated dataset. Comparisons between groups should be done with caution because of the small sample size. Associated confidence intervals should be used to assess the statistical significance of the difference.
In Round 1 (3 to 19 November 2020), 12.63% of primary staff sampled tested positive for antibodies (95% confidence intervals: 9.74% to 16.00%) compared with 12.27% of secondary staff (95% confidence intervals: 10.58% to 14.13%). 
In Round 2 (2 to 10 December 2020), 14.61% of primary staff tested positive (95% confidence intervals: 11.86% to 17.72%) compared with 15.72% of secondary staff (95% confidence intervals: 14.01% to 17.55%). 
Weighted estimates of the percentage of staff testing positive for antibodies for Round 1 and Round 2 are presented in Figure 1.

In the case of the coronavirus (COVID-19), seroconversion is the incidence of antibody test results changing from negative to positive.
Of the 2,552 staff who took part in antibody testing in both rounds, 2,276 staff (651 primary and 1,625 secondary) tested negative in Round 1, and 276 staff (87 primary, 189 secondary) tested positive; 37 of the 2,276 staff (1.63% (95% confidence intervals: 1.15% to 2.23%)) converted from negative to positive. Of the 37 staff who converted from negative to positive, 9 (out of 651) were primary school staff and 28 (out of 1,625) were secondary school staff. 
Of the 276 staff who tested positive in Round 1, 20 (7.25% (95% confidence intervals: 4.48% to 10.97%)) tested negative in Round 2. Antibodies remain in the blood at low levels after infection, although these levels can decline over time to the point that tests can no longer detect them. The length of time antibodies remain at detectable levels in the blood is not fully known. 
There is also not yet good information on how having detectable antibodies, now or at some time in the past, affects the chance of getting COVID-19 again. Also note that the test used to detect antibodies is not 100% accurate and may not detect antibodies in a small fraction of individuals even when present.
Figure 2 shows the antibody positivity rates for secondary staff; in all local authorities sampled, antibody positivity rates were higher in Round 2. There was variation in Round 2 positivity rates between local authorities, and in the increase between Round 1 and Round 2, although the confidence intervals around the estimates are wide. 
In Round 2, Manchester had the highest positivity rate (27.95% compared with 18.49% in Round 1), and Reading had the lowest (2.86%; no data is available for Reading in Round 1). 
Equivalent data for primary school staff can be found in the dataset that accompanies this bulletin.

Currently, pupil antibody data is only available for Round 1 (3 to 19 November 2020). 
In Round 1, 7.65% of primary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 5.87% to 9.77%) and 10.95% of secondary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 8.78% to 13.45%) tested positive for antibodies based on oral fluid testing. The confidence intervals around these estimates overlap. Estimates of the percentage of pupils testing positive for antibodies for Round 1 are presented in Figure 3.
In primary schools, 12.63% of staff tested positive for antibodies in Round 1 based on blood tests (95% confidence intervals: 9.74% to 16.00%) compared with 7.65% of pupils (95% confidence intervals: 5.87% to 9.77%). 
In secondary schools, 12.27% of staff tested positive for antibodies in Round 1 (95% confidence intervals: 10.58% to 14.13%) compared with 10.95% of pupils (95% confidence intervals: 8.78% to 13.45%). The confidence intervals around these estimates overlap. Caution should be taken as the type of test for antibodies differed between staff and pupils. The oral fluid test was used to test for antibodies in pupils as it is non-invasive, however it does have a lower sensitivity than the finger prick blood test used for staff. More information can be found in our methodology article.

In the majority of local authorities, a higher percentage of secondary school pupils tested positive for antibodies than primary school pupils. Manchester, and Barking and Dagenham had the highest percentage of secondary school pupils testing positive (22.25% and 16.63% respectively). Norfolk, and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole had the lowest percentage (0.64% and 2.72% respectively) for secondary school pupils. 
Manchester and Barking and Dagenham had the highest percent testing positive (22.26% and 16.63% respectively) for secondary school pupils. Gateshead, and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole had the lowest percentage testing positive (2.34% and 1.70%) for primary school pupils.

In both Round 1 (3 to 19 November 2020) and Round 2 (2 to 10 December 2020), a lower proportion of pupils and staff in primary schools tested positive for current coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on the day of testing than those in secondary schools (Figure 5). The confidence intervals around all current infection estimates overlap.
For staff, 1.64% tested positive for current infection in secondary schools (95% confidence interval: 1.10% to 2.33%) and 0.99% in primary schools (95% confidence interval: 0.37% to 2.12%). 
For pupils, 1.22% in secondary schools (95% confidence interval: 0.60% to 2.20%) and 0.94% in primary schools (95% confidence interval 0.44% to 1.76%) tested positive for current infection. 
Download the data 
In Round 2, almost half of primary schools (46%, 19 of the 41 primary schools) and one-third of secondary schools (37%, 28 of the 75 tested secondary schools) that took part in swab tests had no cases of current COVID-19 infection on the test days among the just over 15% of pupils and 40% of staff who participated in the test. 
In Round 2, 17% of primary schools (7 of the 41 tested primary schools) and 33% of secondary schools (25 of the 75 tested secondary schools) had two or more cases. Within the schools with two or more cases, preliminary analysis suggests that around half of them had pupils testing positive for current infection in the same year group. Further data analysis will be done to investigate whether there was any potential link between cases in schools where we found two or more cases on the day of testing. 
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) provides analysis on the presence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies, which indicates if an individual has had the coronavirus (COVID-19) within the community population: community refers to private residential households, and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. Articles relating to Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: antibody data for the UK are available.
In order to be comparable with the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey, data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey cover the same local authorities that provided consistent coverage across both school types in Round 1 and Round 2. Caution should be taken as this comparison does not control for any characteristic differences between school staff and the working-age population (for example, age and sex), and staff working in a school in the local authorities sampled may not necessarily live in that local authority.
Antibody positivity rates for staff tested in the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey have been compared with antibody positivity estimates of working-age adults (those aged 18 to 65 years) in the same local authorities sampled in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for overlapping time periods. 
During Round 1 (3 to 19 November 2020) 12.51% of staff in the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey tested positive for antibodies (95% confidence interval: 10.50% to 14.74%), compared with the estimate of 12.61% (95% confidence interval: 9.81% to 15.86%) of working-age adults in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. 
During Round 2 (2 to 10 December 2020), 14.99% of staff tested positive for antibodies (95% confidence interval 13.05% to 17.10%), lower than the estimate of 18.22% (95% confidence interval 14.88% to 21.95%) for working-age adults in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey.
The confidence intervals around the above estimates all overlap.
Caution should be taken as this comparison does not control for any characteristic differences between school staff and the working-age population (for example, age and sex). 
Estimates show in primary and secondary school-age children, and in adults, the estimated percentage of those testing positive for current COVID-19 infection was lower in the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey compared with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. These estimates can be found in the dataset that accompanies this bulletin.
It is important to note that the data reported here for the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey only includes individuals who were present in the school on the day of testing. Anyone who had known contact with a positive case or was symptomatic on the day would have been advised to not attend school. Further information can be in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey methodology article.
Information on the implementation of infection control measures within schools is gained from a questionnaire, which is filled in by headteachers or their designated representatives. The following analysis looks at the responses from 105 schools about the Autumn term 2020, available in our accompanying dataset. More information on how this analysis was conducted can be read in Measuring the data. 
Almost all primary schools included in the survey (38) reported implementing all 10 measures strongly recommended in Department for Education (DfE) guidance. Few secondary schools included in the survey (67) implemented all 15 measures strongly recommended in DfE guidance, although 91% reported implementing at least 12 of the measures. This is presented in Figure 6, a heatmap for all measures in available in the dataset. 
The least commonly implemented measure was maintaining distance between pupils within bubbles. Measures were categorised as strongly recommended based on researchers’ analysis of DfE guidance, described in greater detail in Measuring the data.
All schools implemented a “bubble” system, though there was variation in whether this applied to class sizes (more common in primary schools) or year groups (more common in secondary). Table 1 summarises the implementation of bubbles across schools.
Efforts to ensure symptomatic individuals stayed at home, enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols, limiting gatherings (assemblies, sports, after-school activities), and staff distancing from other adults were near universally implemented across school types. 
In primary schools, consistent with DfE guidance, implementation efforts focused on limiting pupil mixing between bubbles, but less towards limiting contacts between staff and pupils in the same bubble. 
Secondary schools more commonly than primary schools implemented measures to limit contact within the same bubble or class (for example, forward-facing desks, teacher remaining at front of class), but had lower implementation of measures to limit contact between bubbles.
Download the data
Where schools had implemented measures, the implementation of most measures was reported as presenting “some” or “major” challenges. Those measures most commonly reported as “easy” to implement were: 
running ventilation systems through the day (but only present in 40% of secondary and few primary schools)
stopping gatherings (assemblies, sports, after school activities)
staff wearing face coverings and washing hands frequently
providing hand sanitiser
periodic opening of windows
and, in primary schools only, keeping pupils in the same classroom during the day. Data for all implementations are available in the accompanying dataset.

During the autumn and early winter months central and eastern European countries had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe; western European countries still experienced some excess mortality but at lower levels than those experienced in the spring.
Of all countries analysed, Poland had the greatest cumulative excess mortality (relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates, (rcASMRs)) by 18 December 2020, at 11.6% above the five-year average. 
The highest peak in weekly excess mortality (relative age-standardised mortality rates (rASMRs)) in the autumn was in Bulgaria, at 112.3% (week ending 27 November), but this was the second-highest peak in the year overall, behind Spain at 142.9% in week ending 3 April; the UK's highest peak was 101.5% (week ending 17 April).
The UK had among the highest excess mortality rates for people aged under 65 years; by 18 December it had the second highest cumulative excess mortality rate for this age group, behind Bulgaria. 
For those aged under 65 years, the UK had the second highest peak in weekly excess mortality rates across the year, at 62.7% above the five-year average during week ending 24 April, second to Bulgaria at 108.5% during week ending 27 November.
Cities of central and eastern Europe have suffered high excess mortality in the autumn and winter period; Sofia (112.5%) and Warsaw (103.8%) had the highest weekly excess mortality rates, however, their rates were much lower than those cities and regions affected during the spring, for example, Madrid (452.0%), Barcelona (266.0%) and London (228.4%). 
Excess mortality in the autumn and winter period at regional level has seen one or more areas in Poland, Belgium, Bulgaria and Switzerland record rates of 160.0% or more; these rates are much lower than those of the spring, where Bergamo in northern Italy recorded excess mortality of 841.7% and Sergovia in Spain of 593.8%. 
In the autumn and winter period the UK's highest rate was in Hackney and Newham Greater London at 233.2%.

This article looks at all-cause mortality as a comparable international indicator of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and does not specifically analyse deaths due to COVID-19.      



""While the UK may no longer have one of the highest levels of cumulative excess mortality in Europe, it does persist to have some of the highest cumulative excess mortality rates for those aged under 65 years. Only Bulgaria had a higher cumulative excess mortality rate for this age group by the end of 2020, with the UK and its constituent countries having excess mortality levels well above most other European countries. 
This has been a pattern observed throughout 2020 since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March showing that the impact of the pandemic in the UK has not exclusively affected those at the oldest ages. We are working to better understand the reasons behind this trend."" 
Dr Annie Campbell, Health Analysis and Life Events, Office for National Statistics
The best way of comparing the mortality impact internationally is by looking at all-cause mortality rates by local area, region and country compared with the five-year average. All-cause mortality avoids the problem of different countries recording COVID-19 deaths in different ways, and also takes into account the indirect impact of the pandemic, such as deaths from other causes that might be related to delayed access to healthcare.
This article has been designed to reflect deaths in the whole of the calendar year 2020 as far as possible and data up to 12 February 2021 for the UK. No division is made into ""waves"" of the pandemic as these patterns over time have varied between different countries.
We have sourced our European mortality and population data from databases published by Eurostat. There are strict criteria data must meet to be included in this database so analysing data from the source provides us with the best opportunity to be as comparable as possible. This does mean we are reliant on the availability of data that has been submitted to Eurostat by participating countries. Unfortunately, data from Germany are only available as total death counts for the whole country and are not broken down by age group, we therefore cannot include Germany in most of our analyses. More information about the data used in this article can be found in the Data sources and quality section.
Despite the UK having similar numbers of COVID-19 related deaths in the spring and at the end of 2020 and early 2021, all-cause excess mortality was greater in the spring than in the winter of 2020 to 2021. As more people generally die in the winter, some of those who died from COVID-19 during the winter months may have otherwise died during this period from other causes such as seasonal influenza. However, there was still a peak of 42.0% by 8 January 2021 indicating a substantial excess mortality rate at the start of January 2021.
Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) are the number of deaths observed per 100,000 people, standardised to control for differences in population size and age-structure between places and time points.
Relative age-standardised mortality rates (rASMRs) are measures of excess mortality. They are expressed as the percentage change per week in 2020 from the average expected age-standardised mortality rate in 2015 to 2019. rASMRs are calculated by:
subtracting the weekly 2015 to 2019 mean ASMR from the weekly 2020 ASMR
dividing by mean annual cumulative ASMR for 2015 to 2019
which in turn is divided by 52, the number of weeks in an average year
The resulting figure is a percentage change in the 2020 mortality rate, from what would have been expected in each week based upon the five-year average mortality rate in 2015 to 2019.
A negative value indicates a weekly 2020 ASMR below what is expected given the five-year average. In contrast, a positive value indicates a weekly ASMR above the five-year average.
Figure 1a shows rASMRs for all countries with data available, with the UK and central and eastern countries highlighted. Figure 1b shows rASMRs for 15 selected European countries with the highest cumulative excess mortality (relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates, rcASMRs) by the end of 2020. These are presented for all ages and those aged under 65 years.
When looking at the excess mortality at nation state level for total persons all ages, during the spring of 2020, Spain had the highest peak rASMR at 142.9%, followed by the UK at 101.5% and Belgium at 96.5%.
In the autumn and early winter of 2020 (week ending 18 September onwards) western European countries overall had lower levels of excess mortality while countries in central and eastern Europe had higher peaks in rASMRs. For example, in autumn, Bulgaria had the highest rASMR at 112.3% in week ending 27 November, followed by Poland (104.6%) and Czechia (96.7%) in week ending 6 November.
Looking at deaths of people aged under 65 years, the UK had the highest peak rASMR during the spring out of all European countries where data were available (62.7%, week ending 24 April). Spain had the second highest spring peak at 49.1% in week ending 26 March.
During the autumn Bulgaria suffered the highest weekly rASMR for those aged under 65 years (108.5%) for the whole of Europe, during the week ending 27 November. Poland's peak rASMR for those aged under 65 years (59.6%) occurred during the week ending 6 November.

Figure 1c shows rASMRs for 15 selected major European cities with the highest cumulative excess mortality rate (rcASMRs) by the end of 2020 for which data are available.
Of the selected major European cities, the highest relative excess mortality was observed in Madrid where it reached a peak of 452.0% in the week ending 27 March 2020. Barcelona peaked at 266.0% in the week ending 3 April 2020.
In the UK, Birmingham was the British city with the highest peak excess mortality (250.9%, week ending 17 April), followed by London (228.4% week ending 17 April) and Manchester (198.6%, week ending 17 April). Meanwhile Brussels peaked at 210.7% in week ending 10 April.
During the autumn and early winter of 2020, the highest peaks were observed in Sofia (112.5%, week ending 20 November) and Warsaw (103.8% week ending 13 November). Overall, the peak rASMRs observed in central and eastern European countries in the autumn months were not as high as those observed in western European countries during the spring months of 2020.

From the beginning of 2020 to week ending 21 February 2021, rASMRs fell within normal historical ranges for each European country. From week ending 28 February, mortality rates began to increase significantly in the province of Lodi, in the Lombardy region of Northern Italy as a result of an outbreak of COVID-19. In turn, the rASMR in Lodi province deviated away from zero (the average) to a maximum value of 447.2% in week ending 13 March. This was the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe.
Figure 2 shows a map of rASMRs at local authority level (NUTS3 level, which is a regional level of geography usually constituting one or two local government areas or municipalities). The map depicts the spread of the impacts of the pandemic across Europe in the spring months, starting in Lodi in northern Italy, through the relative low excess mortality for most countries during the summer months and then in the autumn the high levels of excess mortality in eastern Europe.

At the regional level, rASMRs throughout the first half of 2020 varied both between and within countries. rASMRs at the NUTS3 region level have much larger variation than those at the national level because of smaller numbers of deaths involved, as well as specific areas within each country being more affected than others.
The highest recorded rASMR was 841.7% in the Northern Italian city of Bergamo in week ending 20 March 2020. Table 1 lists the twenty NUTS3 regions with the highest recorded rASMR values in the spring months of 2020. The 10 highest regional rASMRs were all in Central Spain and Northern Italy. At the peak of their respective epidemics, the following had the second, third and fourth highest rASMRs respectively: Cremona (Italy, 608.4%, week ending 20 March), Segovia (Spain, 593.8%, week ending 27 March), Brescia (Spain, 472.1%, week ending 27 March).

Among the 20 regions with the highest peaks were four areas of the UK, of which three are in London and one in Essex, South East England.
During the autumn and early winter 2020 (week ending 18 September onwards) the 20 NUTS3 regions with the highest rASMRs were located within Poland, Greece, Bulgaria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and France. Tarnowski in Poland recorded the highest rASMR of 206.1% in the week ending 6 November. The nations with NUTS3 regions that experienced the highest rASMR values during the spring as shown in Table 1 were not represented in the 20 NUTS3 regions with the highest rASMRS values in the autumn to early winter period (see Table 2). Bulgaria's peak was during the week ending 4 December, later than Poland's peak week nearly a month earlier, ending 8 November.
Despite weekly peak rASMR values reaching 206.1%, the rASMR values during autumn and early winter were significantly lower than the extremes recorded in Northern Italy, Spain and the UK during the spring. Table 1 highlights that Bergamo had an rASMR of 841.7% during the week ending 20 March.

From the week ending 29 May, most of the western European nations that had experienced extremely high weekly excess mortality earlier in the spring returned to normal levels of weekly mortality. Throughout June, July and August most of Europe experienced weekly mortality that fluctuated around the five-year average; often below average mortality was recorded.
There were exceptions to this within four countries with short-lived weekly peaks experienced during the summer.
Portugal experienced its highest weekly peak rASMR (31.8%) in the week ending 17 July.  Belgium experienced a peak in rASMRs (42.1%) in the week ending 14 August; Belgium's weekly all-cause mortality then returned to the five-year average until rising sharply again in late October.
From the week ending 2 October, Czechia and Poland's excess mortality increased sharply. This rapid rise in excess mortality was followed a week later by steep increases across much of Eastern and Central Europe, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Switzerland and Austria. Belgium, a geographical outlier during this Autumn period, also experienced a third significant peak with an rASMR of 72.1% in week ending 6 November. Italy's weekly rASMR values were also increasing up to the week ending 30 October. Unfortunately this was the most recent week for which Italian death counts were available when our downloads from the Eurostat website were undertaken in early February 2021.
Poland's rASMR (104.6%) peaked in the week ending 8 November, as did Czechia's rASMR (96.7%). Bulgaria experienced the highest peak rASMR (112.3%) of the autumn period during the week ending 27 November.
Spain (28.0%), France (27.8%), the UK (26.6%) and the Netherlands (24.2%), also experienced a period of higher-than-average excess mortality in November and December 2020. In Greece the highest peak in weekly rASMRs during 2020 (32.2%) was recorded in the week ending 27 November. However, none of these countries experienced excess mortality on the scale of the central and eastern European nations, which had largely been unscathed by the spring-time wave that affected large parts of western and northern Europe to such an extreme extent.
During the spring of 2020, comparing each of the four nations of the UK separately shows us that England had the highest peak relative age-standardised mortality rate (rASMR) of the four nations of 108.4% during Week 16 (ending 17 April). This is followed by Scotland with a peak rASMR of 73.0% during Week 15 (ending 10 April), then Wales with a peak rASMR of 68.1% during Week 16. Comparatively, Northern Ireland experienced the lowest peak rASMR of the four nations of 53.4% during week 17 (ending 24 April) (Figure 3).
During the summer and early autumn weeks, the weekly rASMRs for the UK's constituent countries returned to the five-year average values with the usual week-to-week fluctuations.
From November and through December 2020 the UK and its four constituent countries experienced increasing weekly volatility in rASMRs. Peak values occurred in January 2021 with Wales recording the highest peak (54.5%, week ending 8 January 2021) followed by England (45.0%, week ending 29 January 2021) and then UK (42.0%, week ending 8 January 2021). Scotland’s peak rASMR (31.0%) occurred in the week ending 8 January 2021. The peak excess mortality in Northern Ireland (40.3%) was also recorded in the week ending 8 January 2021. Scotland’s rASMR values were predominantly lower than England, Wales and the UK weekly values during this period. By the week ending 12 February 2021, all UK nations were experiencing rapidly declining excess mortality, with Wales entering below average levels of mortality at negative 3.1% (fewer deaths than the five-year average for the same time period 
It is important to note that weeks with bank holidays could be affected because of the registration basis of data. For example, dips in registration between Weeks 52 (ending 25 December) and 53 (ending 1 January 2021) are likely because of the presence of bank holidays and fewer days available for deaths to be registered.
The peak rASMR during winter 2021 for the four UK capital cities and a small selection of other major cities is presented in Table 3. Cardiff (97.0%) experienced the highest peak in the week ending 22 January. Edinburgh's (73.5%) highest weekly rASMR occurred in the week ending 12 February. Glasgow (34.2%) had the lowest peak of the selected cities in the week ending 8 January.

During winter 2021 up to the week ending 12 February, it has been possible to calculate rASMRs for all UK NUTS3 geographies. The 20 NUTS3 areas with the highest peak rASMRs are listed in Table 4. All areas are located in London, South East, South West and the East of England with the exception of Shropshire and Dudley.
This section uses relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates (rcASMRs) to measure cumulative excess mortality relative to the 2015 to 2019 average annual mortality rates.
Comparing the cumulative ASMR for a point in 2020 with the average cumulative ASMR to the same point in 2015 to 2019 shows whether age-standardised mortality for 2020 has been above or below average up to that point. The rcASMR expresses this difference as a percentage of the average age-standardised mortality rate for full years 2015 to 2019.
A zero value for rcASMR indicates that age-standardised mortality for the year to date has been equal to the average. A positive value indicates worse than average mortality, and a negative value indicates better than average mortality.
If a country or area has an rcASMR of 10%, then the year-to-date mortality rate in 2020 compared with the five-year average is 10% higher than the equivalent 52 weeks' worth of mortality over the previous five years.
The rcASMR can increase or decrease over time. An increase in rcASMR corresponds to a period when age-standardised mortality has been above the 2015 to 2019 average, and a decrease in rcASMR corresponds to a period when mortality has been below the average.
By using an age-standardised rate-based measure of cumulative excess mortality, we are accounting for differences in both the age structures and seasonal mortality patterns of countries analysed.
Measures of cumulative mortality evaluate the total extent of mortality from one time point to another. In this article week 1 2020 (week ending 3 January 2020) is used as a start point and week 53 2020 (week ending 1 January 2021) is used as the end point.
In our last article we were only able to report up to 8 May 2020 (Week 19) to include Italy and Czechia, and up to 29 May 2020 (week 22) to include most other countries. In this article, we show rcASMRs at the mid-point of the year, Week 26 (ending 26 June 2020), then at Week 51 (ending 18 December 2020), where 26 out of 35 countries have reported data (including the four constituent countries of the UK). This is because of the varying speed at which countries are able to provide all-cause mortality data to Eurostat. Notably, at the time of data extraction (4 February 2021) Italy had only provided data up until 30 October 2020 (Week 44).
Table 5 shows that by the mid-point of the year -- Week 26 (ending 26 June) 2020 -- England had the highest rcASMR of the countries where data were available. In order of magnitude, this was followed by the UK, Spain, Scotland, and Belgium. At this mid-year point some countries experienced below average levels of mortality suggesting that despite the COVID-19 pandemic they were observing below average levels of mortality, possibly because of low levels of transmission in these countries at this point.
By week ending 18 December (Week 51), the optimal week for data availability and completeness for the year, Poland had the highest rcASMR at 11.6%. By contrast, by 26 June Poland had an rcASMR of negative 2.3%, indicating that this rapid increase in rcASMR was driven entirely by excess mortality in the second half of the year. The impact of the pandemic and subsequent levels of excess mortality was widespread in Poland, leading to high cumulative levels for the country at the end of the year rather than one area experiencing particularly high excess mortality.
Spain remained consistently at the higher end of rcASMRs for Europe with an rcASMR of 10.6% by 18 December (Week 51).
For the UK the rcASMR increased by a relatively small amount from Week 26 to Week 51 (6.7% to 7.2%), so remained fairly constant through the majority of the second half of the year. This is reflecting average to below average levels of mortality in the UK throughout the summer months followed by moderate excess mortality in the autumn and winter months.
Negative rcASMRs indicate an overall improvement in mortality over time, whilst positive values indicate a worsening level of mortality. We recorded seven countries with negative rcASMR values by 18 December 2020 (Week 51) namely Iceland, Norway, Cyprus, Denmark, Latvia, Finland and Estonia. Iceland had the lowest rcASMR at the end of 2020 with an rcASMR of negative 6.2%. These countries saw overall mortality rate improvement throughout 2020 compared with the previous five years despite the pandemic.
Figures 4a and 4b show the trend in rcASMR over the year for selected countries. From Weeks 1 to 8 2020, most countries saw improving mortality rates compared with the previous five years. For countries with the most prevalent outbreaks of COVID-19 during the spring, cumulative mortality improvement accrued during the first few months of 2020 was offset by rapidly worsening mortality. By the mid-point of the year (Week 26, ending 26 June 2020) Western European countries saw the highest cumulative measures of excess mortality (rcASMRs), the highest being England (7.3%), Spain (5.9%), Scotland (5.3%), Belgium (3.5%). In contrast to many western European countries, most eastern European countries saw an overall decline in mortality rates by this mid-point of the year.
Through the summer months, most countries saw a decline in excess mortality rates, either keeping rcASMRs at a constant level or decreasing if there were below average levels of mortality. However, in the autumn and winter months, eastern European countries in particular, but Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands too, saw increasing levels of excess mortality. For Poland, Bulgaria, and Czechia particularly the excess mortality rates later in the year accounted for large rises in cumulative excess mortality, ending the year with morality rates more than 8% higher than the five-year average.

Table 6 shows rcASMRs by Week 51, split into two age-groups: 0 to 64 years and 65 years and over. For ages 0 to 64, Table 4 shows that Bulgaria had the highest rcASMR by 18 December (Week 51) at 12.3%. This was followed by England (8.7%), Scotland (7.7%), Wales (5.0%) and Northern Ireland (4.1%). This means that the UK and its constituent countries had considerably higher excess mortality in the younger age groups than most other European countries by week ending 18 December 2020 (Week 51).
For the aged 65 years and over age group, Poland had the highest rcASMR by 18 December (week 51) at 14.5%. For this age group the UK and its constituent countries have a relatively lower rcASMR compared with other European countries.
Looking at major cities, by the week ending 26 June (Week 26) Madrid was the major city with the highest level of cumulative excess mortality rates (27.7%), followed by Barcelona (16.0%), Amsterdam (15.7%), Birmingham (14.9%) and London (14.3%). By 18 December 2020 (Week 51), Madrid was the major city with the highest cumulative excess mortality rate at 29.5%, this was followed by Barcelona (21.9%), Brussels (21.0%) and Birmingham (17.9 %).
Figure 4b shows the trend in rcASMRs over the year for selected major cities for all ages, and those age 0 to 64 years, and 65 years and over.
Despite eastern European countries experiencing high levels of excess mortality during the autumn period pushing cumulative measures of excess mortality to high levels by the end of the year, the rcASMRs for major cities in these countries were not higher than those for major cities in western Europe. For example, the rcASMR for Sofia was 8.5% by 18 December (Week 51) and 6.8% for Warsaw.

This article presents provisional analysis of European all-cause mortality patterns during 2020 and the first 6 weeks of 2021 for the UK. Weekly deaths data are examined for 34 European countries where official data was available by 4 February 2021 and compares measures from week ending 3 January 2020 (Week 1) to week ending 1 January 2021 (Week 53). Comparisons have been made for local areas (NUTS3 areas that are approximately local authority district or equivalent) as well as nationally for most of the countries included.
We use weekly all-cause death registration data published by Eurostat from contributing nations of the European Union and European Free Trade Association. There are clear criteria set out by Eurostat for data to be submitted to their database, based on official recording of deaths occurring in all settings, to maximise comparability.
For the UK we use Office for National Statistics (ONS) data for England and Wales, National Records Scotland (NRS) data for Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) data for Northern Ireland.
Analysis of all-cause mortality allows us to examine the impact of the pandemic not only from deaths due to COVID-19 but also excess deaths that have occurred as a result of the wider impacts of the virus on healthcare systems and society. Given the widely differing practices in recording and reporting deaths relating to COVID-19 it is not possible at this time to conduct accurate international comparisons of deaths involving COVID-19 specifically.
This article examines 2020 mortality patterns set against patterns observed during the preceding five years (2015 to 2019). The difference between the current period and a past average is often referred to as ""excess mortality"". This article is not a direct comparison of COVID-19 deaths or epidemic curves.
In this article we focus on two main measures of excess mortality: relative age-standardised mortality rates (rASMRs) and relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates (rcASMRs). Each measure has strengths and limitations when comparing populations between geographical areas. Broadly, these measures aim to control for non-modifiable population characteristics such as the age and size of differing populations so that like-for-like comparisons can be made between countries and regions. See the Glossary for definitions of each of these terms.
For assessing weekly measures of excess mortality, rASMRs are the best measure to show you periods where mortality rates were higher than average, the same as the five-year average or below average, they allow for identification of peaks in excess mortality.
rcASMRs are the best measure for for assessing the cumulation of excess mortality over the course of the year. They are calculated weekly and the value at the end of the shows how much above or below the mortality rate is compared with the five-year average.
Because of the established system of reporting weekly mortality events in the UK, we submit weekly death counts to Eurostat based on date of death registration rather than actual date of death (date of occurrence). Death registration counts in any given week represent between 50% and 60% of deaths that occurred in that seven-day period. Extensive analysis by ONS on predicting total weekly death occurrences has shown that by three weeks after date of occurrence, approximately 95% of occurrences will be registered. The remaining 5% may be delayed by one year or more due to the length of time before a Coroner's hearing and subsequent report is finalised and the cause of death is registered.
Therefore, for us to submit weekly deaths by date of occurrence on behalf of the UK there would need to be at least a three-week delay in the reporting of total deaths. This is because of the delay between death occurrence and death registration. Please see our recent blog Counting deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) and article Impact of registration delays on mortality statistics in England and Wales: 2018 about registration delays.
Eurostat report that the following countries report by date of occurrence: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Montenegro, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Switzerland, Serbia, Albania and Georgia. Data referring to recent weeks may be under-reporting the actual number of deaths and they are likely to be revised. 
The following countries report by date of registration: UK and Armenia.
We refer to weeks starting on a Saturday and ending on a Friday, as is standard for the ONS weekly reporting of deaths. The rest of Europe report weeks starting on Monday and ending on Sunday; therefore, these dates are a guide rather than exact for all countries. This is also the case for weekly deaths for Scotland.
Eurostat assign some deaths for some nations, for example Sweden, Hungary and Latvia, to a ""Week 99"" when the nation supplying the death numbers cannot confirm the date of occurrence. These deaths are omitted from our analyses, which may reflect missing data from unknown weeks throughout the year.
This means that any comparison of weekly deaths between the UK and its hierarchy of Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), with other European countries should, therefore, be subject to caveats in relation to the temporal comparability for any given week. Patterns of total deaths by date of registration broadly follow those of deaths by date of occurrence but are affected by public holidays when registry offices are closed.
The most recent statistical week in 2020 for which death counts were available on the Eurostat website as of 4 February 2021 are listed in Table 7.
Notably the Republic of Ireland has not submitted any data to the Eurostat mortality database, so we are unable to report any measure of excess mortality for this country.

As statistical measures, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs), relative ASMRs (rASMRs), and relative cumulative ASMRs (rcASMRs) all aim to reduce bias, allowing for comparisons between populations in differing geographical areas to be made. Each measure has revealed something different about the patterns of all-cause mortality during 2020 and 2021 so far. Presentation of age-standardised mortality rates shows us how these vary by seasons within countries and how they vary in size between countries.
It is important to keep in mind that countries and regions with smaller populations are subject to great fluctuations and variations in relative measures of excess mortality. Small changes in the total number of deaths may be represented by large changes in relative excess mortality.
The measures we have reported on do not, however, offer conclusive explanations for the reasons behind the patterns observed. Nonetheless, our measures do offer insight into relative change in mortality levels.
There are other potential statistical measures that could be used to measure excess mortality, including p-scores. We have chosen to report on age-standardised mortality rate-based measures in this report to account for differing age structures of the populations of the countries included in our analyses. We include data for Germany in these tables but not in those for ASMRs, rASMRs and rcASMRs. Data broken down by sex or age is not available on the Eurostat database for Germany, so it is not possible to calculate age-standardised mortality rates.
All data analysed in this article is publicly available on the Eurostat website (European Union Statistics Office). We contribute weekly counts of death registrations from all causes of death on behalf of the UK. This is combining death registration data for England and Wales held by us as well as death registration data for Scotland from National Records Scotland and Northern Ireland from Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.
The metadata for the weekly mortality data can be found on the Eurostat website. Each national statistical institute in the European Union has been requested to provide mortality counts by week, sex, five-year age group and a geographical breakdown to NUTS3 level. Where these are not possible broader age groups or geographical areas are accepted.
Readily available international comparisons of COVID-19 mortality are of limited quality because of different reporting systems and definitions. National differences in testing and diagnosis make comparisons especially difficult, along with hospital versus non-hospital coverage. The distinction between numbers based on death certification and those depending on test results is reflected in the international differences in data availability and quality. As has been noted elsewhere in this article and by health statisticians across the globe ""excess mortality"" is the most robust international comparator for the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Eurostat Weekly Mortality Online Database has emerged since March 2020, containing the greatest granularity of total weekly mortality, both in demographic terms, quinary deaths by gender, and geographically with published deaths by nation state and sub-nationally at NUTS 1, 2 and 3 levels. Furthermore, participating European countries have supplied a back series of five years of weekly deaths (2015 to 2019 inclusive) at the national and sub-national levels, enabling the calculating of average deaths per week, an essential part of the calculation of excess mortality and cumulative excess mortality during the pandemic.
In this article, three measures for evaluating levels of mortality have been calculated. We have also calculated p-scores, a further measure of evaluating deviations from expected levels of mortality that users may wish to use.
Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) are used to allow comparisons between populations that may contain different overall population sizes and proportions of people of different ages. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise age-specific rates to a consistent population. The formula used is:

















































































































Where:
G is the group (defined by some combination of age and sex) for which we calculate the ASMR
i is the time interval for which we calculate the ASMR
x is age
s is sex
ESP(x,s) is the standard population for age x and sex s
D(x,s,i) is the number of deaths for age x and sex s in time interval i
E(x,s,i) is a measure of the exposure for age x and sex s in time interval i
Weekly estimates of person-years exposed has been calculated using known population estimates on January 1 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Between these dates, weekly population estimates have been calculated by means of linear interpolation. For example:
Writing P(x,s,w,y) for the population in week w of year y, we set P(x,s,1,y) equal to the population estimates at January 1 and calculate exposure by:



































































































We define cASMR, the cumulative ASMR, which is used in calculating relative ASMRs and relative cASMRs, as the sum of weekly ASMRs up to that point in the year; i.e.



































































Relative age-standardised mortality rates (rASMRs) are weekly measures of excess mortality using age-standardised mortality rates that are standardised to the 2013 European standard population.
Excess mortality for a particular week is defined as the difference between the ASMR for that week and average ASMR for that week in the five years from 2015 to 2019 inclusive. For Week 53 2020 we compared against Week 52 in the five-year average. This excess mortality is then expressed as a proportion of the five-year average ASMR for full years. The following formula is used:












































































































































Where:
rASMR(G,w,y) is relative age-standardised mortality rate in week w and year y
ASMR(G,w,y) is age-standardised mortality rate in week w and year y, as defined in 'Age-standardised mortality rates' section
























































 is mean age-standardised mortality in week w, averaged over years 2015-19




























































 is mean age-standardised mortality for the end of the year, averaged over the full years 2015-19
. Rather than absolute values of death counts, rcASMRs sum all age-standardised mortality rates between two time points. In this article, rcASMRs are calculated cumulatively from Week 1, 2020 until Week 52, 2020 and are relative to the 2015 to 2019 average cumulative age-standardised mortality rate for that time period. The following formula is used:








































































































































Where:
cASMR(G,w,y) is cumulative standardised mortality rate in week w and year y, as defined in 9.2.1


























































 is mean cumulative age-standardised mortality rate to week w, averaged over 2015-19




























































 is mean age-standardised mortality, averaged over the full years 2015-19
We omit Week 53 2020 from this calculation given the infrequency in the five-year average of a year with 53 weeks. This makes it difficult to draw meaningful comparisons for relative cumulative mortality at week 53 against the five-year average. Therefore, all statistics for rcASMRs in this article are reported up until Week 52.
P-scores are weekly measures of excess mortality. An article was published in June 2020 recommending the use of p-scores in evaluating excess mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Excess deaths are defined as the number of deaths registered in excess of the five-year average (2015 to 2019). To determine a p-score, the following formula is used:









































































































Where:
ρ is the p-score at time point t
(G i,2020) is the number of deaths for group G in time interval i in 2020.


















































 is the mean number of deaths for group G in time interval i in years 2015 to 2019 inclusive.
The formula for a p-score is similar to that for rASMR except that the p-score:
uses deaths rather than age-standardised mortality rates, so does not control for changes in the population; and
the denominator for p-scores is for the period rather than the full year.

Productivity estimates use the Labour Force Survey (LFS), among other sources. LFS responses are weighted to official 2018-based population projections on demographic trends that pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. In our Coronavirus and the impact on payroll employment article we analyse the population totals used in the LFS weighting process and state our intention to make adjustments. Rates published from the LFS remain robust; however, levels and changes in levels should be used with caution. Any adjustments are likely to lead to small upward revisions to productivity growth in 2020. 



Productivity represents the relationships between inputs and outputs in the production process. Productivity is defined as the ratio between outputs and inputs. Increasing productivity means greater efficiency in producing output of goods and services from labour, capital, materials, and any other necessary inputs. As a practical concept, productivity helps define both the scope for raising living standards and the competitiveness of an economy. Therefore productivity has an important role in formulating and assessing government policy.
The UK government’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began to affect the UK economy at the end of Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020. The data in this bulletin runs until Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020, when there was a tightening of restrictions and a second lockdown in many parts of the UK. 
Figure 1 shows how the different measures of productivity have grown in different time periods: before, during and after the 2008 economic downturn, and during 2020.
Output per hour grew by an average annual growth rate of 2.2% in the 10-year period prior to the 2008 economic downturn (1997 to 2007). During the downturn (2008 to 2009), output per hour fell by an average of 1.2%. In the subsequent nine years (2010 to 2019), output per hour growth was positive but lower than previously, instead growing by 0.4%. This phenomenon is widely known as the productivity puzzle. 
In 2020, output per hour has continued to grow at 0.4%, leaving it seemingly unaffected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. A change in the distribution of economic activity between industries is the primary reason we have not seen a similar drop to the 2008-09 downturn, see section 4 for more detailed analysis.
A similar pattern can be observed for output per worker prior to 2020. Output per hour and output per worker differ because of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, with the latter falling by 9.5%. This is largely because of the effects of furlough; for more detailed analysis, see Section 5. The average growth rate for multi-factor productivity (MFP) in the 10 years prior to the financial crisis was 1.7%. Multi-factor productivity reflects the growth in productivity that is not attributable to either changes in labour or capital inputs. As a result, pre-downturn MFP growth could be due to several factors, but can generally be thought of as improvements in how resources are used across and within individual companies. 
The economic downturn saw a 4.3% drop in MFP as companies adjusted to the situation, yet MFP growth has not returned to its previous level, increasing by 0.3% on a compound basis from 2010 to 2019. This lower growth rate has contributed to the productivity puzzle. 
MFP fell during 2020 by 0.1%, which is far less than during the 2008 downturn. As with labour productivity, this can be attributed to changes in the distribution of economic activity between industries. 
Public service productivity (PSP) growth in these two economic crises tells a different story. In the decade leading up to the economic downturn PSP saw low average growth whilst output per hour and MFP average growth was high. However, during the downturn from 2008 to 2009, PSP was largely unaffected in contrast to output per hour and MFP. This is because the impact of the crisis was not felt in public services, which remained open and functional during this period. Conversely, the coronavirus pandemic has had a larger impact on the public services than on the whole economy. During 2020, public services have been hit by the forced closure of schools and the cancellation of non-essential healthcare activities. This, combined with exceptionally high government spending on measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic, has resulted in large falls in output and increases in inputs, resulting in a record drop in PSP. 
Please consider that there are important differences between labour productivity, multi-factor productivity and public service productivity, as explained in this article. 
Productivity measures have been impacted more sharply by the coronavirus pandemic than they were by the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. Figure 2 shows how a range of productivity measures and related statistics were impacted immediately after the onset of the 2008 downturn and the 2020 downturn. 
Output per hour, multifactor productivity, public service productivity, COVID-19 vs 2008 economic downturn
Download the data
All three measures of productivity (labour productivity, multi-factor productivity, and public service productivity) declined in Quarter 1 (Jan to March) 2020, the first period from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. For output per hour (labour productivity) and multi-factor productivity (MFP), this decline continued into the second period, Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, before a sharp recovery in the third period, Quarter 3 (Jul to Sept) 2020. This trend in output per hour is caused by gross value added (GVA) falling more than hours worked in Quarter 2 2020 but recovering faster in Quarter 3 2020. The MFP trend could be due to several factors including businesses adapting to the new situation and the shifting distribution of industries that continued to produce during lockdown. It was also impacted by a fall in capital utilisation, which accounted for much of the fall in GVA, due to workers being furloughed or working from home instead of in offices. Some of these factors unwound in Quarter 3 leading to a strong rise in MFP. 
While public service productivity (PSP) recovered in Quarter 3 2020, it remained below its 2019 level unlike output per hour and MFP. This was principally caused by large increases in government spending on services such as healthcare during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as large falls in output in services such as healthcare and education because of school closures and the cancellation of non-emergency medical treatments. 
Output per hour and MFP both declined into Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 from the continuing effects and resulting restrictions on economic activity of the coronavirus pandemic. The output per hour decline was due to GVA recovering at a slower rate than total hours worked. The productivity of the labour force and, notably, capital utilisation provided positive contributions to GVA growth in this period. MFP, which makes up the residual between these elements and changes to GVA, was likely driven by further shifts between the economic activity of different industries in the economy. The changes seen in all these estimates is in contrast to the long and slow fall and recovery experienced following the economic downturn in 2008.
It is clear from Figure 2 that for PSP the immediate fall in productivity following the lockdowns to combat the coronavirus pandemic was much more severe than the corresponding decrease following the economic downturn in 2008. It was not until a year later in Quarter 1 2009 that there was a notable decrease in public service productivity. This was because there were no impacts to the provision of public services immediately following the economic downturn.
It is not yet clear what the long-term recovery of productivity will look like. In time, the impact of the economic crash caused by the coronavirus restrictions will become clearer.
One reason that output per hour growth has been surprisingly resilient in 2020 is a large positive allocation effect. Growth in whole economy output per hour can be decomposed into two components:
A direct contribution from each industry’s productivity growth – that is, organic productivity growth within an industry driven by an improvement in the performance of its firms, driven by technology, skills, efficiency, and so on.
An allocation effect - that is, changes in the mix of activities in the economy between firms or industries that have different levels of productivity - might be characterised by resources moving from low to high productivity industries (a positive allocation effect) or from high to low productivity industries (a negative allocation effect).
Government restrictions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) led some industries to close while others could remain open, leading to large shifts in the relative sizes of different industries. Figure 3 shows the industries with the largest changes (both positive and negative) in their share of hours worked in the economy between 2020 and 2019, and their productivity level in 2019. For this period these changes are larger than usual.

Industries that saw a fall in their relative share of hours worked tended to be lower productivity industries. Compared with a whole economy average productivity level of about £36.00 per hour worked in 2019, the food and beverage services industry (I56) was about 54% less productive. By contrast, industries with an increased share of hours worked tended to be high productivity industries. The legal and accounting (M69) and computer services (J62) industries had productivity levels of £41.40 and £38.20 per hour worked in 2019 respectively, 15% and 6% above the whole economy average. Other industries increasing in size, such as the human health and public administration industries, are not easily compared with the rest of the economy because of the way output is measured. 
As a result, the allocation effect was strongly positive in 2020 (Figure 4). This was particularly true in Quarter 2 (April to June) 2020 when the most stringent restrictions were in place and hence the largest changes in the share of hours worked within each industry was observed. The allocation effect was the largest on record in Quarter 2 2020. The size of the allocation effect receded in the second half of 2020 as industries began to reopen but remained strongly positive in Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 2020 compared to the same quarters of 2019. 
Figure 4 has alternative measures of the allocation effect, which are based on different degrees of industry decomposition. More detailed industry breakdowns allow for a larger allocation effect since changes between more detailed industries can be observed, although that is not always the case. For instance, the most aggregated breakdown in Figure 4 groups all non-financial market services together, which encompasses a wide range of economic activities. The more detailed sectional and divisional breakdowns split up non-financial market services into more parts. We have introduced divisional contributions to productivity growth, including allocation effect, in our divisional productivity dataset with this release. 
The 2008 to 2009 economic downturn did not have a similarly large allocation effect since the share of hours worked in each industry did not shift as dramatically as in 2020. The decline in hours worked in 2008 was broad-based and shallow, leading to little change in the relative size of industries. 
The period from the start of 2005 to the end of 2006 also had higher than usual allocation effects. This is primarily because of shifts between services industries. The real estate industry (a high productivity industry because of the inclusion of imputed rental in the output measure) and the computer services industry (a high productivity industry) expanded rapidly at this time. By contrast the retail and motor trades industries (relatively low productivity industries) saw a declining hours share in 2005 and 2006. 
Figure 5 shows output per hour growth with and without accounting for the allocation effect (measured with different industry breakdowns). The series without the allocation effect measure only the direct contribution to productivity growth, that is productivity growth within industries, holding the relative size of industries constant. If the economy had the same structure as in 1997, whole economy output per hour would be around 5% to 10% lower than it actually is today. This is largely because of changes in size between more detailed industries (within the non-financial market services sector), rather than higher-level changes (such as between manufacturing and services). 
Along with changes at the whole-economy level, the coronavirus pandemic has led to interesting changes within industries. The wholesale, retail and motor trades industry (SIC07 section G) has seen a large divergence between growth in gross value added (GVA) and in hours worked which may be linked to structural changes within the industry. 
In the second half of 2020, output per hour in the wholesale and retail industry saw a large increase, caused by the slow recovery in hours combined with a strong recovery in gross value added (GVA). 
In Quarter 2 (Apr to Jun) 2020, GVA and hours worked both fell more than 20%, because restrictions to reduce the spread of coronavirus required physical outlets to close. When restrictions were eased in Quarter 3 (Jul to Sep) 2020, GVA recovered to 2019 levels, while hours worked remained below 2019 levels. In Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020, GVA remained relatively stable while hours worked partially recovered to 7% below the 2019 average. 
A shift from physical outlets to online retail, which is likely to be less labour-intensive, could explain why hours worked remained low even though GVA recovered. This trend towards e-commerce has been happening for some time, evidenced by the steady growth in GVA alongside little growth in hours worked in the industry since 2012. 
Another possibility is from economies of scale – the cost advantages enterprises gain from their scale of operation. The shops that were allowed to stay open, such as supermarkets, tend to be larger than average. If larger shops are on average more productive, the re-weighting of the industry towards larger shops would increase average productivity.
Growth in output per hour from both these reasons would be picked up multi-factor productivity (MFP). When we decompose the movements of productivity growth in each quarter, we discover the measured inputs (labour and capital) do not display large enough changes to explain the 2020 increase in labour productivity in the industry. When compared to 2019, the quality of the workforce (labour composition) and the availability of capital per hour worked (capital deepening) increased respectively by 1.6 and 1 percent, against an MFP growth of 4.6 percent. 
It is likely the shift from low-productivity physical shops to high-productivity online retail led to an allocation effect within the industry of wholesale and retail. Nonetheless, this could be just part of the explanation for the higher MFP growth, and there could be other factors we have not considered.
Our preferred measure of productivity is output per hour growth compared with the same quarter in the previous year, which has fallen by 0.7%. Quarter-on-year comparisons provide a more reliable indicator of longer-term productivity trends compared with quarter-on-quarter comparisons, which are impacted by short-run volatility and transition costs. 
Output per hour and output per worker previously had similar growth rates, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS, otherwise known as furlough) has caused a divergence. To qualify for furlough, workers must work zero or reduced hours. This means that their total hours worked will fall, but they are still counted as workers, so the number of workers does not fall. The way that labour productivity is measured means that if total hours worked falls, but the number of workers does not, growth in output per hour will be higher than growth in output per worker. 
The CJRS has allowed firms to furlough their workers instead of making them redundant, leading to a 1.6% decrease in employment. This is comparatively small compared with the 6.8% decrease in the total number of hours worked. The 5.2 percentage point difference between total hours worked and employment explains the disparity between the two productivity measures. Alongside these changes, we have seen gross value added (GVA) fall by 7.5% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Output per hour fell by 0.7% compared with the same quarter a year ago, whereas output per worker fell by 5.9% over the same period. 
We continue to compile Experimental Statistics to demonstrate the effect of the government’s furlough scheme on labour productivity using Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employment data, equivalent to jobs. Figure 8 shows labour productivity (measured by output per job) including and excluding furlough workers. 
In Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020, output per job excluding furloughed workers decreased by 1.0% when compared with the previous quarter. When furloughed workers are included, we see a rise of 1.5% in output per job over the same period. 
The level of output per job was 11.7% higher in Quarter 4 2020 when furloughed workers are excluded, similar to the 14.6% difference in Quarter 3 (July to Sep) 2020. This continues to indicate that the furlough scheme is predominately being used in industries with lower levels of productivity. 
In Quarter 4 2020, the UK experienced a tightening of restrictions and a second national lockdown. Sectors such as Government Services and Transportation and Storage experienced a growth in output per job (both when including and excluding furloughed workers) when compared with the previous quarter, whereas the Accommodation and Food Services Sectors experienced some of the largest declines. 
Estimates of multi-factor productivity (MFP) provide a more nuanced view, controlling for the changes in the various inputs used to create economic output and how these inputs are combined to deliver output. These inputs include changes to capital services (such as machinery and software), changes to the composition of the labour market (for example, the number of workers with university degrees) and changes to labour input in terms of hours worked. This is explained in a simple guide to multi-factor productivity. MFP only covers the market sector and excludes the public sector and other similar parts of the economy.
The fall in hours worked in the market sector in 2020 contributed 9 percentage points towards the 11.1% decrease in market sector GVA. This impact is shown in Figure 9. Further to this, many existing capital assets, including buildings and machinery and equipment, stood idle during the lockdowns used to combat the pandemic in 2020. When accounting for how much capital was utilised in the period, capital services contributed 3.8 percentage points to the fall in GVA in the period. This left the effect of changes to MFP providing a small negative contribution throughout the year. 
Labour composition, which reflects the mix of skills held by workers employed in economic production in the economy, provided a driver to output growth. This was due to many productive workers being able to continue working throughout the pandemic while their less skilled counterparts were furloughed or otherwise unable to work. This pulled up the average labour composition measure by 2.9% in 2020.
The shift seen in labour composition in 2020 can be broken down into hours worked in the market sector by education levels in figure 10. When looking at these changes across the four quarters it is clear that less educated workers saw the largest dips in their hours in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, yet the recovery throughout the rest of the year was in line with more educated workers.
These shifts contributed to a 2.3% increase in labour composition in Quarter 2 2020, which was sustained for the second half of the year. 
Alongside the annual estimate of public service productivity (1997 to 2018), which is badged as a National Statistic, and other measures of productivity, we also publish quarterly experimental measures of total public service productivity. The quarterly series offers a timelier measure, as the annual series has a significant time lag, but does not include changes to quality adjustments , which are only made annually. Inputs and output of experimental quarterly estimates of productivity are indirectly seasonally adjusted. 
Compared with the same quarter in the previous year, public service productivity fell by 13.0% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020, as shown in Figure 11. This was largely due to a 14.1% increase in public service inputs, which is the highest increase in quarterly inputs on record. Public service outputs fell 0.7% compared with the same quarter in the previous year, meaning that in Quarter 2020 the volume of public service output had nearly returned to the level it was at before the pandemic. 
The increase in total inputs is largely caused by large increases in government expenditure on healthcare since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This increase reflects expenditure on the Test and Trace scheme and the continued procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE). 
Figure 12 compares the current quarter with the previous quarter. In Quarter 4 2020, productivity grew by 4.7% when compared with Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2020. 
As discussed previously, there has been a relatively small fall in public service output compared to the previous year. However, following a record quarterly fall of 18.0% in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic public service outputs recorded strong quarterly growth of 15.7% and 6.5% in Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 2020 respectively. This growth is largely due to improving activities data in healthcare and education. However, it is not clear if output growth in this quarter has been dampened by the various lockdowns that took place across the devolved nations of the UK in the autumn and winter of 2020.
The growth in healthcare activity reflects the continued recovery in areas such as elective surgery and GP appointments. In other areas such as dental and ophthalmic surgery, the volume of activity remains subdued due to reduced patient capacity in response to coronavirus safety protocols. 
Adjustments, informed by the available in-year spending data for Test and Trace, have been added to our indices from Quarter 2 2020 for the first time to account for this new service. As discussed in our healthcare blog, we are undertaking further work to capture activities such as the Test and Trace scheme and vaccine distribution in our output volumes. 
Activity volumes in education increased as schools re-opened from September 2020, with schools remaining open throughout the various national lockdowns up to December 2020 in all four parts of the UK. Although the attendance rate in this period was lower than normal, it was much higher than during the first period of national lockdown from March to July 2020. As such, the activity volumes in education were lower in Quarter 4 2020 than in 2019, but higher than they were in the previous quarters affected by coronavirus restrictions. 
Changes in how we measure education activity volumes have improved the consistency of the measurement of remote learning during 2020. They have reduced our estimate of the amount of education provided by remote learning during the coronavirus pandemic. As such, the impact of school closures during the first national lockdown was higher than first estimated. Detailed information on our approach to measuring education output during the coronavirus pandemic can be found in our recent article.
In this release we can show for the first time an estimate of public service productivity for 2020 as a whole (Figure 13) 
The strong fall in the quarterly estimates since the beginning of the pandemic led to a large decrease in our estimate for annual public service productivity in 2020. As shown in Figure 13, Public service productivity is estimated to fall by 15.4% in 2020 compared with 2019. 
More accurate estimates at an annual level for 2020 will be published in 2023 in our annual public service productivity estimate, which is badged as a National Statistic. This annual estimate will include quality adjustment factors to better reflect the value users have drawn from the public services delivered. Despite the changes in methodology and data between the experimental and annual articles, our estimates for annual public service productivity are likely to continue to fall in 2020. Indeed, the annual change observed in the quality adjustments has never reached a level equivalent to the fall shown in Figure 13. This suggests that it is extremely unlikely that the changes in quality will fully compensate for this fall. 
Due to the lack of the availability of some data during the coronavirus pandemic, it is possible that there will be further revisions to our estimates for recent quarters, such as the incorporation of new unit costs and activities data for the NHS Test and Trace service. The way we seasonally adjust public service inputs and outputs is also being reviewed as we get a clearer picture of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on public services. As such, we are constantly working with our data suppliers to ensure the provision of future data and will document any impact that revision might have on our estimates. 
Unit labour costs (ULCs) capture the costs of labour incurred in the production of a single unit of economic output. They reflect the relationship between the cost of labour and the value of the corresponding output. If increases in labour costs are not reflected in the volume of output, meaning that ULCs increase, this can put upward pressure on the prices of goods and services. ULCs can therefore be viewed as an indicator of inflationary pressure as labour costs are the most important contributor to the costs of production. We produce nominal ULCs, which are expressed as a ratio between total labour costs per hour in current prices, and output per hour worked in constant prices. Wage subsidies such as the government’s furlough schemes are deducted from the total labour costs, meaning ULCs reflect the costs actually incurred by employers.
In Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020, ULCs increased by 7.2% compared with the same quarter in the previous year. The increase in ULCs was driven almost entirely by a 6.4% increase in labour costs per hour, and to a much lesser extent by a 0.7% decrease in output per hour. The last four quarters of volatility follows a period of stable ULCs growth, which has occurred since Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2016. Prior to this, ULCs growth had been volatile within a moderate range around zero.
We also publish nominal unit wage costs (UWCs), which are identical to ULCs except that they exclude employers’ pension contributions and employers’ social contributions, such as employers’ National Insurance payments. In this publication, for the first time, employment subsidies (including furlough payments) have been excluded from UWCs in the same way as for ULCs. This applies to both whole economy UWCs and manufacturing UWCs.
We are continuing to develop our Sectional Unit Labour Cost methodology, since we suspended their publication in April 2020. In doing so we are considering the relationship between unit labour costs and other statistics at ONS, including the Index of Labour Costs per Hour. We intend to publish more details in due course, and welcome user input to productivity@ons.gov.uk.

As the UK enters into a new Trade and Co-operation Agreement with the EU, the UK statistical system will continue to produce and publish our wide range of economic and social statistics and analysis. We are committed to continued alignment with the highest international statistical standards, enabling comparability both over time and internationally, and ensuring the general public, statistical users and decision makers have the data they need to be informed.
As the shape of the UK’s future statistical relationship with the EU becomes clearer over the coming period, the ONS is making preparations to assume responsibilities that as part of our membership of the EU, and during the transition period, were delegated to the statistical office of the EU, Eurostat. This includes responsibilities relating to international comparability of economic statistics, deciding what international statistical guidance to apply in the UK context and to provide further scrutiny of our statistics and sector classification decisions.
In applying international statistical standards and best practice to UK economic statistics, we will draw on the technical advice of experts in the UK and internationally, and our work will be underpinned by the UK’s well-established and robust framework for independent official statistics, set out in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007. Further information on our proposals will be made available early this year.
The ONS is publishing more data and analysis than ever before. We are constantly reviewing our publications based on your feedback to make sure that we continue to meet the needs of our users. As a result, we may temporarily reduce the detail in future productivity releases. Thank you for your continued support and we value your feedback. 
We have launched a stakeholder survey to gather feedback on how we can further develop and improve our productivity statistics. 
We are seeking the views of anyone who uses ONS productivity statistics for analysis, research, policy-making or other purposes. 
If you would like to give us your views, please respond here by Friday 30 April 2021. The survey should take around 10 minutes to complete. 
Any information you provide will be analysed with other responses and used anonymously to help us set the priorities for our development work.

More information on our headline estimates of the overall number of positive cases in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are available in our latest bulletin. It should be noted that the analysis on the characteristics and behaviours of those testing positive in this article is for a different time period than the headline figures presented in the most recent bulletin. The reference periods for the various analyses are clearly stated at the start of each section.
Further information on what the analysis covers is provided at the start of each section. More information about the methods used for our models is available in our methodology article.
This section provides modelled estimates on positivity rates by patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles for the UK. Previously we have reported this analysis for England grouped by those aged under 35 years and 35 years and above, which have shown different patterns of positivity in the past. This age split is now less meaningful since the overall estimate of the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) is very low.  The analysis presented in this article is not comparable to estimates in previous publications.
The models used to produce positivity rates for patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles include only swab test results from individuals aged 16 to 74 years. This analysis covers the time period between 21 September 2020 and 2 May 2021.
In the weeks prior to 2 May 2021, the percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) appears to have decreased in both patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles in the UK. This is after a peak in January 2021, which was more pronounced for patient-facing job roles than non-patient-facing job roles.

This section looks at how often individuals are reporting social contact (either socially distanced or physical contact) with other people outside their own household, regardless of whether they have tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19). We asked individuals how many people aged 17 years and under, 18 to 69 years, and 70 years and over, outside their household, they have had contact with up to seven days prior to each visit. ""Contact"" refers to either of the following:
socially distanced contact - direct contact with social distancing only
physical contact - physical contact, such as a handshake or personal care, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)
This analysis covers the time period between 13 July 2020 and 2 May 2021 in England, and 21 September 2020 and 2 May 2021 for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Further information on the schedule for school re-openings can be viewed for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Information on lockdown easing can be viewed for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
We have produced estimates that have been weighted to be representative of the total population in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Analysis includes all people taking part in the survey and we present contact analysis for school-age children (age two years to school Year 11) and adults (school Year 12 and above). We report the number of contacts in the following groups:
0 (no reported contact)
1 to 5 (reported contacts)
6 to 10 (reported contacts)
11 to 20 (reported contacts)
21 or more (reported contacts)
We present the proportion of school-age children reporting each category of socially distanced contact in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in Figure 2.
In England, the proportion of socially distanced contacts school-age children had with those aged under 70 years rose sharply in mid-March 2021, corresponding to schools re-opening in England, with a dip occurring in mid-April 2021 corresponding to the school Easter holidays. The number of contacts children had with people 70 years and above has also increased gradually since mid-January 2021.
In Wales, the proportion of socially distanced contacts school-age children had with those aged under 70 years rose throughout March and April 2021, corresponding to the re-opening of schools. A dip in the number of reported contacts occurred in mid-April corresponding with the school Easter holidays. The number of contacts children had with people over 70 years has also increased gradually since March 2021.
In Northern Ireland, the proportion of socially distanced contacts school-age children had with those aged under 70 years has been increasing since early March 2021. This corresponds with the full re-opening of schools.
In Scotland, the proportion of socially distanced contacts school-age children had with all age groups has been increasing since early March 2021. This corresponds to the phased re-opening of schools.
There is a consistent trend over time and across all nations with school-age children reporting to have more socially distanced contacts with those aged under 18 years than with those aged 18 to 69 years or over 70 years.

We present the proportion of adults reporting each category of socially distanced contact in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in Figure 3.
In England, the proportion of socially distanced contacts with all age groups for adults have been increasing throughout April 2021. 
In Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland the proportion of socially distanced contacts across all age groups for adults has been increasing since early March 2021. The rise in contact rates with people over 70 years has been less pronounced in Northern Ireland and Scotland.
There is a consistent trend over time and across all nations, with adults reporting more socially distanced contacts with those aged 18 to 69 years than with people under the age of 18 years or 70 years and over.

Among school-age children, the trends in physical contacts are very similar to socially distanced contact trends across the UK, with increases in contacts through March and April 2021 to 2 May 2021.
In school-age children in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of physical contacts follows a similar trend to the number of socially distanced contacts.  
There is a consistent trend over time, with school-age children reporting to have more physical contacts with those aged under 18 years than with those aged 18 to 69 years or 70 years and over.
Among adults, trends in physical contacts over time are very similar to socially distanced contact trends across the UK, with increases in contacts through March and April 2021, although the number of physical contacts was lower.
Adults in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland report to have had more physical contacts with those aged 18 to 69 years than with under 18s or over 70s. 
Additional information on the proportions of physical contacts by school-age children and adults can be found in the accompanying dataset.
Our findings appear consistent with what has been reported in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which examines the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain. The most recent Opinions and Lifestyle Survey bulletin reported that among adults in Great Britain, from 5 to 9 May 2021:
the proportion of adults meeting up indoors with someone not in their household, childcare or support bubble in the last seven days was 19% compared with 10% in the previous week (28 April to 3 May); this proportion had previously been relatively stable since the start of 2021
the proportion of adults meeting up outdoors with someone not in their household, childcare or support bubble was 57%, similar to 56% in the previous week; this proportion had increased quickly as related restrictions eased across Great Britain from late March 2021, prior to which it was 23% (17 to 21 March 2021)
The analysis in this section looks at each person who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) who had a strong positive test in the UK. The strength of the test is determined by how quickly the virus is detected, measured by a cycle threshold (Ct) value. The lower the Ct value, the higher the viral load and stronger the positive test. Positive results with a high Ct value can be seen in the early stages of infection when virus levels are rising, or late in the infection, when the risk of transmission is low.
Participants who only have positive tests with these high values are excluded from this analysis to exclude the possibility that symptoms are not identified because we pick up individuals very early or later on in their infection. You can find more information on Ct values in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.
This analysis considers individuals with any positive test (including repeated positive tests) that had a Ct value less than 30 between 1 December 2020 and 30 April 2021 in the UK. This analysis considers all symptoms reported at visits within 35 days of the first positive test of the episode, and at each visit we ask about symptoms in the last seven days. This includes symptoms reported even when there is a negative test within this timeframe or a positive test with a higher Ct value. For this article, we are presenting the percentage of people reporting symptoms by strong positive test for the whole of the UK, instead of separately by each UK nation. More details on this analysis can be found in Section 9.  
Individuals taking part in the survey were asked at each visit whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms1 in the seven days before they were tested and also separately whether they felt that they had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection in the last seven days.
In Figure 5 we have categorised reported symptoms into the following:
any: any specific self-reported symptom, including cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste, loss of smell, myalgia, fatigue, sore throat, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting
classic: cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste or loss of smell
gastrointestinal (GI): abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhoea
loss of taste or smell only
This analysis is based on all individuals who test positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test (Ct <30) and considers what percentage of these individuals reported symptoms within 35 days of the first positive test in the episode. ​
In April 2021, 53% (95% confidence interval: 45% to 60%) of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the UK reported symptoms. The confidence intervals are wider because of lower numbers of people testing positive in our survey during March and April 2021.

Figure 6 shows, the most commonly reported symptoms in the UK have consistently been cough, headache and fatigue.​ The least commonly reported symptoms have consistently been abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea or vomiting.
The prevalence of most symptoms appeared to increase between December 2020 and February 2021, but there is no clear trend since then.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections in the community in the UK Dataset | Released 20 May 2021 Characteristics of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. 


 
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust. Of particular note are:
Sarah Walker - University of Oxford, Nuffield Department for Medicine: Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology and Study Chief Investigator
Koen Pouwels - University of Oxford, Health Economics Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Population Health: Senior Researcher in Biostatistics and Health Economics
Thomas House - University of Manchester, Department of Mathematics: Reader in mathematical statistics
More information on measuring the data and its strengths and limitations is available in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey statistical bulletin.
Our methodology article provides further information around the survey design, how we process data and how data are analysed.
The analysis on the symptoms profile of strong positive cases in the UK considers individuals with any positive test (including repeated positive tests) that had a Ct value less than 30 between 1 December 2020 and 30 April 2021. Positive episodes are now being defined as ""a new positive test 90 days or more after an initial first positive test and following a previous negative test, or, if within 90 days, a subsequent positive test following four consecutive negative tests"", rather than using a 90-day threshold alone.
