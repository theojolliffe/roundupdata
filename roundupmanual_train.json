however, people\u2019s experiences varied depending on their characteristics.\u2028\nFemales, older people and those in rural areas tend to be more involved in local social and support networks than males, younger people and those in urban areas.\u2028\nFemales reported having stronger social connections and support links with their local communities than males; 73.6% of females, compared with 65.5% of males, felt that they would receive support from their local community if they needed help during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (Great Britain, May to August 2020).\u2028\nSocial network support tends to increase with age; 65.8% of people aged 65 to 74 years checked on their neighbours who might need help compared with 41.3% of those aged 16 to 24 years (Great Britain, May to July 2020).\u2028\nRural areas appear to have stronger community relations than urban areas, although some improvements in social capital in urban communities were observed; the percentage of people who believe that others in general can be trusted increased by 3.9 percentage points in urban areas between 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 in England.\u2028\nFollowing a period of narrowing, the gender gap in feeling safe when walking alone at night in one\u2019s local area increased again to levels seen from 2015 to 2016 through to 2018 to 2019; 69.5% of females reported feeling safe compared with 89.5% of males (England and Wales, 2020 to 2021).\n\nSocial capital by urban and rural area\nIn England in 2020 to 2021, larger percentages of people in rural areas reported talking regularly with their neighbours (81.8% compared with 72.4% of the urban population) and borrowing things or exchanging favours (44.1% compared with 35.6% of the urban population). These area-based differences were observed both in 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021, with no over-time changes for either of the areas.\nIn addition, between May and July 2020 in Great Britain, 63.8% of people in rural areas were checking on their neighbours who might need help, compared with 53.2% of those in urban areas. More people in rural areas, than in urban areas, also felt that they could rely on their local community for support (79.3% and 67.4%, respectively).\nIn March 2021 in the UK, 75.4% of people in rural areas agreed that people in their area are willing to help their neighbours (compared with 65.0% of those in urban areas).\nWhile people in rural areas appear to have stronger social network support than those in urban areas, our data show over-time improvements in the urban-rural gap in levels of trust and cooperative norms (see Figure 7). In England in 2020 to 2021, the gap in the sense of belonging to one\u2019s neighbourhood narrowed down from 11.1 percentage points (in 2019 to 2020) to 8.3 percentage points between those in rural and urban areas. At the same time, the gap in generalised trust levels decreased from 15.6 percentage points to 9.1 percentage points because of an increase in the percentage of urban people who think that people in general can be trusted. Finally, while the neighbourhood trust levels (percentage of people agreeing that most people in their neighbourhood can be trusted) fell sharply in both rural and urban areas between 2014 to 2015 and March 2021, they declined more in the rural communities. As a result, the urban-rural gap in neighbourhood trust also narrowed from 14.2 percentage points to 10.9 percentage points.\nIn urban areas, there was also a 2.8 percentage points increase (from 85.2% to 88.0%) in the percentage of males reporting feeling safe walking alone after dark in their local area in England and Wales between 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 (please note\u00a0the change in survey methodology between 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021, which might have affected the estimates). No change was seen in urban females' feelings of safety. In 2020 to 2021, females in urban areas continued to feel safe at a below average rate of 66.6% (compared with 69.5% of all females and 81.4% of females in rural areas) (see Figure 8). The gender gap in feelings of safety increased in both urban and rural areas since 2019 to 2020 and remained bigger in urban areas (21.5 percentage points) than in rural areas (14.6 percentage points) in 2020 to 2021.", "summary": "Rural areas report stronger social networks than urban areas\nAlmost two thirds (63.8%) of people in rural areas of Great Britain (GB) were checking in on their neighbours who might have needed help when coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were in place in May to July 2020.

The most common reason given was working from home being part of workers\u2019 normal routine (62%), suggesting they have adopted homeworking long-term. Some workers may have already done so before the coronavirus pandemic.\nHigh earners are more likely to hybrid work\nHybrid and homeworking increased by income bracket. More than a third (38%) of workers earning \u00a340,000 or more hybrid worked between 27 April and 8 May 2022, meaning they both worked from home and travelled to work in the latest week. Workers in this income group were the only ones for whom hybrid working was the most common working pattern. They were also more likely than other income groups to work from home exclusively.\nLower earners were less likely to report hybrid working.

In contrast, occupations with lower average earnings, such as gardeners, carpenters and mechanics, were less likely to be able to work from home.\nTravelling to work was the most common working pattern for all income group earning up to \u00a340,000, and was most common among the lowest paid individuals. 6 in 10 (62%) workers paid up to \u00a315,000 per year travelled to work exclusively.\nThe proportion of people who reported working from home exclusively was similar between age groups, with the highest proportion among those aged 16 to 29 years (16%), and the lowest proportion among those aged 70 years and over (10%).\nTravelling to work exclusively was the most common working schedule for those aged between 16 and 69 years, with more than half of workers aged 16 to 29 years and aged 50 to 69 years doing so.\nThree-quarters of home and hybrid workers reported improved work life balance\nMore than three-quarters (78%) of those who worked from home in some capacity said that being able to work from home gave them an improved work life balance in February 2022. Half reported it was quicker to complete work (52%) and that they had fewer distractions (53%). Almost half also reported improved well-being (47%).\nYounger workers aged 16 to 29 years were less likely than those aged 30 years and over to report experiencing fewer distractions when homeworking. Just under a third of those aged 16 to 29 years reported fewer distractions (32%), compared with more than half of those aged 30 to 49 years (56%) and those aged 50 to 69 years (60%).\nPrevious analysis from January 2022 found\u00a0almost half of homeworkers (46%) also reported seeing their spending decrease since working from home. While the majority of homeworkers reported an increase in their spending on utility bills (86%), half said they spent less on fuel and parking for commuting (50%), and two-fifths said their spending on commuting on public transport had reduced (40%).\nHowever, 8% of homeworkers reported no advantages.\nThe most common disadvantage experienced by homeworkers was difficulty in working with others, with 48% of homeworkers reporting this in February 2022. A little over a quarter also reported more distractions when working from home (26%). Nearly a third (31%) reported no disadvantages at all.\nThe most common safety measure workers said they wanted when they went into their place of work was ventilation, such as open windows, followed by enhanced cleaning procedures (69% and 66% of respondents, respectively).\nHomeworkers were also asked which days they worked from home between 27 April to 8 May 2022. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people with access to homeworking who were doing so on each weekday.\nMost information and communication businesses plan to use homeworking permanently\nOverall, the proportion of businesses reporting using or intending to include homeworking as a permanent business model increased slightly from 16% in autumn 2020 to 23% in early April 2022. This varied significantly by industry.\nMore than half (54%) of businesses in the information and communication industry said they were using, or intended to use, increased homeworking as part of a permanent business model in early April 2022. This was only the case for 3% of businesses in the accommodation and food services industry, and 5% of businesses in the construction industry, which are less adaptable to homeworking.\nIndustries that saw the largest increases in the proportion of businesses reporting that they use or would be using homeworking as a permanent business model between November 2020 and April 2022 included the:\ninformation and communication industry (23 percentage point increase)\neducation (private sector and higher education businesses only) industry (20 percentage point increase)\nprofessional and scientific activities industry (12 percentage point increase)\narts, entertainment and recreation industry (11 percentage point increase)\nThe most common reason for using or planning to use homeworking as part of a permanent business model (among businesses who reported this) was improved staff well-being (60%), followed by reduced overheads (43%) and increased productivity (41%).", "summary": "More than 8 in 10 pandemic home workers plan to hybrid work\nMore than 8 in 10 (84%) of pandemic home workers said they planned to carry out some form of hybrid working in the future, spending their working hours between their workplace and home.\nAround four in ten people who had to work from home because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic said they planned to work mostly from home in the future, when asked in February 2022.

The impact of this on migration is difficult to disentangle from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nOperational processes were also impacted during the coronavirus pandemic, which affected the collection of some administrative data. The National Insurance Number (NINo) registration service was partially suspended in March 2020 for certain customers, with a phased return to normal operations completed by April 2021. Some of the trends seen in EU migration from RAPID may be affected by these restrictions, where some migrants may have arrived in the UK but were unable to register for their NINo. Therefore, they may not be included in the estimates from RAPID. For more information on the suspension of the NINo application process, see\u00a0National Insurance numbers allocated to adult overseas nationals.\nFor the YE June 2021, net migration for non-EU nationals was positive (251,000).

They are our first set of estimates to cover a whole year (July 2020 to June 2021), when migration behaviour was impacted by coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions as well as ongoing changes in migration policy following Brexit.\nThey are available for immigration, emigration and net flows by British, European Union (EU) and non-EU nationality groups and will feed into the UK 2021 mid-year population estimates (MYEs) published in autumn of 2022 and into the Scottish 2021 MYEs in July 2022.\nThese estimates are produced using a different method to those previously published. This means that they cannot be compared with previous estimates such as those produced from the International Passenger Survey (published in\u00a0Migration Statistics Quarterly Report) or more recently using statistical modelling (published in\u00a0Long-term international migration, provisional: year ending December 2020). As with the latter, these current estimates are experimental and uncertain and we plan to revise them, both as our understanding of the data and estimation improves and as migration patterns begin to normalise following the dislocation and impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAlongside YE June 2021 estimates we have provided YE June 2020 estimates to enable year-on-year change on a comparable basis. We have not provided a longer back series because of the experimental nature of the methods and planned revisions of migration estimates following the release of Census 2021 results later this year and the subsequent rebasing of mid-year estimates. Finally, we discuss how we could disaggregate data on reasons for migration in the future, with a focus on students in this bulletin.\nOur release coincides with the publication of the\u00a0latest immigration system statistics from the Home Office, for the period to the end of March 2022. Numbers of visas may indicate trends in the arrivals of long-term migrants but cannot indicate the net effect, once emigration is taken into account. The ONS and Home Office continue to work closely together to produce a coherent insight into UK international migration.\nThis bulletin forms part of a suite of international migration releases:\nMethods to produce provisional long-term international migration estimates, which explains the current and previous methods used to produce our experimental and provisional estimates\nan updated\u00a0Revisions policy for population and International migration statistics\nA blog explaining the work of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to estimate migration flows in the year up to June 2021, as well as our wider population plans for the coming months\n!\nThese estimates are experimental and provisional.

As more data becomes available, we have to adapt our methods accordingly.\nOur latest experimental estimates for year ending (YE) June 2021 and YE June 2020 are produced using a new method that relies less on International Passenger Survey (IPS) data and statistical modelling and makes greater use of administrative data. This is in line with our ambitions published in April 2021 in\u00a0International migration: developing our approach for producing admin-based migration estimates. In this, we shared our plans to move from IPS based estimates of intended migration to estimates based on actual activity observed in administrative datasets. Observed migration activity, from early insights of provisional census results, provide some confidence that these estimates derived from administrative data sources are more accurate than those derived using previous methods. Additionally, using these data and methods produces estimates that are more comparable with the latest Home Office statistics on the operation of the immigration system. However, these are still experimental estimates and may change in the future as our understanding of the data improves. Further details on\u00a0our current and previous methods are available in the methodology\u00a0that we have also published today.\nFull results from the Census 2021 will be available later in 2022. This, alongside administrative data, will provide the clearest possible picture of international migration flows over the last decade. Following the rebasing of the mid-year population estimates that are due for release in spring 2023, we aim to use all the available information to publish a revised back series of long-term international migration flows over the course of the last decade.\n!\nThese estimates are experimental and provisional. They are based on administrative data and supported by\u00a0statistical modelling. There is a degree of uncertainty around them that we are unable to quantify at this time.\nBack to table of contents\n5.\nNet migration to the UK in the year ending June 2021\nThe estimates for year ending (YE) June 2020 and YE June 2021 have a degree of uncertainty around them.

This compares with 260,000 in the YE June 2020 using the same experimental method. Almost all of this net migration is accounted for by non-EU nationals.\n\nFigure 1: Total net international migration was mainly driven by non-EU nationals in year ending June 2021\nBreakdown of net migration by nationality, year ending June 2020 and year ending June 2021\nYE Jun 2020\nYE Jun 2021\nBritish\nEU\nnon-EU\nAll\n-50,000\n0\n50,000\n100,000\n150,000\n200,000\n250,000\n300,000\nPersons\nBritish\n\u25cf\u00a0YE Jun 2020: 11,000\nSource: Office for National Statistics; Department for Work and Pensions \u2013 Registration and Population Interaction Database (RAPID); Home Office\nNotes:\nExcludes some EU Nationals who were unable to register for a National Insurance Number (NINo) during the pandemic as a consequence of a partial suspension of DWP NINo registration services.\nWe are developing estimates of international migration using new methods and data sources.

The restrictions associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a huge impact on travel patterns, with historical migration trends and typical behaviour patterns significantly disrupted. The other major event that occurred, in the year ending June 2021, was the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020, and the introduction of a new immigration system. The impact of this on migration is difficult to disentangle from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nOperational processes were also impacted during the coronavirus pandemic, which affected the collection of some administrative data. The National Insurance Number (NINo) registration service was partially suspended in March 2020 for certain customers, with a phased return to normal operations completed by April 2021. Some of the trends seen in EU migration from RAPID may be affected by these restrictions, where some migrants may have arrived in the UK but were unable to register for their NINo. Therefore, they may not be included in the estimates from RAPID. For more information on the suspension of the NINo application process, see\u00a0National Insurance numbers allocated to adult overseas nationals.\nFor the YE June 2021, net migration for non-EU nationals was positive (251,000). This is slightly higher than for the YE June 2020 (224,000). EU net migration was estimated at -12,000 compared with 24,000 in the year ending June 2020. British net migration was close to zero in YE June 2021, because of a similar number of British nationals estimated to have migrated (around 60,000) into the country as left (Figure 1).", "summary": "Net migration fell slightly during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\u00a0\nAround 239,000 more people moved to the UK than left in the year to June 2021, according to new experimental and provisional statistics.

Experimental Statistics.\nBack to table of contents\n3.\nGlossary\nSelf-isolation\nSelf-isolation refers to not leaving your home because you have, or might have, coronavirus (COVID-19). On 24 February 2022, the legal requirement to self-isolate for those testing positive for COVID-19 was removed, but adults and children who tested positive were advised to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for at least five full days, and to follow the guidance until they have received two negative test results on consecutive days. Respondents in this survey tested positive after this policy change and were therefore not legally required to self-isolate.\nOn 1 April 2022, the government released new guidance aimed at all those who had either tested positive for COVID-19 or were experiencing symptoms of any a respiratory infection including COVID-19. The guidance advises those with symptoms to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people, especially those at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell, until they no longer have symptoms or feel unwell. The guidance also advises that additional measures are taken when leaving the home including wearing a face covering and avoiding crowded places. Those that test positive are advised to follow this guidance for five days from the day they took their test. This change occurred during the data collection period for this survey.\nFor more information, see\u00a0People with symptoms of a respiratory infection including COVID-19\u00a0on the gov.uk website.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms that indicate an individual should self-isolate prior to a positive test result are:\na high temperature\na new continuous cough\nloss of sense of smell or taste\nSymptoms reported by respondents that do not indicate a need to self-isolate if experienced without a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste are:\nshortness of breath or trouble breathing\nrunny or stuffy nose\nmuscle or body aches\nheadaches\nsore throat\nfatigue\nvomiting\ndiarrhoea\nsevere stomach pain\nFrom 1 April 2022, NHS England published an\u00a0updated list of coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms. They advised that individuals should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if they have symptoms of COVID-19 and either have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to go to work or do normal activities. This change happened during the data collection period for this survey.\nStatistical significance\nThe term \"significant\" refers to statistically significant changes or differences. Significance has been determined using the 95% confidence intervals, where instances of non-overlapping confidence intervals between estimates indicate the difference is unlikely to have arisen from random fluctuation. More information is available on our release,\u00a0Uncertainty and how we measure it for our surveys.\nBack to table of contents\n4.\nMeasuring the data\nThis is the last bulletin in the series; because of policy changes we will no longer be collecting data on self-isolation behaviours and attitudes.\nSurvey information\nThe latest quality and methodology information on data from the COVID Test and Trace Cases Insights Survey can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus and self-isolation after testing positive in England methodology.\nEstimates for Wave 14\nThis is the 14th and last bulletin in this series. The 14th wave of data was collected between 28 March and 2 April 2022. The number of respondents for this wave was 765. As this is the last wave of the series, we will no longer be collecting data and reporting on the behaviour of individuals advised to self-isolate after testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19).\nFollowing the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement that contact tracing would cease from 24 February 2022, the data source used for sampling from Wave 13 onwards is different from previous waves. Earlier waves contained data collected as part of the contact tracing process, whereas the database used in Waves 13 and 14 contain only information collected at the time of registering a positive test. Respondents were sampled from this database using implicit stratification by region, sex and age.\nThe characteristics of people taking COVID-19 tests have also likely changed. Since 24 February 2022, close contacts are no longer informed by the contact tracing system that they may be infected; this will likely change test-taking behaviour in different demographic groups.\nRespondents were aged 18 years and over and had tested positive for COVID-19 on either 22 or 25 March 2022. The survey was conducted over the telephone and all answers were self-reported.\nAround one in ten respondents (11%) completed their telephone survey on or after 1 April 2022 and were therefore subject to the latest guidance.\nThe majority (more than 99%) of respondents were interviewed between 5 and 10 days after starting their self-isolation. The remaining up to 1% of respondents were interviewed on day 11 after starting their self-isolation.\nOf the potential respondents who were successfully contacted by an interviewer, the response rate was 77% with 765 (19%) total achieved interviews. When including cases where contact was attempted but not made, the response rate was 28%.\nA low response rate can be expected because the target population may have been unwell with COVID-19, and therefore less likely to participate.\nPercentages in this report are based on weighted counts that are representative of the population of adults (aged 18 years and over) who had tested positive for COVID-19 and began their self-isolation period between 28 February and 27 March inclusive.\nExperimental Statistics\nThe statistics presented are Experimental Statistics, so care needs to be taken when interpreting them. The survey has a relatively small number of respondents (765) and the behaviour of respondents during self-isolation is self-reported.\nBack to table of contents\n5.\nStrengths and limitations\nInformation on the strengths and limitations of this survey is available in the\u00a0Coronavirus and self-isolation after testing positive in England methodology.\n", "summary": "Half of COVID-19 cases followed self-isolation guidance\nAround half (51%) of people in England who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on 22 or 25 March 2022 fully complied with self-isolation guidance.\nThis is statistically significantly lower than in early March 2022 (64%) and February 2022 (80%).\nOf those who did not fully follow the guidance, more than 9 in 10 (93%) reported leaving the house for a non-compliant reason, most commonly for outdoor recreation or exercise (37%).\nNew guidance for those who test positive, or experience symptoms of COVID-19 or any respiratory infections, was released on 1 April 2022, during the survey period.\nThis now advises them to stay home and avoid contact with others for five days from the day they took a test, and until they no longer have symptoms.

The previous release used linkage of death registrations to the 2011 Census to account for demographic, socio-economic, geographic and health characteristics also associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection and death.\nIn previous releases we have reported on deaths by learning disability status. We have not included that analysis in this report as we are developing a programme of work drawing on, among others, Census 2021 data and linkage of administrative data sources. The aim is to provide estimates for different impairment types to reflect the variety of experiences among disabled people, including learning disability.\nWe explore whether differences in the risk of COVID-19 mortality between disabled and non-disabled people have changed over the course of the coronavirus pandemic and vaccination programme. Therefore, analyses have been extended to cover deaths occurring up to 9 March 2022 and stratified by\u00a0coronavirus pandemic waves:\nWave 1 - deaths occurring between 24 January and 11 September 2020\u2028\nWave 2 - deaths occurring between 12 September 2020 and 11 June 2021\u2028\nWave 3 - deaths occurring between 12 June 2021 and 9 March 2022\u2028\nThis article presents a summary of findings and highlights\u00a0statistically significant\u00a0differences in mortality rates between disabled and non-disabled populations. Please refer to the\u00a0accompanying datasets\u00a0for detailed breakdowns of analysis.\nWe compared the relative risk of death involving COVID-19 by self-reported disability status across all three waves of the coronavirus pandemic after adjusting for age, place of residence, geography, socio-economic and demographic factors, and health characteristics. Reflecting the progress of the vaccination roll out, our analysis of the second wave further adjusts for first and second vaccination doses, and the third wave adjusts for first, second and third doses. We do this by linkage to vaccination data from the\u00a0National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS)\u00a0for vaccination occurring on or after 8 December 2020.\n!\nEstimates for the third wave are provisional, as the third wave may extend beyond the study period. Also, it is possible that some deaths involving COVID-19 that occurred in this period have not yet been registered. Similarly, some vaccinations administered during the study period may not yet have been recorded.\nBack to table of contents\n3.\nAge-standardised mortality rates involving COVID-19 by self-reported disability status\nFigure 1: More-disabled people had the highest age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rate compared with less- and non-disabled people across all three waves of the coronavirus pandemic\nAge-standardised mortality rates for deaths involving COVID-19 with 95% confidence intervals, by sex and self-reported disability status, stratified by waves, England: 24 January 2020 to 9 March 2022\n\n\n \n\nEmbed code\n<iframe width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1941/fig1/index.html\"></iframe>\n\nNotes:\nOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures are based on death registrations involving COVID-19 up to 23 March 2022 for people aged 30 to 100 years occurring between 24 January and 9 March 2022 that could be linked to the 2011 Census and General Practice Extraction Service Data for Pandemic and Planning Research.\u2028\nDeaths were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Deaths involving COVID-19 include those with an underlying cause, or any mention, of ICD-10 codes U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified), U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified) or U09.9 (Post-COVID condition).\u2028\nDisability status was defined according to the 2011 Census question; \"Are your day-to-day activities limited because of a health problem or disability which has lasted, or is expected to last, at least 12 months? - Include problems related to old age\" (Yes, limited a lot; Yes, limited a little; and No).\u2028\nDownload the data\n.xlsx\nDisabled people were identified based on their self-reported disability status in the 2011 Census. A distinction was made between those who reported that their day-to-day activities were \"limited a little\" or \"limited a lot\" as a result of a long-term health condition. These two categories are referred to here as \"less-disabled\" and \"more-disabled\" respectively, whereas people reporting no limitation to their activities are referred to as \"non-disabled\". The distinction between less-disabled and more-disabled is based solely on 2011 Census data and not inferred from any other information. Therefore, it only implies a difference based on self-reported activity restrictions.\nFigure 1 presents annualised\u00a0age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs)\u00a0involving coronavirus (COVID-19) among both men and women aged between 30 and 100 years. ASMRs allow populations with different age structures to be compared fairly. Disability is more common in older populations; therefore, it is important to adjust for population age structure in this way. In addition, using annualised rates enable periods of different length to be compared fairly. We adjust for time to be able to compare coronavirus pandemic waves of different duration.\nDisabled people had a higher rate of death involving COVID-19 across each wave of the coronavirus pandemic, between 24 January 2020 and 9 March 2022, compared with non-disabled people.\nMore-disabled men had a statistically significantly higher rate of death involving COVID-19 than less-disabled men across each wave; a similar pattern was reflected in disabled women.\nIn the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic (deaths occurring between 12 June 2021 and 9 March 2022), there was a decrease in the absolute rates of death for disabled and non-disabled people, compared with the first and second waves. However, the relative rates of death between disabled and non-disabled people did not decrease between the second and third wave of the pandemic.\nRelative to non-disabled men, mortality rates were 3.1 times higher for more-disabled men in the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic (303.7 per 100,000 person-years in non-disabled men compared with 942.1 per 100,000 person-years in more-disabled men). This raised rate of death for more-disabled men persisted in the third wave.\nThe mortality rate for more-disabled women was 3.8 times higher than for non-disabled women in the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic (670.2 compared with 174.7 for non-disabled women). In the third wave of the pandemic, the mortality rate for more-disabled women was 4.6 times higher (246.8) than the rate in non-disabled women (54.1).\nOn average, across all waves, mortality rates for less-disabled men were almost twice as high as rates for men who are not disabled (1.8 times, 1.9 times and 1.9 times, for waves 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Similar patterns were seen in the relative rates for less-disabled women, whereby their rates were 2.0 times, 2.0 times and 2.1 times higher than in non-disabled women across the three waves.\nBack to table of contents\n4.\nRisk of death involving COVID-19 by self-reported disability status\nWe used statistical models (Cox proportional hazards regression) to estimate how differences in the risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) changed when adjusting for a range of factors affecting both the risk of infection and the risk of death if infected. This approach helps us to understand which factors may be driving the differences in mortality by disability status.\nWe report\u00a0hazard ratios (HR)\u00a0for each disability status relative to the non-disabled group. The HR is a measure of how much greater or lesser the risk of death involving COVID-19 is in the two disabled groups compared with non-disabled people. A HR greater than 1 indicates a greater risk of death involving COVID-19 compared with the reference group (non-disabled people).

Deaths involving COVID-19 include those with an underlying cause, or any mention, of ICD-10 codes U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified), U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified) or U09.9 (Post-COVID condition).\u2028\nDownload the data\n.xlsx\nSimilar to our\u00a0previous publication, after adjusting for age only, men and women from both disabled groups were at a greater risk of death involving COVID-19 compared with non-disabled people. Further stepwise adjustment for residence type, geography and socio-demographic characteristics accounts for a substantial decrease in the elevated COVID-19 mortality risk for disabled people of both groups and both sexes, relative to non-disabled people (Figure 2).\nThis decrease in relative risk was greater for more-disabled individuals compared with less-disabled individuals. Adjusting for age only, the relative risk of death was 3.1 times higher for more-disabled men relative to non-disabled men. This raised risk of death was 2.1 times higher after adjusting for residence type, geography and socio-economic characteristics. In comparison, when adjusting for age only, the raised risk of death for less-disabled men was 1.9 times higher compared with non-disabled men, and 1.6 times higher after adjusting for the same additional characteristics.\nA similar trend was seen between more- and less-disabled women. After adjusting for age only, the corresponding relative risk for more-disabled women was 3.6 times higher compared with non-disabled women, and 2.4 times higher after further adjusting for residence type, geography and socio-economic characteristics. In comparison, less-disabled women had a risk of death 2.0 times higher after adjusting for age, and 1.7 times higher adjusting for the same additional characteristics.\nSeveral factors may explain the greater decrease in relative risk for more-disabled people, when accounting for age, residence type, geography and socio-economic characteristics. More-disabled people might be disproportionately exposed to a range of disadvantageous conditions reflected in our residence type, geographic and socio-demographic variables.\nMore-disabled people might be more likely to live in a communal establishment, or be in contact with a keyworker, two variables included in our residence type and socio-demographic characteristics (see\u00a0Updated estimates of coronavirus (COVID-19) related deaths by disability status, England methodology\u00a0for further details). These factors are known to increase the risk of COVID-19 related death. Adjusting for these characteristics may highlight a difference in the exposure to disadvantageous circumstances faced by more-disabled individuals, relative to less and non-disabled people.\nAfter controlling for age, residence type, geography and socio-demographic factors, we control for pre-existing conditions and hospital admissions. Subsequently, the relative risk of death decreased from 2.1 to 1.4 times higher for more-disabled men compared to non-disabled men, over the whole of the coronavirus pandemic period. Adjusting for health characteristics, the relative risk of death for less-disabled men also significantly decreased compared with non-disabled men. Similar patterns were also seen for more- and less-disabled women, compared with non-disabled women.\nIn contrast, further adjusting for vaccination status (Figure 2) does not significantly decrease the elevated risk of COVID-19 death for all disabled individuals of both sexes, relative to their non-disabled counterparts. This shows that the differences in the proportions of disabled and non-disabled people who have received the same number of vaccinations does not further explain the elevated risk of COVID-19 related death faced by disabled people.\n!\nWhere the risk remains broadly the same after adjusting for vaccination status, it does not mean the vaccine is not effective. It simply means differences in vaccination coverage between the groups do not explain observed differences in mortality risk. For analyses of vaccine effectiveness, see\u00a0Monitoring reports of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination on GOV.UK.\nFor all disabled people, an unexplained elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality remained after adjusting for relevant factors: age, residence type, geography, socio-demographic factors, health characteristics and vaccination status, relative to non-disabled individuals. Fully adjusted models revealed men and women from both disabled groups were at greater risk of death involving COVID-19 compared with non-disabled people (Figure 2).\nFully adjusted models further show the risk of death involving COVID-19 for more- and less-disabled men were 1.4 and 1.3 times greater, respectively, than for non-disabled men. The corresponding risks for women were 1.6 and 1.3, respectively. More-disabled women were at a statistically significantly higher risk of death than more-disabled men. Adjusting for all relevant factors accounts for the difference in the elevated risk of COVID-19 death between less-disabled men and less-disabled women. More-disabled people of both sexes faced the highest risk of COVID-19 mortality, followed by less-disabled people.\nOur previous analysis in\u00a0Updated estimates of coronavirus (COVID-19) related deaths by disability status, England: 24 January to 20 November 2020\u00a0revealed that adjusting for age, residence type, geography, socio-economic and health characteristics fully accounted for the elevated risk of death observed between less-disabled and non-disabled men.\nIn this release, despite adjusting for similar factors, a smaller but statistically significant elevated risk of death remains for less-disabled men, compared with non-disabled men. This may be because of a number of reasons, among others, this release extends the period of analysis to 9 March 2022, and features vaccination status. In addition, we used an updated version of the\u00a0General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for Pandemic Planning and Research (GDPPR),\u00a0which means the models are not strictly comparable over different releases. No changes were made to the way we define disability. Please refer to\u00a0Updated estimates of coronavirus (COVID-19) related deaths by disability status, England, methodology\u00a0for more details.\nWe find that no single factor explains the elevated risk of death involving COVID-19 among disabled people. For both sexes, and for both more- and less-disabled people. The largest reduction in the risk of death was achieved by accounting for socio-economic and geographic characteristics and pre-existing health and hospital admissions in the model. The former group of factors included region, ethnicity, area deprivation, household composition and occupation, all of which affect the risk of death involving COVID-19. Therefore, it can be inferred that a large part (but not all) of the increased risk is because disabled people are disproportionately exposed to a broad range of generally disadvantageous circumstances compared with non-disabled people.\nBack to table of contents\n5.\nDifference between the risk of death involving COVID-19 during the coronavirus pandemic waves by self-reported disability status\nFigure 3: Elevated COVID-19 mortality risk for disabled people (relative to non-disabled people) remained largely unchanged during the first, second and third waves of the coronavirus pandemic\nHazard ratios for deaths involving COVID-19 for disabled men and women relative to non-disabled people of the same sex, in the first (24 January to 11 September 2020), second (12 September 2020 to 11 June 2021) and third (12 June 2021 to 9 March 2022) waves of the coronavirus pandemic, adjusting for age, residence type, geography, socio-economic and demographic factors, health characteristics, and vaccination status, England\nThe chart canvas is hidden from screen readers.

Using business turnover estimates from HM Revenue and Customs Value Added Tax (VAT) data, our analysis finds wide-ranging impacts \"between\" and \"within\" high-contact service industries.\n1.\nMain points\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to wide-ranging impacts on business turnover between and within \"high-contact\" industries - wholesale and retail; transportation and storage; accommodation and food services; arts, entertainment and recreation; and other services.\u2028\nThe wholesale and retail industry had the smallest fall in turnover following the national lockdowns, although \"within\" effects show that non-essential retail stores were more adversely affected, while outdoor stores performed relatively stronger.\u2028\nThe largest falls in turnover in the first half of 2020 in the accommodation and food services industry were for the beverage-serving sub-industry and the hotels and similar accommodation sub-industry, while there has been stronger performance for holiday and other short-stay accommodation, camping grounds, recreational vehicle parks, and other accommodation throughout the coronavirus pandemic.\u2028\nIn the arts, entertainment, and recreation industry, the largest falls in turnover were for amusement and recreational activities, gambling and betting activities, and creative arts and entertainment activities; however, the within-industry effects imply a change in preference towards outdoor activities over indoor activities.\u2028\nBack to table of contents\n2.\nIntroduction\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had wide-ranging industry-level impacts through 2020 and 2021. The largest have typically been for\u00a0\"high-contact\" service industries\u00a0- wholesale and retail; transportation and storage; accommodation and food services; arts, entertainment and recreation; and other services. These \"high-contact\" industries are more reliant on physical interaction and so have been more adversely affected by the coronavirus restrictions that were in place. We consider \"low-contact\" industries to be all other industries that are less dependent on in-person contact.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the level of output produced by these \"high-contact\" and \"low-contact\" industries. There was a relatively larger peak-to-trough decline in output produced by the \"high-contact\" industries - a 37% fall compared with a 17% fall for \"low-contact\" industries - although there has also been more of a rebound in \"high-contact\" industries since restrictions were lifted in mid-2021.\u00a0 Similarly, there was a larger impact on employment in these \"high-contact\" industries, with a 7.6% peak-to-trough decline in payrolled employees compared with 1.7% for the \"low-contact\" industries. Furthermore, there has typically been a higher level of furloughing in \"high-contact\" industries, particularly in periods with higher levels of COVID-19 restrictions.\nFigure 1 also shows that there have been wide-ranging effects between these \"high-contact\" industries. Accommodation and food services, and the arts, entertainment and recreation industries had the largest falls in business turnover in periods of lockdown restrictions. Wholesale and retail businesses experienced the smallest decrease in business turnover and were the quickest to recover to their pre-coronavirus pandemic levels.\n\nFigure 1: \u201cHigh-contact\u201d industries experienced a greater fall in output and took longer to recover to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels relative to all other industries\nUK, gross value added (GVA), Quarter 4 2019 to Quarter 4 2021\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics \u2013 Quarterly National Accounts\nNotes:\nQ1 refers to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar), Q2 refers to Quarter 2 (Apr to June), Q3 refers to Quarter 3 (July to Sept) and Q4 refers to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec).\nIndex is referenced to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019.\n\u201cHigh-contact\u201d industries refer to the wholesale and retail; transportation and storage; accommodation and food services; arts, entertainment and recreation; and other services industries.\nThe maximum and minimum refer to the range of relative turnover levels for the five high-contact industries.\nDownload this chart\nFigure 1: \u201cHigh-contact\u201d industries experienced a greater fall in output and took longer to recover to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels relative to all other industries\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\n\nFigure 2: \"Low-contact\" industries experienced a smaller fall in output and recovered faster to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels relative to \"high-contact\" industries\nUK, gross value added (GVA), Quarter 4 2019 to Quarter 4 2021\nLow-contact\nLow-contact - maximum\nLow-contact - minimum\n2019 Q4\n2020 Q1\n2020 Q2\n2020 Q3\n2020 Q4\n2021 Q1\n2021 Q2\n2021 Q3\n2021 Q4\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nQ4 2019 = 100\n2021 Q2\n\u25cf\u00a0Low-contact: 99.1\n\u25cf\u00a0Low-contact - maximum: 113.6\n\u25cf\u00a0Low-contact - minimum: 70.2\nSource: Office for National Statistics \u2013 Quarterly National Accounts\nNotes:\nQ1 refers to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar), Q2 refers to Quarter 2 (Apr to June), Q3 refers to Quarter 3 (July to Sept) and Q4 refers to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec).\nIndex is referenced to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019.\n\"Low-contact\" industries refer to all industries except \"high-contact\".\nThe maximum and minimum refer to the range of relative turnover levels for low level contact industries.\nDownload this chart\nFigure 2: \"Low-contact\" industries experienced a smaller fall in output and recovered faster to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels relative to \"high-contact\" industries\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\nMuch of the focus has been on these between-industry effects - that is, at the level of these five \"high-contact\" industries only (Figure 1). However, we are interested in exploring any impacts at the sub-industry level so we can see if there have been any within-industry effects in these five \"high-contact\" industries. This will offer further insight into how businesses and consumers might have adapted over the last two years.\nOur new findings are based on current price turnover estimates in Value Added Tax (VAT) returns provided by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). These VAT-based estimates of turnover are not seasonally adjusted, and they might be subject to revisions at a later stage. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the provision of\u00a0non-market output\u00a0are not included here, given we focus on VAT-based estimates of turnover. The percentage changes are based on aggregates calculated following Office for National Statistics (ONS) processing of VAT data, which includes estimation for non-response.\nThese VAT-based estimates provide the scope for more granular insights at the industry level - in particular, we look at the three-digit industry level. Given that these are based on VAT turnover only, we would recommend focusing more on the relative impacts that are shown at this level to understand these within-industry effects, rather than focusing on absolute levels.\nBack to table of contents\n3.\nWholesale and retail trade\nWholesale and retail businesses have been the least adversely affected among the \"high-contact\" industries, experiencing the smallest initial fall in turnover of 26% in the first half of 2020 relative to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels (Figure 3). However, Figure 3 shows there are wide-ranging impacts on the sub-industries within wholesale and retail, partly reflecting that some of these industries feature essential retail while others are considered non-essential and were subject to coronavirus restrictions. Furthermore, some of the retail sub-industries were able to benefit from the shift to online shopping.\nRetail sales of information and communication equipment in specialised stores (negative 55%) and retail sales of other goods in specialised stores (negative 44%) were the sub-industries that saw the largest falls in the first half of 2020. These sub-industries are considered non-essential - for example, they include the retail sales of television and video games, and watches and jewellery. In contrast, retail sales in non-specialised stores had the smallest fall in business turnover of 7% in the first two quarters of 2020, which includes essential food stores, and were protected from requirements to close during the first national lockdown.\nRetail trade, not in store, stalls or markets was the only retail sub-industry that had a rise in business turnover through the first lockdown. It remained above its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2021. This industry benefitted from\u00a0record online sales\u00a0during the coronavirus pandemic as consumers shifted from in-store purchases to online shopping and businesses responded to higher demand by raising their online and delivery operational capacities.\nThere was a large pickup in business turnover for the retail sales via stalls and markets sub-industry, which was at 43% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level in Quarter 3 2021. This could reflect the public\u2019s preference for outdoor retailing as a way to avoid transmission of the coronavirus. In Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020,\u00a0just under 4 in 10 adults said they felt safe leaving their home\u00a0because of the coronavirus outbreak. By Quarter 3 2021, this had risen to more than half of adults reporting that they felt comfortable leaving their home.\n\nFigure 3: The retail industry saw a shift from in-store purchases to online and outdoor shopping from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic\nPercentage change in business turnover for retail sub-industries, Quarter 2 2020 compared with Quarter 4 2019; and Quarter 3 2021 compared with Quarter 4 2019, UK\n\nSource: Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC)\nNotes:\nThis shows the percentage change in VAT-recorded business turnover relative to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019.\nOnline-only retail sales are included in \"not in stores, stalls or markets\".\nDownload this chart\nFigure 3: The retail industry saw a shift from in-store purchases to online and outdoor shopping from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\nBack to table of contents\n4.\nTransportation and storage\nFigure 4 shows that there have been large differences in the impact on business turnover within the transport industry. There was a 78% decline in turnover for the passenger air transport sub-industry in the first half of 2020, which was the sharpest fall across the industry. This was because of\u00a0international mobility restrictions, which were introduced to reduce the transmission of the coronavirus and only permitted essential travel. There were similar large falls in business turnover for inland passenger water transport, passenger rail transport, and sea and coastal passenger water transport. These were all affected by coronavirus restrictions reflecting the \"stay at home\" advice that restricted travel for personal and work reasons.\nAlthough there has been some easing in coronavirus restrictions on travel over time, the\u00a0Google mobility reports\u00a0show that, in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2021, visitors to public transport hubs were still below their pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. Passenger air transport, sea and coastal passenger water transport, and passenger rail transport all had business turnover that was more than 40% below their pre-coronavirus pandemic levels in Quarter 3 2021 (Figure 4). This partial recovery in passenger transport activity is likely to reflect continuing caution by some members of the public, along with a reduction in work-related commuting because of the\u00a0increased take-up of remote and hybrid working.\nIn contrast, commercial serving transport sub-industries were less adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which might reflect the more essential nature of these travel services. Freight transport by road and removal services, and inland freight water transport, saw the smallest falls in turnover. By Quarter 3 2021, these sub-industries had recovered to above their pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. Freight transport by road and removal services had business turnover 9% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels while inland freight water transport was 8% above. These sub-industries may have also seen large price rises charged for their services because of higher costs of complying with COVID-19 procedures, although any impact on higher turnover levels would not necessarily reflect increasing profits.\n\nFigure 4: Personal transport was largely affected by domestic and international mobility constraints, while business transport experienced minimal impacts\nPercentage change in business turnover for transport sub-industries, Quarter 2 2020 compared with Quarter 4 2019; and Quarter 3 2021 compared with Quarter 4 2019, UK\n\nSource: Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC)\nNotes:\nThis shows the percentage change in VAT-recorded business turnover relative to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019.\nDownload this chart\nFigure 4: Personal transport was largely affected by domestic and international mobility constraints, while business transport experienced minimal impacts\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\nBack to table of contents\n5.\nAccommodation and food services\nAmong all the \"high-contact\" industries, the accommodation and food services industry had the largest initial fall in turnover. Figure 5 shows that all sub-industries had a contraction of more than 50% in business turnover, although the speed of their recovery has varied. The largest fall in turnover was for the beverage-serving sub-industry (92%) and the hotels and similar accommodation sub-industry (86%). Following the easing of restrictions, there was a sharp rebound in their turnover. By Quarter 3 2021, turnover for the beverage-serving sub-industry was 5% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, while the hotels and similar accommodation sub-industry had almost recovered. During the coronavirus pandemic, the hotels and similar accommodation sub-industry were particularly affected by falls in foreign tourists to the UK. For example,\u00a0overseas residents\u00a0made 398,000 visits to the UK in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020; this was 96% fewer than Quarter 2 2019. This is also evident in Quarter 3 2020.\nIn contrast, there has been stronger performance for other sub-industries such as the holiday and other short-stay accommodation, camping grounds, recreational vehicle parks, and other accommodation groups. This indicates a shift in consumers' holiday and leisure preferences, reflected in the switch from international to\u00a0domestic holidays\u00a0(so called staycations), which led to the rise of self-catered domestic holiday and other short-stay accommodations.\nTurnover for the restaurants and mobile food services sub-industry is now 16% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, recovering from being 74% below in Quarter 2 2020. Businesses adapted to coronavirus restrictions so that they could continue to trade. Some of these business adaptions include restaurants making changes to dining areas to allow for social distancing and moving to take-away and home deliveries.\n\nFigure 5: There has been a shift towards holiday accommodations in camping, trailer parks and other short-stay accommodations over the course of the coronavirus pandemic\nPercentage change in business turnover for accommodation and food service sub-industries, Quarter 2 2020 compared with Quarter 4 2019; and Quarter 3 2021 compared with Quarter 4 2019, UK\nQuarter 2 2020\nQuarter 3 2021\nHoliday and other short-stay accommodation\nCamping grounds recreational vehicle parks and trailer parks\nOther accommodation\nRestaurants and mobile food service activities\nBeverage serving activities\nHotels and similar accommodation\nEvent catering and other food service activities\n-100\n0\n-75\n-50\n-25\n25\n50\n75\nvs Quarter 4 2019 (%)\nSource: Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC)\nNotes:\nThis shows the percentage change in VAT-recorded business turnover relative to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019.\nDownload this chart\nFigure 5: There has been a shift towards holiday accommodations in camping, trailer parks and other short-stay accommodations over the course of the coronavirus pandemic\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\nBack to table of contents\n6.\nArts, entertainment and recreation\nThere is a sharp contrast in the performance of sub-industries within the arts, entertainment, and recreation industry (Figure 6). The largest falls in turnover were experienced by amusement and recreational activities (72%), gambling and betting activities (70%), and creative arts and entertainment activities (64%). However, there have also been vast differences in recovery of business turnover to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels between the sub-industries, which possibly indicates a preference towards outdoor activities over indoor activities.\nFor instance, the amusement and recreation activities sub-industry, which includes botanical gardens and nature reserves, saw a strong recovery with turnover 66% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2021. This in part reflects people's preferences towards outdoor activities and socialising to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. According to the\u00a0Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, 37% visited a park or local green space in Quarter 3 2021, rising from 23% a year earlier. Gambling and betting activities also experienced a recovery to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels following the lifting of the suspension of professional sports.\nCreative arts and entertainment, and sports activities, continue to remain below their pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. The creative arts and entertainment sub-industry, which includes indoor facilities such as cinemas and theatres, might have seen reluctance from people to take up these services because of cautious behaviour to avoid the risk of coronavirus transmission and a preference towards outdoor activities. We do not have pre-coronavirus pandemic comparisons, but the\u00a0Opinions and Lifestyle Survey\u00a0found that only 4% of adults visited cinemas or theatres in Quarter 3 2021, following the easing of restrictions - this had slightly increased to 9% by Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2022. It is also possible that this reflected a shift towards online streaming. As evidenced in the Business Insights and Conditions Survey, some entertainment facilities such as theatres are likely to have also been affected by\u00a0staff shortages\u00a0because of self-isolation. For example, the proportion of the workforce in the industry on sick leave because of self-isolation increased to 3% by Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2021.\n\nFigure 6: Creative, arts and entertainment activities are still below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, which might reflect some reluctance to attend indoor venues\nPercentage change in business turnover for arts, entertainment and recreation service sub-industries, Quarter 2 2020 compared with Quarter 4 2019; and Quarter 3 2021 compared with Quarter 4 2019, UK\nQuarter 2 2020\nQuarter 3 2021\nAmusement and recreation activities\nLibraries archives museums and other cultural activities\nGambling and betting activities\nSports activities\nCreative arts and entertainment activities\n0\n-75\n-50\n-25\n25\n50\n75\nvs Quarter 4 2019 (%)\nSource: Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC)\nNotes:\nThis shows the percentage change in VAT-recorded business turnover relative to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019.\nDownload this chart\nFigure 6: Creative, arts and entertainment activities are still below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, which might reflect some reluctance to attend indoor venues\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\nBack to table of contents\n7.\nOther services\nIn Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2021, business turnover for almost all other service sub-industries remained below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels (Figure 7). The largest initial decline was for other personal service activities (39%), which relies on face-to-face contact. For example, this includes services such as hairdressing, which had a fall in business revenue of 83% in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020. By Quarter 3 2021, business turnover for other personal service activities had partially recovered to being 10% below its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels.\nThe repairs of personal and household goods, such as kitchen appliances, home furnishings and garden equipment, increased with the rise of home relocation and home improvements throughout the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, repair of electronics and office furnishings (within the repair of personal and household goods sub-industry) was boosted by the rise of working-from-home activities and online teaching because of school, college, and university closures. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic,\u00a0around 5%\u00a0of the UK workforce reported mainly working from home in 2019. In Quarter 2 2020, just over\u00a0a quarter of adults (30%)\u00a0worked exclusively at home, remaining at this level until Quarter 2 2021.\n\nFigure 7: Other services activities were affected by the necessity of face-to-face contact with consumers\nPercentage change in business turnover for other service sub-industries, Quarter 2 2020 compared with Quarter 4 2019; and Quarter 3 2021 compared with Quarter 4 2019, UK\n\nSource: Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC)\nNotes:\nThis shows the percentage change in VAT-recorded business turnover relative to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019.\nDownload this chart\nFigure 7: Other services activities were affected by the necessity of face-to-face contact with consumers\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\nBack to table of contents\n8.\nGlossary\nGross value added (GVA)\nThis is the value generated by any unit engaged in production and the contributions of individual sectors or industries to gross domestic product (GDP).\u00a0\n\"High-contact\" industries\nThese are industries that are more reliant on physical interaction.

These VAT-based estimates of turnover are not seasonally adjusted, and they can be subject to revisions at a later stage. Traders must register for VAT with HMRC when their VAT taxable turnover over the previous 12 months exceeds the registration threshold, which is currently set to \u00a385,000, or if they expect their VAT taxable turnover to exceed this limit over the next 30 days. To process VAT data, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) uses a statistical processing platform (SPPV), which transforms the administrative dataset to a level that is consistent with our business surveys.

The largest have typically been for\u00a0\"high-contact\" service industries\u00a0- wholesale and retail; transportation and storage; accommodation and food services; arts, entertainment and recreation; and other services. These \"high-contact\" industries are more reliant on physical interaction and so have been more adversely affected by the coronavirus restrictions that were in place. We consider \"low-contact\" industries to be all other industries that are less dependent on in-person contact.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the level of output produced by these \"high-contact\" and \"low-contact\" industries. There was a relatively larger peak-to-trough decline in output produced by the \"high-contact\" industries - a 37% fall compared with a 17% fall for \"low-contact\" industries - although there has also been more of a rebound in \"high-contact\" industries since restrictions were lifted in mid-2021.\u00a0 Similarly, there was a larger impact on employment in these \"high-contact\" industries, with a 7.6% peak-to-trough decline in payrolled employees compared with 1.7% for the \"low-contact\" industries. Furthermore, there has typically been a higher level of furloughing in \"high-contact\" industries, particularly in periods with higher levels of COVID-19 restrictions.\nFigure 1 also shows that there have been wide-ranging effects between these \"high-contact\" industries. Accommodation and food services, and the arts, entertainment and recreation industries had the largest falls in business turnover in periods of lockdown restrictions. Wholesale and retail businesses experienced the smallest decrease in business turnover and were the quickest to recover to their pre-coronavirus pandemic levels.\n\n3.\nWholesale and retail trade\nWholesale and retail businesses have been the least adversely affected among the \"high-contact\" industries, experiencing the smallest initial fall in turnover of 26% in the first half of 2020 relative to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels (Figure 3). However, Figure 3 shows there are wide-ranging impacts on the sub-industries within wholesale and retail, partly reflecting that some of these industries feature essential retail while others are considered non-essential and were subject to coronavirus restrictions. Furthermore, some of the retail sub-industries were able to benefit from the shift to online shopping.\nRetail sales of information and communication equipment in specialised stores (negative 55%) and retail sales of other goods in specialised stores (negative 44%) were the sub-industries that saw the largest falls in the first half of 2020. These sub-industries are considered non-essential - for example, they include the retail sales of television and video games, and watches and jewellery. In contrast, retail sales in non-specialised stores had the smallest fall in business turnover of 7% in the first two quarters of 2020, which includes essential food stores, and were protected from requirements to close during the first national lockdown.\nRetail trade, not in store, stalls or markets was the only retail sub-industry that had a rise in business turnover through the first lockdown. It remained above its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2021. This industry benefitted from\u00a0record online sales\u00a0during the coronavirus pandemic as consumers shifted from in-store purchases to online shopping and businesses responded to higher demand by raising their online and delivery operational capacities.\nThere was a large pickup in business turnover for the retail sales via stalls and markets sub-industry, which was at 43% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level in Quarter 3 2021. This could reflect the public\u2019s preference for outdoor retailing as a way to avoid transmission of the coronavirus. In Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020,\u00a0just under 4 in 10 adults said they felt safe leaving their home\u00a0because of the coronavirus outbreak. By Quarter 3 2021, this had risen to more than half of adults reporting that they felt comfortable leaving their home.\n\n5.\nAccommodation and food services\nAmong all the \"high-contact\" industries, the accommodation and food services industry had the largest initial fall in turnover. Figure 5 shows that all sub-industries had a contraction of more than 50% in business turnover, although the speed of their recovery has varied. The largest fall in turnover was for the beverage-serving sub-industry (92%) and the hotels and similar accommodation sub-industry (86%). Following the easing of restrictions, there was a sharp rebound in their turnover. By Quarter 3 2021, turnover for the beverage-serving sub-industry was 5% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, while the hotels and similar accommodation sub-industry had almost recovered. During the coronavirus pandemic, the hotels and similar accommodation sub-industry were particularly affected by falls in foreign tourists to the UK. For example,\u00a0overseas residents\u00a0made 398,000 visits to the UK in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020; this was 96% fewer than Quarter 2 2019. This is also evident in Quarter 3 2020.\nIn contrast, there has been stronger performance for other sub-industries such as the holiday and other short-stay accommodation, camping grounds, recreational vehicle parks, and other accommodation groups. This indicates a shift in consumers' holiday and leisure preferences, reflected in the switch from international to\u00a0domestic holidays\u00a0(so called staycations), which led to the rise of self-catered domestic holiday and other short-stay accommodations.\nTurnover for the restaurants and mobile food services sub-industry is now 16% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, recovering from being 74% below in Quarter 2 2020. Businesses adapted to coronavirus restrictions so that they could continue to trade. Some of these business adaptions include restaurants making changes to dining areas to allow for social distancing and moving to take-away and home deliveries.", "summary": "\u201cHigh-contact\u201d industries hit hardest by COVID-19 pandemic\nIn the first half of 2020, industries involving more in-person contact saw the largest fall in turnover as coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns came into force.\nThis includes wholesale and retail; transportation and storage; accommodation and food services; arts, entertainment and recreation; and other services.\nThese \u201chigh-contact\u201d industries saw a relatively larger peak-to-trough decline in output of 37% in the early stages of the pandemic, compared with 17% among \u201clow-contact\u201d industries.\nAmong \u201chigh-contact\u201d industries, wholesale and retail trade was the least affected, with a fall in turnover of 26% in the first half of 2020.\nRetail not in store, stalls or markets was an exception to this trend, seeing a rise in turnover through the first lockdown because of online shopping.\nAccommodation and food services were most affected, with the largest falls among beverage-serving industries (92%) and hotel and similar accommodation (86%).\nWhile there has been a strong recovery among the majority of \u201chigh-contact\u201d industries, businesses in creative, arts and entertainment activities remain below pre-pandemic levels, which could reflect a lingering reluctance to attend indoor events.", "id": 26}, {"document": "1.\nMain points\nConsumer behaviour indicators show growth in UK credit and debit card purchases (by 6 percentage points), with growth in all spending categories, while Google Mobility data shows growth in all categories except park visits, which fell by 19%; in comparison, UK seated diners fell by 8 percentage points in the most recent week (Bank of England CHAPS data, Google Mobility, OpenTable).\u00a0Section 3.\u2028\nTransport indicators largely showed an increase this week, with daily UK flights, total ship visits, and cargo and tanker visits increasing by 2%, 7%, and 10%, respectively; meanwhile, road traffic decreased by 19 percentage points, which is consistent with the fall in traffic volume of previous bank holidays (EUROCONTROL, exactEarth, Department for Transport).\u00a0Section 4.\u2028\nTotal online job advert volumes increased by 2% in the latest week; the largest weekly category increase was in \"HR and recruitment\" (14%), while \"travel and tourism\" online job adverts showed the largest decrease (4%) (Adzuna).\u00a0Section 5.\u2028\nIn late April 2022, 31% of businesses reported their production and/or suppliers had been affected by recent increases in energy prices; the accommodation and food service activities industry reported the highest percentage at 64% (final results from Wave 55 of the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS)).\u2028\nThe System Average Price (SAP) of gas decreased by 7% in the week to 1 May 2022, with the level now 30% of that on 10 March 2022, when prices peaked in the rolling seven-day series; the SAP is now 125% higher compared with the same period last year (week ending 2 May 2021) (National Grid).\u2028\n4.\nTransport\nTransport indicators largely showed an increase this week.

UK daily flights increased by 2% to 84% of the equivalent week in 2019.\nMeanwhile, road traffic volumes decreased by 19 percentage points on 2 May 2022. This was 80% of the level seen on the Monday of the first week in February 2020.

It was 80% of the level seen on the Monday of the first week in February 2020; this is according to the Department for Transport (DfT) non-seasonally adjusted road traffic data. This decrease in the volume of road traffic is consistent with previous bank holidays.\nOn Bank Holiday Monday, traffic volumes for heavy goods vehicles decreased by 65 percentage points in the latest week. They were 43% of the level seen on the Monday of the first week in February 2020. Light commercial vehicle traffic volumes decreased by 38 percentage points in the latest week and were 76% of the level seen in the first week of February 2020.

This was followed by minor illnesses, at 21.9%, musculoskeletal problems, at 13.4%, and mental health conditions, at 9.8%.\nCOVID-19 accounted for 24.0% of all occurrences of sickness absence in 2021, up from 13.9% in 2020. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) reported that\u00a0two-thirds of organisations include COVID-19 among the top three reasons of short term absence in 2021.\n\n5.\nGroups with the highest sickness absence rates\nSickness absence rates have been consistently lower for men than for women since 1995, with the rates for both sexes generally falling between 1995 and 2020. Men lost 1.8% of their working hours in 2021 (an increase of 0.3 percentage points from 2020) as a result of sickness or injury and women lost 2.6% of their working hours (an increase of 0.3 percentage points from 2020).\nSickness absence rates are higher among older workers as they are more likely to develop health problems. The rate increased for all age groups from 2020 to 2021. In 2021, the sickness absence rate for those aged 65 years and over was the highest on record (at 3.2%).\n\nIn 2021, as in previous years, workers living in Wales had the highest sickness absence rate (2.8%). Those living in London had the lowest sickness absence rate (1.7%), 0.5 percentage points below the UK average.\nThis can be largely explained by the younger age profile of people and workers living in London and the types of occupations that they do. There is a large concentration of high-skilled jobs in London, which tend to have lower rates of sickness absence.\n\nIn 2021, sickness absence rates for public and private sector workers were 3.0% and 1.9% respectively, both up 0.3 percentage points from their 2020 rates. Sickness absence rates for public sector workers have been consistently higher than those for private sector workers for every year on record.\nThere are several factors to consider when examining the differences between the public and private sectors, including:\nthere are differences in the types of jobs between the sectors, and some jobs have higher likelihoods of sickness than others workers in the private sector are more likely not to be paid sickness absence than those in the public sector\u2028\nthe analysis only counts someone as sick if they work fewer hours than they are contracted for and would exclude someone who makes up lost hours at a later point in the week; individuals in smaller workforces, which are more prominent in the private sector, may be under more pressure to make up any lost hours, but no data are collected on hours made up following sickness absence\u2028\nManagers and senior officials (for example, chief executives and financial managers) had the lowest sickness absence rates in 2021, at 1.1%. Workers in caring, leisure and other service occupations had the highest rates, at 3.8%. Occupational groups will have been affected differently by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the ability to work from home would be very different across these groups. This can be seen in\u00a0our article Which jobs can be done from home?\u00a0published in July 2021.\n\nThe sickness absence rate for part-time workers has been consistently higher than the rate for full-time workers. This can be explained in part by higher numbers of women working part-time, as they also tend to have higher rates of sickness absence. The sickness absence rate for part-time workers was 3.1% in 2021, a 0.5 percentage point increase on the previous year. The sickness absence rate for full-time workers was 2.0% in 2021, an increase of 0.3 percentage points on the previous year.", "summary": "UK sickness absence rate hit 10-year high in 2021\nThe sickness absence rate (or the percentage of working hours lost because of sickness or injury) in the UK labour market rose to 2.2% in 2021, up from a record low of 1.8% in 2020. This is the highest sickness absence rate since 2010.\nMeasures in place because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic such as the furlough scheme, increased homeworking, social distancing and shielding reduced sickness absence in 2020, but the gradual removal of these measures and emergence of new COVID-19 variants in 2021 led to absences rising above pre-coronavirus levels.\nAn estimated 149.3 million working days were lost because of sickness or injury in the UK in 2021, equivalent to 4.6 days per worker. \u201cOther\u201d conditions (which include COVID-19) overtook minor illnesses as the most common reason for sickness absence for the first time in 2021, with COVID-19 accounting for 24.0% of all occurrences.\nWorkers in caring, leisure and other service occupations had the highest sickness absence rate in 2021, at 3.8%.\nSickness absence increased in all age groups between 2020 and 2021, with sickness absence among workers aged 65 years and over reaching 3.2%, the highest on record.", "id": 30}, {"document": "Patterns of crime over the last two years have been substantially affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and government restrictions on social contact. While periods of national lockdown have seen decreases in the incidence of many types of crime, fraud and computer misuse offences have not followed a lockdown-related pattern and have increased substantially.\nSince restrictions were lifted following the third national lockdown in early 2021, police recorded crime data show indications that certain offence types are returning to or exceeding the levels seen before the pandemic. While violence and sexual offences recorded by the police have exceeded pre-pandemic levels, theft offences and robbery remain at a lower level despite increases over the last nine months.\nOverall, Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) estimates provide the best indicator of long-term trends in crime.

The starts dates for this analysis relate to when the survey started, which is different for each country, and the analysis goes up to 11 February 2022. Therefore, the time periods covered are:\n27 April 2020 to 11 February 2022 for England\u2028\n30 June 2020 to 11 February 2022 for Wales\u2028\n27 July 2020 to 11 February 2022 for Northern Ireland\u2028\n22 September 2020 to 11 February 2022 for Scotland\u2028\nIn epidemiology, daily prevalence is the number of people with an infection on a given day, while incidence is the number of people newly infected on a given day. In the survey, we estimate both the number of people in the population who would test positive on a nose and throat swab (positivity) and the number of people who would be newly positive on a nose and throat swab each day (incidence). We do this using both positive and negative swab results.\nPositivity refers to the proportion or number of people who would test positive on any given day if we sampled the whole population. Positivity is not the true number infected on a given day, it is those testing positive on a given day. To calculate the true number of people infected on a given day (prevalence), we would need an accurate understanding of the swab\u00a0test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nTo estimate how many people have had at least one COVID-19 infection we need to first estimate the number of people who would test positive for the first time on any given day and then aggregate this over time. We first estimate the daily proportion of the population who would test positive with their first known COVID-19 infection (if they were tested).

The article uses a statistical model to examine which characteristics of people sampled in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) are associated with those who did and did not report having received a third vaccination against COVID-19 of those who were eligible.\nEligibility for receiving a third vaccination was defined as those adults who had received their second vaccination at least three months ago. This was defined as three 28-day periods; 84 days. Adults who had not received any vaccinations, or had received only one vaccination or a second vaccination within the previous three months were not eligible and have not been included in this analysis.\nThose eligible for a third vaccination and vaccination rates differed considerably by age, mainly because of first and second vaccinations occurring at different times in different age groups. Adults are now only eligible for a third vaccination if their second vaccination was at least three months ago, but this has also varied over time, being initially six months.

Experimental Statistics.\nBack to table of contents\n3.\nGlossary\nSelf-isolation\nSelf-isolation refers to not leaving your home because you have, or might have, coronavirus (COVID-19). As of 24 February 2022, it is no longer a legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive for COVID-19. Respondents in this survey tested positive after this policy change and were therefore not legally required to self-isolate.\nUntil 1 April 2022, adults and children who tested positive continued to be advised to stay home and avoid contact with other people for at least five full days, and to follow the guidance until after receiving two negative test results on consecutive days. When self-isolating, people were advised not to have visitors unless the purpose of the visit was to provide essential care. At the time of data collection, the self-isolation period included the day symptoms started (or the day of receiving the positive test result if there were no symptoms) and the next 5 to 10 full days. If symptoms remained after 10 days, people were advised to continue self-isolating until their symptoms were gone.\nMore information can be found in the\u00a0NHS guidance on what to do if you have coronavirus (COVID-19) or symptoms of COVID-19.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms that indicate an individual should self-isolate prior to a positive test result are a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste.\nSymptoms reported by respondents that do not indicate self-isolation if experienced without a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste are:\nshortness of breath or trouble breathing\nrunny or stuffy nose\nmuscle or body aches\nheadaches\nsore throat\nfatigue\nvomiting\ndiarrhoea\nsevere stomach pain\nFrom 1 April 2022,\u00a0NHS England published an updated list of COVID-19 symptoms. They advised that individuals should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if they had symptoms of COVID-19; these were a high temperature or not feeling well enough to work or do normal activities. This change happened after the data collection period.\nStatistical significance\nThe term \"significant\" refers to statistically significant changes or differences. Significance has been determined using the 95% confidence intervals, where instances of non-overlapping confidence intervals between estimates indicate the difference is unlikely to have arisen from random fluctuation. More information is available on our\u00a0uncertainty pages.\nBack to table of contents\n4.\nMeasuring the data\nEstimates for Wave 13\nThis is the 13th bulletin in this series. The 13th wave of data was collected between 17 and 26 March 2022. The number of respondents was 1,286.\nFollowing the\u00a0Prime Minister's announcement that contact tracing would cease from 24 February 2022, the data source used for sampling in Wave 13 is different from previous waves. Earlier waves contained data collected as part of the\u00a0NHS Test and Trace contract tracing process, whereas the database used for Wave 13 contained only information collected at the time of registering a positive test. Respondents were sampled from this database using implicit stratification by region, sex, and age. The characteristics of people taking coronavirus (COVID-19) tests have also likely changed. Since 24 February 2022, close contacts are no longer informed by the contact tracing system that they may be infected; this will likely change test-taking behaviour in different demographic groups.\nRespondents were aged 18 years and over, had tested positive for COVID-19 on either 10, 13 or 18 March 2022. The survey was conducted via the telephone and all answers were self-reported.\nThe majority (91%) of respondents were interviewed between 6 and 10 days after starting their self-isolation. The remaining 9% of respondents were interviewed between 11 and 15 days after starting their self-isolation.\nOf the potential respondents who were successfully contacted by an interviewer, the response rate was 77.5%. When including cases where contact was attempted but not made, the response rate was 19.8%.\nA low response rate can be expected because the target population may have been unwell with COVID-19, and therefore less likely to participate.\nPercentages in this report are based on weighted counts that are representative of the population of adults (aged 18 years and over) who had tested positive for COVID-19 and began their self-isolation period between 15 February and 15 March 2022 (inclusive).\nExperimental statistics\nThe statistics presented are Experimental Statistics, so care needs to be taken when interpreting them.

It is an update to\u00a0our Deaths from suicide that occurred in England and Wales: April to July 2020 article. We use the National Statistics definition of suicide in this article; see the\u00a0Glossary\u00a0for more information. Unlike\u00a0our annual Suicides in England and Wales bulletin, this is based on the date the death occurred.\n!\nStatistics on suicide are based on the date the death occurred. Because of late death registration, figures are subject to change and should be interpreted with caution. Users should bear in mind the strengths and limitations outlined in Section 4.\nThere is concern over how the coronavirus pandemic has affected well-being and suicide risk (for more information, see the\u00a0Samaritans One year on: data on COVID-19 report). We aim to contribute to existing evidence and to inform decision-making and policy monitoring of suicide prevention in England and Wales, based on the best available provisional data.\nUntil now, it has not been feasible to provide insights into suicides that occurred during the coronavirus pandemic period because of death registration delays. In the past five years, median death registration delays from suicide have been no more than 166 days in England and 165 days in Wales, as shown in\u00a0our Suicides in England and Wales: 2020 registrations bulletin. We focus on deaths between April and December 2020, for deaths registered up to 5 March 2022, the most complete period.\nMost suicides in this period will now be registered, even when allowing for disruption to coroners' inquests. The coronavirus pandemic's impact on suicide registrations was relatively short-term (see\u00a0Section 4), as shown in\u00a0our latest Quarterly suicide death registrations in England bulletin. We have restricted this analysis to the end of December 2020 because data in subsequent months are not sufficiently complete.\nBack to table of contents\n3.\nSuicides occurring between April and December 2020\nThere were 3,828 suicides between April and December 2020 in England and Wales. This was 9.2% less than the corresponding 2019 period when there were 4,215 suicides, and 4.7% less than the five-year average of 4,016 suicides.\nAround three-quarters of suicide deaths between April and December 2020 were among males (2,832 deaths, 74.0%).\nThere is no evidence that the number of suicides increased between April and December 2020 during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\nBetween April and December 2020, the age-standardised suicide rate was 9.8 deaths per 100,000 people. This was statistically significantly lower than the same period between 2018 and 2019. However, the April to December 2020 suicide rate was not significantly different to 2017.\nThe lower suicide rate for April to December 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in male suicides. Male suicide rates were significantly lower during this period (14.8 deaths per 100,000 males) compared with the same periods between 2018 and 2019. Female rates during the same 2020 period (5.0 deaths per 100,000 females) showed no\u00a0statistically significant\u00a0changes.\nBy English region, rates decreased significantly in April to December 2020 in the East of England, compared with the same period between 2017 and 2018.

Rates were lower in each month from September to December 2020 compared with the corresponding month in 2019. However, none of these were statistically significant.\nSome of the reduction in suicides, particularly in the final months of 2020, will be explained by death registration delays.

There was initially an easing in the annual rate of total lending to individuals \u2013 further details on\u00a0total lending to individuals' data\u00a0are provided by the Bank of England. However, following the start of the coronavirus pandemic, this has since recovered to above its pre-coronavirus rates.\nIn contrast, between 2008 and 2009, households sharply reduced their borrowing, as the impact on the cost and availability of finance had an effect on the demand and supply of loans. This was particularly evident in the large decline in the acquisition of mortgage loans in 2008, which have not recovered to their pre-2008 levels (Figure 2).\nMore recently, there has been a rise in household loans secured on dwellings. This might reflect a change in consumer preferences in response to the coronavirus pandemic, as the increase in housing transactions captures there being more value in having larger living spaces outside of cities. The swift rebound in secured lending is also likely to have been boosted by policies such as a\u00a0break in stamp duty tax for property purchases.\n\nThe change in consumer credit following the coronavirus pandemic shows a more pronounced impact than secured lending. Following the coronavirus pandemic, all types of consumer credit lending saw a sharp fall, in particular lending on credit cards. One factor might be the build-up in household savings, which may have reduced their need for raising external finance through consumer credit. Households might have also used these additional savings to repay existing consumer credit loans.\nIn recent months, there has been a sharp rise in cost and price inflationary pressures. The impact of the squeeze on real incomes will, in part, depend on the response of households, such as if there will be a faster run down of any accumulated savings to smooth consumption over time.\nThe May 2022\u00a0Bank of England Monetary Policy Report (PDF, 4,092 KB)\u00a0shows that households might save less and use existing savings to pay for extra spending because of higher inflation. Similarly, the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey found that since November 2021, the proportion of adults who think they would not be able to save any money in the next 12 months has gradually risen. This figure was 45% in May 2022 compared with 34% in November 2021, as detailed in\u00a0our Public opinions and social trends, Great Britain: 25 May to 5 June 2022 bulletin. This also shows that 21% of adults reported using their savings in response to higher living costs.\nIn recent months, there has been a rise in consumer credit, with an increase in credit card lending of 10.6% on the year in March 2022 (Figure 3), reversing the falling trend in consumer credit in 2020 and 2021. Consumer credit lending is more concentrated among lower income workers who were more likely to have seen a fall in their incomes earlier in the coronavirus pandemic, according to the\u00a0Bank of England\u2019s Household debt and Covid bulletin. The latest rise in consumer credit might be boosted by cheaper credit.\u00a0The Bank of England\u2019s Money and Credit \u2013 March 2022 report\u00a0shows that the cost of credit card borrowing was 18.0% in March 2022, 54 basis points below the February 2020 level.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS\u2019s) Opinions and Lifestyle Survey found that 14% of adults reported using credit more than usual in response to higher cost of living in May 2022.

The data report the labour productivity performance levels of UK regions relative to the overall UK. Our headline measure of productivity is output per hour worked. This article is based on output for the year 2020, as reported in\u00a0the most recent annual estimates of economic activity by UK country, region and local area.\nLondon had the highest productivity level of any UK region in 2020, with output per hour more than 50% higher than the median region, maintaining its relative strength, which can be observed in every year\u2019s data since before 1998. Output per hour worked levels for the South East, Scotland and the East of England were also above the median. Northern Ireland had the lowest level of output per hour worked in the UK \u2013 5.2% below the median.\n\nOutput per job is an alternative measure of labour productivity and can produce different results if average hour worked per job varies across regions, reflecting different part-time and full-time working patterns. Across the UK, many workers were furloughed for much of 2020, which generally reduced levels of\u00a0output per job. Figure 2 shows the levels of output per job observed in each region compared with the median across regions. Output per job levels in London, the South East and Scotland were significantly higher than the UK median level in 2020. \u00a0However, Northern Ireland performs noticeably stronger on this metric, where it is above the UK median, than it does using the output per hour measure, where it is noticeably below the UK median. Conversely, the South West has moved in the opposite direction.\n\nFigure 3 shows how regions and devolved nations compared with UK output per hour in 1998 and in 2020.

This is the first monthly decrease since October 2021 (fall of 0.9%) following five consecutive months of growth.\u00a0It should also be noted that the monthly decrease in April 2022 is coming off the record monthly level of \u00a314,994 million in March 2022.\nDespite the monthly fall, construction output was still 3.3% above its pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic level (February 2020) in April 2022 (Figure 8).\u00a0\nThe decrease in monthly construction output in April 2022 was driven by a fall in repair and maintenance (2.4%), which was offset slightly by a rise in new work (0.9%). Most notably, the fall in repair and maintenance work in April 2022 is partly a by-product of the growth (3.0%) in March 2022. This is because demand was strong on account of the repair work experienced from the\u00a0storms experienced in the latter half of February 2022 (PDF, 114KB).\nAt the sector level, 4 of the 9 sectors saw a decrease on the month in April 2022. Private housing repair and maintenance (6.5%) and private commercial new work (3.8%) were the main contributors to the decrease.\u00a0\n\nFigure 8: Construction output decreased by 0.4% in April 2022 and is now 3.3% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level (February 2020)\nMonthly index, UK, February 2020 to April 2022, chained volume measure, seasonally adjusted, Great Britain\nAll work\nAll repair and maintenance\nAll new work\nApr-22\nFeb-22\nDec-21\nOct-21\nAug-21\nJun-21\nApr-21\nFeb-21\nDec-20\nOct-20\nAug-20\nJun-20\nApr-20\nFeb-20\n0\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\nIndex, February 2020 = 100\nSource: Office for National Statistics - GDP monthly estimate and Construction output in Great Britain\nNotes:\nIndexes are rounded to one decimal place.\u2028\nConstruction indexes in this release may differ slightly, because of rounding, to those published in Construction output in Great Britain: April 2022.\u2028\nDownload this chart\nFigure 8: Construction output decreased by 0.4% in April 2022 and is now 3.3% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level (February 2020)\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\nConstruction output rose 2.9% in the three months to April 2022.

However, it is often difficult to quantify these effects.\nMany respondents reported that increases in the cost of production had affected their business. Of those that specified how the cost of production had increased, many explained that the cost of petrol and diesel had some kind of effect, either because they had to pay more for inputs or because they had to raise the price of the products they sold. Other respondents also reported that large increases in utility bills, particularly for gas and electricity, had affected them. Some respondents reported price rises to other inputs such as animal feed, chemicals, aluminium, steel, cooking oil and fertiliser. Other respondents reported difficulties in sourcing machinery, electronic components, kitchen appliances, and wire harnesses for cars.\n", "summary": "UK GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.3% in April 2022\nGross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.3% in April 2022, after a decline of 0.1% in March 2022.\n\nServices fell by 0.3% in April 2022 and was the largest contributor to that month\u2019s fall in GDP.

As a result,\u00a0our EU to Great Britain import statistics\u00a0from January 2022 are not directly comparable with previous months.\nThe move from the Intrastat survey to custom declarations data for imports to Great Britain from the EU marks an improvement in coverage, as trade that previously fell below the Intrastat value threshold (estimated at around 7% of trade by value) is now included, while previously this was estimated. Additionally, customs declarations include trade movements conducted by non-Value Added Tax (VAT)-registered businesses, private individuals, and parcel post, which was not previously captured. For the first quarter of 2022, HMRC has estimated this to be in the region of \u00a30.5 billion a month. HMRC is investigating the scale of other aspects of the transition from the Intrastat survey to customs declarations data, by evaluating the importer population in both datasets, to assess whether they represent a time series break between 2022 and previous years.\nOngoing analysis confirms strong imports of machinery and transport equipment from the EU in 2022, reflecting a recovery following lower levels throughout much of 2021. HMRC is continuing to assess any impacts of this change and drivers of the current import trends.\u00a0\nWe advise caution when interpreting 2022 EU imports compared with other periods because of the change in data collection from the Intrastat survey in 2021 to customs declarations in 2022.\nBack to table of contents\n3.\nMain trends\nThe UK leaving the EU and the subsequent transition period, along with the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, global recession and supply chain disruption, have caused higher levels of volatility in trade statistics in the past two years. It continues to be difficult to assess the extent to which trade movements reflect short-term trade disruption or longer-term supply chain adjustments.\nUnless otherwise specified, data within this bulletin are in current prices. This means they have not been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation. We also publish statistics in\u00a0chained volume measures (CVM)\u00a0to help evaluate pricing impacts.\nThis section looks at the main trends in imports and exports firstly on a month-on-month, three-month-on-three-month and then annual basis. \u00a0The monthly analysis shows short-term trade movements, but it is important to note monthly data are erratic and therefore small movements should be treated with caution.

Of the divisions putting upward pressure on the 12-month rate, three divisions \u2013 housing and household services, restaurants and hotels, and recreation and culture \u2013 added 0.1 percentage points or more to the rate.\nHousing and household services\nThe largest upward contribution to the change in the CPIH 12-month inflation rate came from housing and household services. In April 2022, the contribution to the annual rate from this division increased by 1.27 percentage points, more than 1 percentage point bigger than any other contribution to the change in the CPIH rate in April. This is the largest contribution to change from any division since the start of the National Statistic series in January 2006.\nThe effect came predominantly from electricity, gas and other fuels, which added 1.21 percentage points to the annual rate. A further 0.02 percentage points came from water and sewerage services. On average, energy prices rose by 46.5% on the month, compared with a smaller rise of 8.3% a year earlier. More specifically, the price of electricity rose 40.5% on the month, and the price of gas rose 66.8%. This reflects the increase in the Ofgem price cap, which changed on 1 April 2022.\nUpward contributions to change from rents and owner occupiers' housing costs (OOH) were partially offset by downward pressure from Council Tax and rates. OOH, and Council Tax and rates, are the components of CPIH that are not included in CPI. These contributions are therefore discussed in more detail in\u00a0section 5.\nRestaurants and hotels\nThere was also a large upward contribution to change (of 0.11 percentage points) from restaurants and hotels. Overall, prices rose by 1.7% between March and April 2022, compared with 0.7% a year earlier. The upward effect came largely from restaurants, cafes and dancing establishments, where all items in the basket increased in price. This is consistent with the increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) from 12.5% to 20% on 1 April 2022. VAT was lowered to 5% for the hospitality sector alongside the August 2020 Eat Out to Help Out Scheme, and remained at 5% until 1 October 2021, when it was increased to 12.5%. The most recent change returns VAT for the hospitality sector to the rate that was in place before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. By comparison, between April 2020 and April 2022, restaurant and caf\u00e9 prices have grown by 8.4%.\nHowever, it should be noted that many items within this division were imputed in April 2021 because of lockdowns that were in place across the UK. Unavailable items were imputed as described in our\u00a0Coronavirus and the effects on UK prices article. This means that monthly movements for those items in 2021 reflect imputed index movements and should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.\nRecreation and culture\nA further large upward contribution to the change in the CPIH 12-month inflation rate came from recreation and culture, increasing the rate by 0.10 percentage points between March and April 2022. Games, toys and hobbies contributed 0.14 percentage points to the change in the rate where overall prices fell by 1.0% between March and April 2022. This is compared with a larger fall of 7.2% between the same two months a year earlier. The movements largely reflect price changes for computer games, which can sometimes be large, in part depending on the composition of bestseller charts. Therefore, short-term movements need to be interpreted with caution. There was a partially offsetting downward contribution to change from recording media of 0.03 percentage points. Here prices fell this year but rose a year ago. Again, price movements for recording media items can be influenced by the contents of bestseller charts.\nThere were also small offsetting contributions to change in other areas of the recreation and culture basket.

We are looking at options to improve this, including working with data suppliers.\nIn particular, HMLR has been increasing the level of automation in the way they process applications. As a result of this process, initial data numbers may be lower than pre-coronavirus pandemic transaction volumes; however, in the medium to long term, this will lead to higher volumes being processed.\nThe total number of processed transactions feeding into this month\u2019s release (including those from previous months, which are incorporated in line with our revisions policy) has increased compared with the numbers seen throughout the coronavirus pandemic period. While this indicates an improvement in the quality of the UK HPI estimates going forward, it may also result in revisions to previous months that are higher than usual, as more transactions are now available in our calculations. Further information on this can be found in\u00a0Section 7: Measuring the data.\n\nThe latter half of 2020 saw the UK\u2019s average house price growth accelerating. This trend continued into 2021 and house price growth has remained strong since the start of 2022; the UK average house price for March 2022 was \u00a3278,000, unchanged from the record level seen in February 2022.\nOn 8 July 2020, changes to the tax paid on property purchases were announced with immediate effect in England and Northern Ireland. Similar changes came into effect slightly later in Scotland and Wales (15 July and 27 July, respectively). In England and Northern Ireland, properties up to the value of \u00a3500,000 would incur no tax, while the thresholds for Scotland and Wales were \u00a3250,000. These changes in the tax paid on housing transactions may have allowed sellers to request higher prices as the buyers\u2019 overall costs were reduced.\nOn 3 March 2021, an extension to the Stamp Duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland was announced. This meant that the tax holiday was extended until 30 June 2021, after which the threshold decreased to \u00a3250,000 until 30 September 2021. From 1 October 2021, the Stamp Duty thresholds have reverted to what they were before 8 July 2020. The tax holiday for Scotland ended on 31 March 2021. The tax holiday for Wales ended on 30 June 2021.\nAs the tax breaks were originally due to conclude at the end of March 2021, it is likely that March\u2019s average house prices were slightly inflated as buyers rushed to ensure their house purchases were scheduled to complete ahead of this deadline. This effect was then further exaggerated in June 2021 in line with the extension to the holiday on taxes paid on property purchases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They could be seen again in September 2021 when the last of the tax holidays came to an end in England. An increase in prices since then has resulted in a record average house price level in the UK of \u00a3278,000 in March 2022.\nThe provisional seasonally adjusted estimate of UK residential transactions in March 2022 was 114,650, as shown in the\u00a0Monthly property transactions statistics published by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

This affects the rest of the expenditure distribution, in that there are only two other categories where private renters spend a greater share of expenditure than owner-occupiers. These are education, and alcoholic beverages and tobacco, and the differences are small.\nInflation experience\n\nFigure 2: Owner occupiers\u2019 inflation rate in the latter half of 2021 has been higher than that of renters\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\nFrom May 2020, owner occupiers experienced the slowest inflation of all tenure types, and between August 2020 and March 2021, they experienced negative inflation. This was driven by owner occupiers' housing costs. These fell because of changes to the tax paid [note 1] on housing transactions in July 2020 and because of mortgage interest payments decreasing. This followed the Bank of England's cut to the UK's interest rate from 0.75% to 0.25% on 11 March 2020, which was then further cut to 0.1% on 19 March 2020.\nSubsequently, from July 2021 onwards, owner occupiers have witnessed higher inflation than other tenure types. This is partly driven by the slowdown and eventual removal of the changes in the tax paid on property transactions. However, this is slightly offset by increases in actual rentals for housing. The difference between owner occupiers' and private renters' inflation rate is also partly driven by increases in transport costs, which owner-occupier households spend a larger proportion of their expenditure on.\nFigure 3: Housing and transport costs have driven owner occupiers\u2019 inflation rate above private renters\u2019 in the second half of 2021\nImage\u00a0.csv\u00a0.xls\nIncome\nCare should be taken when interpreting income charts; please see\u00a0Section 7: Measuring the data\u00a0for more information.\nComparing income changes to inflation changes for tenure groups results in a mixed picture. Owner occupiers saw a 10.7% increase to their income between the financial year ending (FYE) 2020 and FYE 2021, while they saw a negative 0.1% growth to inflation. In comparison, private renters saw a spike to their income in FYE 2020 (growth of 11.6%) before falling in FYE 2021 (decrease of 7.1%).\nFigure 4 : Private renters are the only tenure group to see their income fall in FYE 2021\nMean equivalised household disposable income (nominal) and Household Costs Indices cumulative growth for subsidised renters, private renters and owner-occupiers, UK, financial years ending 2006 to 2021\n\nBetween FYE 2006 and FYE 2021, subsidised renters have seen a 48.6% increase in their incomes from a base of \u00a315,424 in FYE 2006, alongside a 47.3% increase in their costs. Private renters\u2019 incomes have grown by 52.6% from a base of \u00a322,202 compared with a 37.8% increase in costs. Owner occupiers\u2019 incomes have grown by 52.5% from a base of \u00a329,058 against cost increases of 38.7%.\nNotes for: Households of varying tenure types\nOn 8 July 2020, changes to the tax paid on property purchases were announced with immediate effect in England and Northern Ireland. Similar changes came into effect slightly later in Scotland and Wales (15 July 2020 and 27 July 2020, respectively). In England and Northern Ireland, properties up to the value of \u00a3500,000 would incur no tax, while the thresholds for Scotland and Wales were \u00a3250,000. These changes in the tax paid on housing transactions meant buyers' overall costs were reduced.\nOn 3 March 2021, an extension to the Stamp Duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland was announced. This meant that the tax holiday was extended until 30 June 2021, after which the threshold decreased to \u00a3250,000 until 30 September 2021. From 1 October 2021, the Stamp Duty thresholds have reverted to what they were before 8 July 2020. The tax holiday for Scotland ended on 31 March 2021. The tax holiday for Wales ended on 30 June 2021.\nBack to table of contents\n3.\nLow-income and high-income households\nWe describe low-income households as those within the second income decile, and high-income households as those within the ninth income decile.

Higher-income households spend a greater proportion of their expenditure on transport, and so increases in transport costs have had a greater impact on this household group. Hotels, restaurants and package holidays have also contributed to the difference in inflation rate between high-income and low-income households.\nLow-income households' experience of inflation in the latter half of 2021 has been driven by rising prices in food, drinks and tobacco, and utilities and domestic fuel (electricity and gas prices), which low-income households spend a higher proportion of their expenditure on.\nHousing and Council Tax costs contributed towards low-income households seeing a slightly higher inflation rate in the latter half of 2020. It also contributes to high-income households experiencing higher growth rates in the latter half of 2021. This is being driven by changes to the tax paid on property transactions.\nIncome\nIn the financial year ending (FYE) 2021, both low-income and high-income households are experiencing a faster growth in income in comparison to costs. Low-income households have experienced a 6.0% increase in their income between FYE 2020 and FYE 2021, while high-income households experienced a 2.3% increase.
