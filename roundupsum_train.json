This could be evidence of fraudsters taking advantage of a switch in behaviour, such as an increase in shopping online.\nThe survey also revealed an 89% increase in computer misuse offences such as hacking compared with the year ending September 2019.

we spent less time on indoor activities and more on outdoor activities and socialising in person, according to new analysis of Time Use Survey data.\nThe behavioural changes over this period were largely related to changes in government restrictions and adapting to living in a pandemic, even when factoring in whether someone had a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine dose by March 2021; for example, those without a vaccine spent 10 more minutes socialising, while those who received a vaccine spent 7 more minutes socialising.\nThe main difference in changes in behaviour from 12 months ago between those with or without a vaccine dose were in changes to time spent working, explained by differences in age and occupation.\nAmong the non-vaccinated (more likely to be younger and employed in jobs outside of healthcare) there was an increase in time spent working, whereas there was little change for people with at least one vaccine dose.\nWhile most home-based activities shifted back closer to patterns seen before the pandemic (such as watching less TV), we spent more time working from home compared with the first lockdown.\nLonger hours spent working may explain why non-vaccinated people were sleeping about 35 minutes less than in the first lockdown; in comparison, those who had received a vaccine slept for a similar amount of time but spent more time resting, possibly as they were recovering from their vaccine.\nThe impact of schools reopening coincided with the time parents spent on childcare decreasing by over 30%, which appeared to free up more time for working; this change particularly applied to those who had not yet received a vaccine, who were more likely to be parents.\nThe gender gap in unpaid work was smaller than it was before the start of the pandemic but was still substantial; in March 2021, women spent an average of 56 minutes more time per day on unpaid household work than men.\n", "summary": "Behaviour changes after a year of lockdowns not greatly affected by vaccine status\nThe way we live our lives changed considerably after a year of coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns, but whether we had a vaccine dose appears to have had little impact on our behaviour, according to new analysis. \nLongitudinal time-use survey data collected in March and April 2020, and in March 2021, reveal significant changes in behaviour, with more time spent on outdoor activities such as socialising, more homeworking, and less sleep. \nBy March of this year, around 30 million people in the UK had received their first vaccine dose, including 92% of those aged 50 years and over. \nHowever, any differences in behaviour identified between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups at this time appear to have been driven by age or occupation rather than lifestyle changes caused by having had a vaccine dose. \nThose who had not received a vaccine \u2013 more likely to be younger and employed outside of healthcare \u2013 were working an average of an hour more than they were a year earlier, with little change seen in the vaccinated group. \nGeneral changes in behaviour were more likely to be driven by changes in government policy and adapting to living in a pandemic, regardless of vaccine status. \nFor example, those without a vaccine spent 10 more minutes socialising, while those who received a vaccine spent seven more minutes socialising. \n - Read the full analysis of how people spent their time - one year on from the first UK lockdown: Great Britain, March 2021\n", "id": 266}, {"document": "Retail sales volumes declined by 1.4% between April and May 2021 following a sharp increase in April when retail restrictions were eased;

Of employees recorded as disabled, as measured by the Government Statistical Service, in the period July to November 2020, 21.1 per thousand were made redundant, compared with 13.0 per thousand of employees who were not disabled. \nWith the closure of non-essential retail and hospitality alongside other restrictions to businesses, 71% of the redundancies in the period July to November 2020 were attributed by LFS respondents to employers cutting staff because of a loss of trade. The remaining proportion were equally attributed to either \u201cemployer closing down\u201d or \u201cother reasons\u201d. Both coronavirus and EU exit-related uncertainties may have caused some employers to reduce staff.\nBetween July and November 2020, the industry with the highest redundancy rate was the administrative and support services industry (35.8 per thousand), followed by the \u201cother services\u201d industry group, which includes arts, entertainment and recreation (30.5 per thousand).
