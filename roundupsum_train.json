during the early months of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, until now not feasible because of death registration delays.\n1,603 suicides occurred between April and July 2020 in England and Wales,

than rates for the same period in the previous three years, however, is statistically similar to the rate in 2016.\nThe lower suicide rate was primarily driven by a decrease for males; the male suicide rate (13.9 deaths per 100,000 males) was statistically significantly lower than rates in the same period between 2017 and 2019, whereas the female rate (4.7 deaths per 100,000 females) showed no statistically significant change with earlier years.\nBetween April and July 2020, age-specific suicide rates in England and Wales statistically significantly decreased for those aged 10 to 24 years and 25 to 44 years, when compared with the same period in 2019\nThese statistics are consistent with other research including real-time suicide surveillance in England and international research studies during the pandemic.\nDeaths caused by suicide in England and Wales are investigated by coroners, resulting in registration delays; while these provisional data for 2020 suicides will be

This is 1,433 fewer deaths than the mean for the period 2015 to 2019 in Week 25, and a decrease of 950 deaths from the Week 24 2021 estimate of 8,730 (confidence interval: 8,461 to 9,062).\nThese are provisional estimates that assume that the pattern of occurrences can be predicted based on experience in previous years. The estimate for the most recent week always has a wider margin of error than for earlier weeks, so it should be treated with caution.\nDownload the data\nAnalysis in this section includes deaths from Week 11 of 2020 (week ending 13 March 2020, the week of the first registration of a death involving COVID-19) through to Week 25 of 2021 (week ending 25 June 2021), to ensure full coverage of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nUsing the most up-to-date data we have available, the number of deaths from the week ending 13 March 2020 up to 25 June 2021 was 792,806 in England and Wales. Of these, 140,560 (17.7%) mentioned COVID-19 on the death certificate. During this period, the number of excess deaths above the five-year average was 103,421 deaths.\nIn England, the number of deaths between the weeks ending 13 March 2020 and 25 June 2021 was 743,565; of these, 132,475 deaths (17.8%) mentioned COVID-19. This was 99,553 deaths above the five-year average.\nIn Wales, the number of deaths for the same period was 48,277; of these, 7,900 deaths (16.4%) mentioned COVID-19. This was 4,896 deaths above the five-year average.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

The largest increase was reported in the North West (12 more deaths). More detailed geographical analysis can be found in our\u00a0Monthly mortality analysis release.\nBetween Weeks 24 and 25, the number of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) increased in private homes (5 more) and decreased in care homes (7 fewer) and other communal establishments (1 fewer). There was no change in the number of deaths involving COVID-19 in hospitals, hospices and elsewhere. Deaths involving COVID-19 in hospitals as a proportion of all deaths in hospitals increased to 2.0% in Week 25 (1.8% in Week 24). Deaths involving COVID-19 in care homes accounted for 0.5% of all deaths in care homes.\nDetailed analysis on deaths of care home residents is available in\u00a0Deaths involving COVID-19 in the care sector, England and Wales: deaths registered between week ending 20 March 2020 and week ending 2 April 2021.\nFrom Week 1 2021 (week ending 8 January 2021) onwards, we have published a\u00a0dataset of weekly deaths of care home residents.\nAs well as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) provides numbers of deaths involving COVID-19 in care homes in England that are based on the date the death was notified to the CQC. From 10 April 2020 (the first day when data were collected using the CQC's new method of identifying deaths involving COVID-19) to 2 July 2021, there were 29,467 deaths of residents in care homes involving COVID-19. Of these deaths, 18 were notified in the week up to 2 July 2021. More information on the data provided by the CQC can be found in our\u00a0joint transparency statement.\nIn Wales, the Welsh Government publishes the\u00a0number of deaths of care home residents involving COVID-19\u00a0notified to the Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW). Between 1 March 2020 and 16 June 2021, there were 1,922 deaths of residents in care homes involving COVID-19.\nDownload the data\nIn Week 25, the number of deaths in private homes was 24.0% above the five-year average (538 excess deaths). Deaths within care homes were 19.2% below the five-year average (382 deaths fewer), deaths in hospitals were 17.7% below the five-year average (776 deaths fewer) and deaths in other settings were 11.8% below the five-year average (94 deaths fewer).\nIn addition, more\u00a0detailed analysis of excess deaths in England\u00a0is produced by Public Health England (PHE) on a weekly basis.\nFigure 7 is based on date of death for deaths registered up to 3 July 2021, rather than date of registration. As more deaths are registered, deaths per day are likely to increase, especially for later dates. Looking at the number of deaths involving COVID-19 that occurred in Week 25, 81.7% of deaths occurred in hospitals and 8.5% occurred in care homes; this may change as more deaths are registered.\nThe earliest known death involving COVID-19 occurred in the week ending 31 January 2020 (Week 5).\nAcross the UK, there were 10,052 deaths (all causes) registered in Week 25 (week ending 25 June 2021), which was 641 fewer deaths than the UK five-year average, and 773 fewer deaths than in Week 24 (week ending 18 June 2021).\nUsing the most up-to-date data we have available, from the week ending 13 March 2020 up to 25 June 2021, the number of deaths was 898,505. The number of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) was 152,725 and the number of excess deaths above the five-year average was 115,227.\nDeaths were below the five-year average in England (695 fewer deaths) and in Wales (10 fewer deaths). The number of deaths were above the five-year average in Week 25 in Scotland (24 more deaths) and Northern Ireland (49 more deaths). Of all UK deaths, 118 involved COVID-19, 2 more deaths than in Week 24 (1.7% increase) (Figure 8).\nIn Week 25, England had the highest number of deaths involving COVID-19 with 97 deaths, followed by Scotland (17 deaths), Northern Ireland (2 deaths) and Wales (1 death).\nThis section will look at the number of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) by date of death produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) compared with death notifications reported on the\u00a0GOV.UK Coronavirus in the UK dashboard.

This result was similar to the previous survey (93% during 1 to 5 June 2021).\nThe proportion of respondents who did not have contact with a non-household member was higher in the first 24 hours of self-isolation (97%) compared with the rest of the isolation period (93%). Of those who had contact with a non-household member at least once, four in 10 (40%) met two to five non-household members at any one time.\nRespondents were asked about their interpretation of the requirements for self-isolation to determine how well they understood them.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases in the community, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other institutional settings\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 17 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive continued to increase in England and increased in Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the percentage testing positive increased in the two weeks up to 17 July 2021, however, the trend is uncertain in the week ending 17 July 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 100 if over 1,000, to the nearest 10 if under 1,000 and to the nearest 5 if under 100. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0methods article and Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 17 July 2021, the highest percentages of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) were observed in the North East and North West.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 17 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive continued to increase in all regions of England, except the North East and North West. The percentage testing positive increased in the North East and North West in the most recent two weeks up to 17 July 2021, however, the trend is uncertain in the week ending 17 July 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend, particularly in the North East where the credible intervals are wider and therefore uncertainty is higher.\n.XLSX\nWhen the percentage of people testing positive is low, sub-regional estimates are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the credible intervals.\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 11 to 17 July 2021 for sub-regions in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. This week we have not included sub-regional estimates for Wales because further quality assurance is required.\n.XLSX\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 17 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive has increased in all age groups except for those in school Year 7 to school Year 11. The percentage testing positive has increased for those in school Year 7 to school Year 11 in the most recent two weeks up to 17 July 2021; however, the trend is uncertain in the most recent week ending 17 July 2021.\n.XLSX\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these can be found in the following section and datasets that accompany this bulletin.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our accompanying dataset and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 6 June to 17 July 2021. These estimates use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0accompanying dataset. \n\n\n\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is\u00a0published by\u00a0their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\u00a0\nFigure 5 shows the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age from 6 June to 17 July 2021, for each of the four UK countries. Because of lower positivity rates during some of this period, caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n.XLSX\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We regularly review our methods and survey design as part of our ongoing quality assurance process. We have recently completed our review and are now including estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0accompanying datasets.\nOur incidence method uses several weeks' data to provide the latest estimate of new infections. Following our review, we have changed the reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases to 14 days prior to the end of the positivity reference date, with credible intervals provided until 7 days after the incidence reference date. Previously the incidence reference date was 10 days prior to the end of the positivity reference date. This change was necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. Estimates of incidence are therefore not the latest figure as there is a time lag of two weeks between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate.\nWhile we believe that the estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. This is particularly the case with the most recent estimates so it is important to be cautious when using them. When incidence is low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances we recommend focusing on the upper credible interval, which gives an upper bound to the incidence of new infections. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nCredible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results. In the week ending 3 July 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 increased in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the trend is uncertain in the week ending 3 July 2021.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have suggested new names for\u00a0Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest.\nVariants of concern\nAlpha\nVariant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK.\nBeta\nVariant B.1.351, first identified in South Africa.\nGamma\nVariant P.1, first identified in Brazil.\nDelta\nVariant B.1.617.2, first identified in India.\nVariants of interest\nEta\nVariant B.1.525, first identified in Nigeria.\nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of coronavirus (COVID-19) identified in the UK in mid-November 2020 has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative) in our main variant analysis.\nOther variants - including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) - are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group is labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\".\nOur main variant analysis can differentiate between these two groups of variants (ORF1ab+N positive or ORF1ab+S+N positive) but cannot differentiate between variants that have the same gene pattern for the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect. As Delta has been the main variant in the UK for several weeks it is possible that some Delta variant infections do not test positive on the three genes, particularly if there is a low viral load. We expect these numbers to be small, but it is possible that some Delta cases may be categorised as Alpha compatible. More information on individual variants and where they were first detected is available on the\u00a0government variant dashboard.\nOther variants, including Eta (B.1.525), also have the same pattern of gene positivity as Alpha (B.1.1.7). At present these are rare in the UK so we describe this group as compatible with the Alpha variant, but we will continue to keep this under review. The percentage of people testing positive by different variants are provided in the\u00a0accompanying technical dataset.\nSince the end of May, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in England and in recent weeks all four UK countries. In the week ending 17 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive whose results are compatible with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) continued to increase in England and increased in Northern Ireland and Wales. In Scotland, the percentage increased in the two weeks up to 17 July 2021, but the trend is uncertain in the week ending 17 July 2021. Because of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included charts showing breakdown by variant in this bulletin. We will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts when considered helpful.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the technical dataset that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the\u00a0accompanying technical dataset\u00a0using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 11 July 2021, the majority (98%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2) with Alpha (B.1.1.7) comprising most of the remainder (2%) of sequences.\nWe also provide information on viruses where we have found a particular genetic change (mutation) called E484K. This mutation is always seen in Beta (B.1.351).\nLaboratory data suggest that this mutation might make it easier for a virus to infect someone again, or to infect someone who has been vaccinated, but the importance of this mutation in terms of its effect in transmitting the virus is still uncertain.\nThis analysis was produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0methods article\u00a0and our recent\u00a0blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 23 July 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 23 July 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 23 July 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 23 July 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 23 July 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

This was 1,275 fewer deaths than in June 2020 and 310 deaths more than the five-year average (2015 to 2019) (0.8% higher).\nThe five-year average has been provided for 2015 to 2019 (rather than 2016 to 2020) because of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on deaths registered in 2020. The average for 2015 to 2019 provides a comparison of the number of deaths expected in a usual (non-pandemic) year.\nIn Wales, the provisional number of deaths registered in June 2021 was 2,560. This was 132 fewer deaths than in June 2020 and 26 more deaths than the five-year average for June (1.0% higher).\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) are used for comparisons over time rather than numbers of deaths, as ASMRs account for changes to the population size and age structure. In England, mortality rates for the month of June had been generally decreasing since 2004 (the highest mortality rate in this analysis), from 1,170.7 deaths per 100,000 people in 2004, to a low of 814.7 deaths per 100,000 people in June 2019. The\u00a0statistically significant\u00a0decrease in ASMRs from 2004 was seen in both males and females (Figure 1).\nIn England, the June 2021 mortality rate (842.3 deaths per 100,000 people) was significantly lower than June 2020 (886.9 deaths per 100,000 people) but significantly higher than June 2019 (814.7 deaths per 100,000 people).\nIn Wales, mortality rates for June had also been decreasing over time, from 1,222.3 deaths per 100,000 people in 2005 (the highest mortality rate in this analysis), to a low of 854.5 deaths per 100,000 people in June 2019. In June 2021, the mortality rate was 914.1 deaths per 100,000 people; this was lower than June 2020 (980.9 deaths per 100,000 people) but this difference was not statistically significant.\nThe doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death, and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death. Using this information, we determine an underlying cause of death. More information on this process can be found in our\u00a0user guide.\nSince March 2020 (when the first deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) were registered in England and Wales), where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate it was the underlying cause of death in most cases (89.0% in England, 87.4% in Wales). In June 2021, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death for 72.3% of deaths that mentioned COVID-19 on the death certificate in England and 40.0% in Wales. For more information on our definition of COVID-19 deaths, see\u00a0Section 10: Measuring the data.\n\n!\n\nIn this bulletin, we use the term \u201cdue to COVID-19\u201d when referring only to deaths with an underlying cause of death of COVID-19 and we use the term \u201cinvolving COVID-19\u201d when referring to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether as an underlying cause or not. \n\n\n\nOf the 38,611 deaths registered in June 2021 in England, 0.9% (344 deaths) were due to COVID-19, the same proportion as in May 2021. Including all deaths involving COVID-19 (476 deaths) increases the percentage to 1.2% of all deaths in England in June 2021.\nIn Wales, 0.1% of the 2,560 deaths registered in June 2021 were due to COVID-19 (2 deaths); this is the lowest proportion seen during the pandemic. Including all deaths involving COVID-19 (5 deaths) increases the percentage to 0.2% of all deaths in Wales.\nIn England, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 increased by 3.3% compared with May 2021. In Wales, deaths due to COVID-19 continued to decrease by 86.7% compared with May 2021.\nWhen adjusting for the size and age structure of the population, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths due to COVID-19 in England for June 2021 were similar to May 2021. The ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 increased to 7.5 deaths per 100,000 people in June 2021 (compared with 7.1 in May 2021). But, this increase was not statistically significant. In Wales, the number of deaths (2 deaths due to COVID-19) was too small to create a reliable ASMR so these have not been calculated.\nIn June 2021, the ASMRs for deaths due to COVID-19 increased for both males (10.0 per 100,000 males in England) and females (5.6 per 100,000 females in England). More information on mortality rates by sex is available in Tables 3a and 3b of the\u00a0accompanying dataset. For males and females in Wales, there were too few deaths due to COVID-19 for a rate to be calculated.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

The second most common cause of death in June 2021 was dementia and Alzheimer's disease, with 85.8 deaths per 100,000 people in England (3,962 deaths) and 96.8 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales (270 deaths).\nIn England, coronavirus (COVID-19) was the 26th leading cause of death in June 2021 (344 deaths). This is compared with May 2021, where COVID-19 was the 24th leading cause of death in England (333 deaths). In Wales, there were 2 deaths due to COVID-19 in June 2021, so it was not possible to reliably rank COVID-19 compared with other leading causes of death.\nIn England in June 2021, 7 of the 10 leading causes of death were significantly lower than the five-year average (2015 to 2019). As seen in recent months, the mortality rate for deaths with an underlying cause of influenza and pneumonia was 42.7% lower in June 2021 than the five-year average for June; this is likely in part because of coronavirus restrictions and guidance, such as social distancing, reducing the spread of infections such as flu.\nIn Wales, 2 of the 10 leading causes were significantly lower than the five-year average, with all other leading causes for June 2021 having similar mortality rates to the five-year average. Similar to England, the June 2021 mortality rate for influenza and pneumonia was 51.5% lower than the five-year average for June.\nIn the first six months (January to June) of 2021, the leading cause of death in both England and Wales was COVID-19, accounting for 17.3% of all deaths in England and 13.9% of all deaths in Wales. The year-to-date mortality rate for deaths due to COVID-19 was 177.0 deaths per 100,000 people in England and 149.1 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales.\nIn both countries, the year-to-date COVID-19 mortality rate was significantly higher than the next leading cause of death (dementia and Alzheimer's disease in England and ischaemic heart diseases in Wales).\nMore information on the 2021 year-to-date leading causes of death is available in Tables 11a and 11b of the\u00a0accompanying dataset. More in-depth\u00a0analysis of leading causes of death is available in our annual publication based on finalised mortality data, and analysis focusing on COVID-19 in 2020 is available in our deaths due to COVID-19 article.\nThere were 282,754 deaths registered in England and 18,152 in Wales during the first six months (January to June) of 2021.\nTo gain a better idea of year-to-year differences in mortality rates, we calculated year-to-date age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) based on deaths registered in January to June of each year from 2001 to 2021 (Figure 5). For England, the year-to-date age-standardised mortality rate for 2021 was 1,026.0 deaths per 100,000 people, which was\u00a0statistically significantly\u00a0lower than the same period in 2020 (1,151.1 deaths per 100,000 people). However, when compared with the same period in 2019 (949.4 deaths per 100,000 people), the 2021 year-to-date mortality rate was significantly higher.\nFor Wales, the year-to-date age-standardised mortality rate for 2021 was 1,078.1 deaths per 100,000 people. This was statistically significantly lower than the same period in 2020 (1,174.6 deaths per 100,000 people). But, similar to England, January to June 2021 was significantly higher than the same period in 2019 (1,031.4 deaths per 100,000 people).\nThis section is based on the date a death occurred - rather than the date of registration used in the previous sections - to monitor current mortality trends. Further information can be found in Section 10: Measuring the data.\nIn England, 32,057 deaths occurred in June 2021 (and were registered by 7 July). This was 4,793 fewer deaths than the five-year average (2015 to 2019) for June (13.0% lower). Of the 32,057 deaths that occurred, 0.8% were due to coronavirus (COVID-19) (265 deaths).\nIn Wales, 2,244 deaths occurred in June 2021 (and were registered by 7 July), which was 200 fewer deaths than the five-year average (8.2% lower). COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death in 0.1% of all deaths that occurred (2 deaths).\nIn England, the first death due to COVID-19 occurred on 30 January 2020. Figure 6 shows the trend in COVID-19 death occurrences from March 2020 onwards. The largest number of COVID-19 deaths that occurred in a single day in England was on 8 April 2020 (1,225 deaths), followed by 19 January 2021 (1,201 deaths).\nIt is important to note that the number of death occurrences is incomplete as it is likely that more deaths need to be registered, therefore comparisons should be treated with caution.\nIn particular, instances where the number of death occurrences on each day in June was below the range of the last five years are likely to be a result of when the data extract was created. Specifically, deaths that occurred towards the end of the month may not have been registered by the time the data extract was created. We would therefore expect the number of death occurrences to be higher in future releases.\nData on pre-existing conditions of people who died due to coronavirus (COVID-19) in England and Wales for 2021 can be found in the\u00a0accompanying dataset. Detailed information on this analysis is available in the\u00a0April 2021 edition of this bulletin. This analysis will be updated on a quarterly basis in the July edition, but we plan to review the level of detail that can be provided given small numbers of deaths due to COVID-19.\n\nMonthly mortality analysis, England and Wales Dataset | Released 23 July 2021 Monthly data on death registrations and death occurrences in England and Wales, broken down by sex and age.

You can also read our article to find out more about comparing methods used in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace to better understand comparisons in data sources. \nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In institutional settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the coronavirus pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period.\nAll analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nMore information on COVID-19 and taking part in our survey   For more information, please visit the\u00a0CIS participant guidance\u00a0page.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases in the community, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other institutional settings\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 24 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to increase in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, although there are possible signs that the increase in England may have slowed. In Scotland, the percentage testing positive decreased in the week ending 24 July 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 100 if over 1,000, to the nearest 10 if under 1,000 and to the nearest 5 if under 100. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\n\n\n\nDownload the data\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our methods article and Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 24 July 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was observed in the North East of England.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals.\n\n\n\nIn the week ending 24 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive continued to increase in all regions of England, except the East of England and the South West. In the East of England and South West, the percentage testing positive increased in the most recent two weeks, however the trend is uncertain in the most recent week ending 24 July 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nDownload the data\nWhen the percentage of people testing positive is low, sub-regional estimates are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the credible intervals. \n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them.\n\n\n\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 18 to 24 July 2021 for sub-regions in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales is currently not included as it has the lowest number of infections compared with other UK countries so we are undertaking further quality assurance of their sub-regional estimates.\nDownload the data\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11 to 12-year-olds and 16 to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset.\n\n\n\nIn the week ending 24 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive has increased for those aged two years to School Year 11, and those aged over 50 years. The percentage testing positive has increased for those aged between School Year 12 and 49 years in the most recent two weeks, up to 24 July 2021. However, the trends are uncertain in the most recent week ending 24 July 2021. \nDownload the data\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these can be found in the following section and datasets that accompany this bulletin.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our accompanying dataset and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 13 June to 22 July 2021. These estimates use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset.\n\n\n\nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh. \nFigure 5 shows the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age from 13 June to 22 July 2021, for each of the four UK countries. Because of lower positivity rates during some of this period, caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\nDownload the data\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We regularly review our methods and survey design as part of our ongoing quality assurance process. We have recently completed our review and are now including estimates of the incidence rate in our accompanying datasets.\nOur incidence method uses several weeks' data to provide the latest estimate of new infections. Following our review, we have changed the reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases to 14 days prior to the end of the positivity reference date, with credible intervals provided until 7 days after the incidence reference date. Previously the incidence reference date was 10 days prior to the end of the positivity reference date. This change was necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. Estimates of incidence are therefore not the latest figure as there is a time lag of two weeks between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate.\nWhile we believe that the estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. This is particularly the case with the most recent estimates so it is important to be cautious when using them. When incidence is low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances we recommend focusing on the upper credible interval, which gives an upper bound to the incidence of new infections. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nCredible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results. In the week ending 10 July 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases increased in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, whilst in Scotland, the rate appears to have decreased. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest.\nVariant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK.\nVariant B.1.351, first identified in South Africa.\nVariant P.1, first identified in Brazil.\nVariant B.1.617.2, first identified in India.\nVariant B.1.525, first identified in Nigeria.\nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of coronavirus (COVID-19) identified in the UK in mid-November 2020 has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative) in our main variant analysis.\nOther variants - including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) - are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group is labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\".\nSince the end of May, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in England and in recent weeks all four UK countries. Because of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included charts in this bulletin or updated the reference tables to show the breakdown by variant. We last published our main variant analysis in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where more details can be found. We will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the technical dataset that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the accompanying technical dataset using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 18 July 2021, the majority (99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nWe also provide information on viruses where we have found a particular genetic change (mutation) called E484K. This mutation is always seen in Beta (B.1.351).\nLaboratory data suggest that this mutation might make it easier for a virus to infect someone again, or to infect someone who has been vaccinated, but the importance of this mutation in terms of its effect in transmitting the virus is still uncertain.\nThis analysis was produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our methods article and our recent blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England  Dataset | Released 30 July 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland  Dataset | Released 30 July 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland  Dataset | Released 30 July 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales  Dataset | Released 30 July 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data  Dataset | Released 30 July 2021  Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\nFigure 1 shows previously published official estimates and modelled trends. The official estimates produced each week are based on the most recent data available at the time of publication. Sometimes test results arrive after this period, and so our modelled estimates are updated regularly to incorporate these late results. Therefore, the modelled estimates provide the best indication of recent trends over time.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 6 August 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was observed in Yorkshire and The Humber and the North East.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 6 August 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the North East, North West, West Midlands and London. For Yorkshire and The Humber, the percentage testing positive increased in the two weeks ending 6 August 2021, however, the trend is uncertain in the week ending 6 August 2021. For the South East, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the most recent two weeks ending 6 August 2021, however, the trend is uncertain in the latest week. The trend is uncertain for all other regions in the week ending 6 August 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n.XLSX\nWhen the percentage of people testing positive is low, sub-regional estimates are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the credible intervals.\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 31 July to 6 August 2021 for sub-regions in England and from 1 to 7 August 2021 for sub-regions in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales is not included as it has the lowest number of infections compared with other UK countries, which results in greater uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates.\n.XLSX\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11 to 12-year-olds and 16 to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the most recent week ending 6 August 2021, the percentage of people testing positive has increased for those in school Year 12 to those aged 24 years, and the trend is uncertain for all other age groups. In the two weeks up to 6 August 2021, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased for those aged 25 to 34 years, 35 to 49 years, and 70 years and above. \u00a0\n.XLSX\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following section and datasets that accompany this bulletin.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0accompanying dataset\u00a0and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: England from 26 June to 6 August 2021 and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 27 June to 7 August 2021. These estimates use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset. \n\n\n\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\nFigure 5 shows the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age from 26 June to 6 August 2021 for England and from 27 June to 7 August 2021 for Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Because of lower positivity rates during some of this period, caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n.XLSX\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our accompanying datasets.\nIn the week ending 24 July 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases continued to decrease in England and Scotland and increased in Northern Ireland. The trend for Wales was uncertain in the week ending 24 July 2021. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days prior to the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. This is particularly the case with the most recent estimates, so it is important to be cautious when using them. When incidence is low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances we recommend focusing on the upper credible interval, which gives an upper bound to the incidence of new infections. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nSince the end of May, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in England and in recent weeks in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show 99% of all COVID-19 infections (in the four weeks to 25 July) where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta Variant. Because of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where more details can be found.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for\u00a0Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest.\nVariants of concern are:\nAlpha: Variant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK. Beta: Variant B.1.351, first identified in South Africa. Gamma: Variant P.1, first identified in Brazil Delta: Variant B.1.617.2, first identified in India.\nVariants of interest are:\nEta: Variant B.1.525, first identified in multiple countries. Iota: Variant B.1.526, first identified in Unites States of America. Kappa: B.1.617.1, first identified in India. Lambda: C.37, first identified in Peru.\nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of coronavirus (COVID-19), identified in the UK in mid-November 2020, has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative) in our main variant analysis.\nOther variants - including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) - are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group is labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\".\nThe Ct value is the number of cycles that each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test goes through before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0technical dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the\u00a0accompanying technical dataset\u00a0using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 25 July 2021, the majority (99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nThis analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0methods article\u00a0and our recent\u00a0blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 13 August 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 13 August 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 13 August 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 13 August 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 13 August 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the\u00a0accompanying technical dataset\u00a0using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 8 August 2021, the vast majority (over 99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nThis analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2014 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0methods article\u00a0and our recent\u00a0blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England   Dataset | Released 20 August 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 20 August 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 20 August 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 20 August 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 20 August 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

In institutional settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases in the community, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other institutional settings\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 20 August 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) increased in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 20 August 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was seen in Yorkshire and The Humber.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals.\n\n\n\nIn the week ending 20 August 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the South East and the West Midlands. In the same week, there are early signs of the percentage of people testing positive levelling off in the North West, following an increase in recent weeks. Also in the same week, there are early signs of the percentage of people testing positive levelling off in Yorkshire and The Humber, following a decrease in recent weeks. The trend is uncertain in the remaining regions in the week ending 20 August 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nWhen the percentage of people testing positive is low, sub-regional estimates are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the credible intervals.\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower, relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them.\n\n\n\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 14 to 20 August 2021 for sub-regions in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying England dataset.\n\n\n\nIn the week ending 20 August 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those in school Year 12 to aged 24 years, and those aged 50 to 69 years. In the same week there are also early signs of an increase in those aged 70 years and over. The percentage of people testing positive decreased in those aged 2 years to school Year 6, and those aged 25 to 34 years, in the week ending 20 August 2021. In the same week, the trend is uncertain for those in school Year 7 to school Year 11 and those aged 35 to 49 years.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following section and Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 10 July to 20 August 2021. These estimates, which are presented in Figure 5, use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Because of lower positivity rates during some of this period, caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\n\n\n\nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 6 August 2021, the number of new PCR-positive coronavirus (COVID-19) cases increased in Wales and there were possible early signs of an increase in the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in England. In the same week, the trend in the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases was uncertain in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days prior to the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. This is particularly the case with the most recent estimates, so it is important to be cautious when using them. When incidence is low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances we recommend focusing on the upper credible interval, which gives an upper bound to the incidence of new infections. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nNew data on the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases will not be in the next publication on 3 September 2021 because of the August bank holiday. New data will next be presented in the publication on 10 September 2021.\nSince the end of May 2021, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in England and in recent weeks in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections (in the four weeks to 8 August 2021) where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant. Because of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where more details can be found.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest.\nVariants of concern are:\nAlpha: Variant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK. Beta: Variant B.1.351, first identified in South Africa.  Gamma: Variant P.1, first identified in Brazil.  Delta: Variant B.1.617.2, first identified in India. \nVariants of interest are:\nEta: Variant B.1.525, first identified in multiple countries.  Iota: Variant B.1.526, first identified in United States of America.  Kappa: B.1.617.1, first identified in India.  Lambda: C.37, first identified in Peru. \nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19, identified in the UK in mid-November 2020, has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative), and cases with that gene pattern were labelled \"compatible with the Alpha variant\" in our previously published variant analysis. Other variants \u2014 including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) \u2014 are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group was labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\" in our previously published variant analysis.\nThe Cycle threshold (Ct) value is the number of cycles that each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test goes through before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 8 August 2021, the vast majority (over 99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nThe sequencing is produced by Public Health England and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. \nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2014 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and our blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England  Dataset | Released 27 August 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland  Dataset | Released 27 August 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.

This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals.\n\n\n\nIn the week ending 27 August 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the South West and the West Midlands. The percentage of people testing positive increased in the North East and the South East over the two weeks up to 27 August 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. The percentage testing positive decreased in London and the East Midlands in the week ending 27 August 2021. The trend was uncertain in the remaining regions in the week ending 27 August 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nWhen the percentage of people testing positive is low, sub-regional estimates are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the credible intervals.\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower, relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them.\n\n\n\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 21 to 27 August 2021 for sub-regions in England and from 22 to 28 August 2021 for sub-regions in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that those aged from 11 to 12 years and those aged from 16 to 17 years have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying England dataset.\n\n\n\nIn the week ending 27 August 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged 70 years and over, although rates remain lowest in this age group; and there were early signs of an increase for those aged 25 to 34 years. The percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged 50 to 69 in the two weeks up to 27 August 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. There were early signs of a decrease in the percentage testing positive for those in School Year 12 to age 24 years in the week ending 27 August 2021. In the same week, the trend was uncertain for all other age groups.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following section and Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: for England this is presented from 17 July to 27 August 2021, and from 18 July to 28 August 2021 for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. These estimates, which are presented in Figure 5, use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 shows a similar picture for England as in Figure 4, with rates decreasing in children and young adults and increasing in the older ages. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison to England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider confidence intervals. The percentage of people testing positive has increased across most ages in Wales and across all ages in Scotland in recent weeks. In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage testing positive was uncertain for nursery and primary school aged children and there are signs of decreases among secondary school aged children, young adults and older ages.\nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days prior to the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. This is particularly the case with the most recent estimates, so it is important to be cautious when using them. When incidence is low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances, we recommend focusing on the upper credible interval, which gives an upper bound to the incidence of new infections. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nNew data on the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases are not included in this publication because of the August bank holiday. Incidence analysis published previously can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets, and new data will be presented in the next publication on 10 September 2021.\nSince the end of May 2021, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in England and in recent weeks in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections (in the four weeks to 8 August 2021) where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant. Because of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where more details can be found.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest.\nVariants of concern are:\nAlpha: Variant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK.  Beta: Variant B.1.351, first identified in South Africa.  Gamma: Variant P.1, first identified in Brazil.  Delta: Variant B.1.617.2, first identified in India. \nVariants of interest are:\nEta: Variant B.1.525, first identified in multiple countries.  Iota: Variant B.1.526, first identified in United States of America.  Kappa: B.1.617.1, first identified in India.  Lambda: C.37, first identified in Peru.  Mu: B.1.621, first identified in Colombia. \nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19, identified in the UK in mid-November 2020, has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative), and cases with that gene pattern were labelled \"compatible with the Alpha variant\" in our previously published variant analysis. Other variants \u2014 including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) \u2014 are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group was labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\" in our previously published variant analysis.\nThe Cycle threshold (Ct) value is the number of cycles that each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test goes through before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 8 August 2021, the vast majority (over 99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nThe sequencing is produced by Public Health England and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2014 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and our blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England  Dataset | Released 3 September 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland  Dataset | Released 3 September 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.

The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey began to cover Scotland in September 2020.\nInfections decreased in Northern Ireland in the week ending 28 August 2021. In Wales, infections increased in the fortnight up to 28 August, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week.\nThe estimated percentage of the community population (those not in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings) that had COVID-19 in the latest week was:\n - 1.41% in England (1 in 70 people), compared with 1.39% in (1 in 70 people) the week before\n - 0.92% in Wales (1 in 110 people), compared with 0.83% (1 in 120 people) the week before\n - 1.56% in Northern Ireland (1 in 65 people), down from 2.36% (1 in 40 people) the week before\n - 1.32% in Scotland (1 in 75 people), up from with 0.70% (1 in 140 people) the week before\nIn England, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged 70 years and over, although rates remained lowest in this age group.

Support is available round the clock, every single day of the year, providing a safe place for anyone struggling to cope, whoever they are, however they feel, whatever life has done to them.\n\n!\n\nDeath registrations for all parts of the UK were unavailable at the time of analysis \u2013 annual UK figures will be updated at a later stage. This release does not show the number of suicides that occurred during the 2020 pandemic because of registration delays. For more information see Deaths from suicide that occurred in England and Wales between April and July 2020.\n\n\n\n\n!\n\nStatistics on suicide are based on the year of death registration \u2013 because of registration delays, around half of these deaths will have occurred in the previous year. \n\n\n\n5,224 suicides were registered in 2020 in England and Wales, 8.2% lower than in 2019 (5,691 deaths), and equivalent to an age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) of 10.0 deaths per 100,000 people. While this was statistically significantly lower than the 2019 ASMR (11.0 deaths per 100,000 people), caution is required in the interpretation of this decrease. \nThe latest decrease is likely to be because of both registration delays during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (see Section 6), and a decrease in male suicide at the start of the pandemic. \nMales continued to account for three-quarters of suicide deaths registered in 2020 (3,925 registered male deaths compared with 1,299 female deaths), as seen since the mid-1990s. In 2020, the suicide ASMR for males in England and Wales was 15.4 deaths per 100,000 \u2013 a statistically significant decrease since 2019 (16.9 deaths per 100,000) but consistent with rates between 2014 and 2018.\nFor females, there were 4.9 deaths per 100,000 registered in England and Wales in 2020. This is consistent with rates seen for more than a decade.\nFor suicides registered in 2020, the age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) in England was 10.0 deaths per 100,000 population (4,912 registered deaths), statistically significantly lower compared with the ASMR in 2019 (10.8 deaths per 100,000). \nIn Wales, there were 10.3 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020 (285 registered deaths). While lower than the ASMR in 2019 (12.2 deaths per 100,000), the difference was not statistically significant because the relatively smaller number of deaths resulted in more statistical uncertainty. The lower rate in Wales during 2020 may be partly explained by longer death registration delays than previous years (see Section 6).\nBy English region, the highest ASMR was in the North East (13.3 deaths per 100,000 people), as has been the case in five out of the last 10 preceding years. The North East, Yorkshire and The Humber and the South West regions had statistically significantly higher ASMRs of suicide compared with the overall England ASMR (10.0 per 100,000). The lowest rate in 2020 was in London (7.0 deaths per 100,000 people), which was statistically lower than any English region. While 2020 had the lowest London rate since records started in 1981, the rate was statistically similar to the London rate in previous years.\nIn 2020, ASMRs in both Yorkshire and The Humber (11.5 per 100,000 people) and the East of England (9.5 per 100,000 people) decreased significantly compared with 2019 (13.8 and 11.6 per 100,000 respectively). These were the only significant changes in English regions, when comparing 2020 with 2019.\nASMRs for males and females tend to follow broadly similar patterns to that of all persons, with further detail in the accompanying datasets. \nIn 2020, males and females aged 45 to 49 years had the highest age-specific suicide rate at 24.1 per 100,000 male deaths (457 registered deaths) and 7.1 per 100,000 female deaths (138 deaths). Figure 3 shows age-specific suicide rates, for 5 year age groups, for all persons since 1981. \nLooking at trends over time in broad age groups, males aged 10 to 24 years have always had the lowest rates. In 2020, the rate in this group was 7.0 deaths per 100,000.\nSince 2010, men aged 45 to 64 years have had the highest age-specific suicide rates. In 2020, the rate in this group was 20.0 deaths per 100,000. Males aged 25 to 44 years had the highest suicide rates between 1995 and 2009, whereas males aged 75 years and above had the highest rates at the beginning of our series between 1981 and 1991.\nRates for all age groups were lower in 2020 than 2019, however, those aged 25 to 44 years were the only males to see a statistically significant decrease (from 20.4 to 18.0 deaths per 100,000, when comparing 2019 and 2020, respectively).\nIn 2020, females aged 10 to 24 years had the lowest age-specific suicide (2.5 death per 100,000 females), while those aged 45 to 64 years had the highest (6.4 deaths per 100,000 females).\nThe most noticeable change over time for females is the substantial fall in rates among those aged 45 years and over. From 1981 to 2020, the female rate fell by:\n55.6% for those aged 45 to 64 years\n79.4% for those aged 65 to 74 years\n72.0% for those aged 75 years and over\nThe most common method of suicide in England and Wales for both males and females continued to be hanging, strangulation and suffocation (all grouped together). This method accounted for 58.1% of all suicides in 2020 (3,036 out of 5,224 registered deaths). The second most common method continued to be poisoning and accounted for 19.9% of all suicides in 2020 (1,041 out of 5,224 deaths).\nLast year\u2019s bulletin on 2019 registrations provides a more detailed description of male and female trends in suicide methods over time. This year, we looked at how suicide method varies by age group, for deaths registered between 2018 and 2020 (Figure 6). \nFor the period 2018 to 2020, hanging accounted for 77.8% of suicides for people aged 10 to 14 years. The proportion of suicides caused by hanging falls steadily as age increases, with this method accounting for 29.1% of suicides in people aged 90 years and over. Conversely, poisoning accounted for 5.6% of suicides for people aged 10 to 14 years and the proportion increases with age to a peak of 29.7% for people aged 90 years and over. \nFor three methods of suicide \u2014 poisoning, sharp object, and other methods \u2014 the highest proportions were seen in people aged 90 years and over.\nIn England and Wales, all deaths by suicide are certified by a coroner following an inquest and cannot be registered until the inquest is completed. This results in a delay between the date a death occurred and the date of registration. Around half of the deaths reported in this bulletin will have occurred in the previous year.\nFor suicides, the median registration delay for England was 165 days in 2020 (down from 166 days in 2019) and 214 days for Wales (up from 165 days in 2019). The median registration delay in Wales increased to its highest level since 2001 and was likely explained by disruption to inquests caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While the median delay in England did not increase in 2020, provisional figures for the first two quarters of 2021 (January to June) show an increase; as such it is possible some suicides that ordinarily would have been registered in 2020, have been registered in 2021 due to the disruption caused by the pandemic.\n\nSuicides in England and Wales  Dataset | Released 7 September 2021  Number of suicides and suicide rates, by sex and age, in England and Wales, registered from 1981 to 2020.

In Wales and Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive increased and the trend was uncertain in Northern Ireland in the week ending 3 September 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 3 September 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was seen in the North East and Yorkshire and The Humber.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 3 September 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the North East and decreased in the North West. The percentage of people testing positive increased in the West Midlands and the South West over the two weeks up to 3 September 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. The percentage of people testing positive was level in London and the South East and the trend was uncertain in the remaining regions in the week ending 3 September 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nWhen the percentage of people testing positive is low, sub-regional estimates are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the credible intervals. \n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower, relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 28 August 2021 to 3 September 2021 for sub-regions in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11 to 12-year-olds and 16 to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0accompanying England dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 3 September 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged two years to school Year 11 and those aged 35 to 49 years. The percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged 70 years and over in the two weeks up to 3 September 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. The percentage of people testing positive decreased for those aged 25 to 34 years and those aged 50 to 69 years, and the trend was uncertain in those in school Year 12 to those aged 24 years in the week ending 3 September 2021.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following section and\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 24 July 2021 to 3 September 2021. These estimates, which are presented in Figure 5, use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England shows rates increasing in children and in older age groups. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison to England due to comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider confidence intervals. The percentage of people testing positive has increased across all ages in Wales and Scotland in recent weeks. In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage testing positive was uncertain for all ages.\nFurther\u00a0analysis on age for Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 20 August 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases increased in Wales and Scotland. In the same week, the trend in the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases was uncertain in Northern Ireland and level in England. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days prior to the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. This is particularly the case with the most recent estimates, so it is important to be cautious when using them. When incidence is low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances we recommend focusing on the upper credible interval, which gives an upper bound to the incidence of new infections. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nSince the end of May 2021, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in England and in recent weeks in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show that over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections (in the four weeks to 8 August 2021) where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant. Because of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where more details can be found.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for\u00a0Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest.\nVariants of concern are:\nAlpha: Variant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK. Beta: Variant B.1.351, first identified in South Africa. Gamma: Variant P.1, first identified in Brazil. Delta: Variant B.1.617.2, first identified in India.\nVariants of interest are:\nEta: Variant B.1.525, first identified in multiple countries. Iota: Variant B.1.526, first identified in United States of America. Kappa: B.1.617.1, first identified in India. Lambda: C.37, first identified in Peru. Mu: B.1.621, first identified in Colombia.\nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19, identified in the UK in mid-November 2020, has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative), and cases with that gene pattern were labelled \"compatible with the Alpha variant\" in our previously published variant analysis. Other variants - including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) - are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group was labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\" in our previously published variant analysis.\nThe Cycle threshold (Ct) value is the number of cycles that each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test goes through before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 8 August 2021, the vast majority (over 99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nThe sequencing is produced by Public Health England and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research & Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) and Genome Research Limited, operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\u00a0\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low --- under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 10 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 10 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 10 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 10 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 10 September 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

Delta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India. \nEta: B.1.525; B.1.1.318  Theta^: P.3, B.1.617.3, AV.1, C.36.3, C.37  Lambda: C.37  Mu: B.1.621 \nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19, identified in the UK in mid-November 2020, has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative), and cases with that gene pattern were labelled \"compatible with the Alpha variant\" in our previously published variant analysis. Other variants \u2013 including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) \u2013 are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group was labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\" in our previously published variant analysis.\nThe Cycle threshold (Ct) value is the number of cycles that each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test goes through before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 6 September 2021, the vast majority (over 99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nThe sequencing is produced by Public Health England and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research & Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) and Genome Research Limited, operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nYou can find more information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey in our Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2014 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and our blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England  Dataset | Released 17 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 17 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 17 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 17 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 17 September 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

Trends were uncertain elsewhere.\n", "id": 69}, {"document": "Age-standardised coronavirus (COVID-19) case rates were highest among the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups during the second wave (1 September 2020 to 22 May 2021), whereas in the first part of the third wave (23 May 2021 to 25 July 2021) the White British ethnic group had the highest case rate.\nCase rates were higher among people born outside of the UK in the second wave, whereas in the third wave case rates were higher among people born in the UK.\nCase rates also differed by religious affiliation, with people identifying as Muslim or Sikh having the highest rates in the second wave, whereas the Christian group had the highest rates in the third wave.\nThroughout the pandemic, COVID-19 case rates were highest among people living in the most deprived areas and in urban areas.\nIn the second wave, case rates were higher in households from lower socio-economic backgrounds than in more affluent ones; in the third wave there was little difference between socio-economic groups other than that those who had never worked or were long-term unemployed had the lowest rates.\nOverall, case rates were lower among disabled people than non-disabled people.\nFurther work is needed to understand better the inequalities in case rates\nLinking NHS Test and Trace data to the ONS Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) dataset, we estimated age-standardised case rates by various socio-demographic characteristics, from 1 September 2020 to 25 July 2021. For more information on the data used in this release see Section 8: Measuring the data. A case is defined as a person who had at least one positive COVID-19 test in a given time period. We primarily focused on socio-demographic characteristics which are not available in traditional health records but can be retrieved from the 2011 Census. We produced weekly rates and rates for the second and third waves of the pandemic (robust NHS Test and Trace data are not available for the first wave). Following definitions outlined in the ONS COVID-19 Insights tool, we classified tests up to and including 22 May 2021 as having occurred in the second wave, with tests from 23 May 2021 to 25 July 2021 (latest data available) classified as the first part of the third wave.\nThe risk of infection is complex and involves a range of interrelated factors. Therefore, it is likely that higher COVID-19 case rates in some groups may be partly explained by co-occurring differences in other characteristics, such as living in an area where infection rates are higher or working in an occupation where the risk of becoming infected is greater. Easing of lockdown restrictions, such as working from home and limits on social contacts, and the vaccine rollout programme may also have played a part in the changing patterns of COVID-19 case rates by socio-demographic characteristics over the course of the pandemic.\nThis bulletin highlights differences in case rates between groups, after accounting for age. We are planning on conducting additional analyses to further understand these differences. \n\n!\n\nThe estimates presented in this release are experimental statistics and should be interpreted with caution. COVID-19 case rates were produced by linking NHS Test and Trace data with the Public Health Data Asset dataset and cover a subset of the population. Therefore, they may differ from the Public Health England COVID-19 case rate administrative data and our infection estimates in the Coronavirus Infection Survey.\n\n\n\nOverall, age-standardised coronavirus (COVID-19) case rates were highest for the Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic groups and lowest for the Chinese ethnic group (Figure 1). The differences between these groups were most pronounced during the second wave (1 September 2020 to 22 May 2021), with rates of 390.6 and 378.1 per 100,000 person-weeks for the Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic groups respectively, compared with 93.0 for the Chinese ethnic group. These figures are consistent with the differences in COVID-19 mortality observed over the second wave of the pandemic, and with results from research carried out by our academic partners at Oxford University based on the Coronavirus Infection Survey. However, the differences in case rates between ethnic groups varied over time.\n\n!\n\nIt was not possible to calculate case rates for the first wave as mass testing was not available. Estimates for the third wave should be considered provisional as it goes beyond 25 July 2021.\n\n\n\nIn the first part of the second wave (September 2020 to early December 2020) case rates were higher in people from South Asian backgrounds, especially among the Pakistani ethnic group. The pattern changed in late December 2020/early January 2021, when the case rate increased sharply in people from the Bangladeshi ethnic group, peaking at 1,876.5 cases per 100,000 person-weeks. It also increased in people from the Black African and Black Caribbean ethnic groups who had higher case rates than those from the White British ethnic group in the second half of the second wave. The case rate remained consistently higher in people from the Pakistani ethnic group than any other ethnic group in the period following the peak (February 2021 to May 2021). During the third wave, case rates were highest in the White British ethnic group, at 234.7 cases per 100,000 person-weeks. Some of these differences may be explained by regional variation in infection rate over time, as some regions, such as London or the West Midlands, are more ethnically diverse than others.\nDuring the second wave of the pandemic, age-standardised COVID-19 case rates per 100,000 person-weeks were highest for people who identified as Muslim (339.3) and Sikh (325.3) (Figure 2). Rates were lowest for people in the \u2018Other Religion\u2019 group (143.5) and the Buddhist population (145.4). However, the differences between religious groups varied over time. During the third wave, those who identified as Christian had the highest rates at 235.1 cases per 100,000 person-weeks, whereas the lowest rates were found in the Buddhist and Hindu groups at 135.8 and 135.9 cases per 100,000 person-weeks, respectively. These differences are broadly consistent with the differences in COVID-19 mortality observed over the second wave, although for most groups they tend to be less pronounced for cases than for deaths; the exception is the Sikh group. \nOverall, during the second wave, case rates were higher for people born outside of the UK than those born in the UK, at 205.2 cases per 100,000 person-weeks compared with 172.6 cases (Figure 3). However, during the first part of the second wave (September 2020 to early December 2020), those born in the UK had higher case rates than those born outside of the UK. Later in the second wave, particularly from December 2020 through to February 2021, rates were higher among those born outside of the UK. During the third wave, rates were higher among those born in the UK (UK born: 225.0, non-UK born: 146.1).\nDuring the second wave, coronavirus (COVID-19) case rates were highest among people living in households where the household reference person was in a semi-routine or routine occupation, at 200.4 and 195.7 cases per 100,000 person-weeks, respectively. In comparison, case rates were lowest among people where the household reference person was in a higher managerial occupation (142.6 cases per 100,000 person-weeks) (Figure 5). During the third wave, however, rates were highest among people where the household reference person was in a lower managerial, administrative or professional occupation (228.5 cases per 100,000 person-weeks) or intermediate occupation (228.1 cases per 100,000 person-weeks). Rates were lowest among people where the household reference person had never worked or were long-term unemployed (178.4 cases per 100,000 person-weeks). During the second and third waves, COVID-19 case rates were highest in the most deprived areas, as measured by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (see reference Table 5). This was consistent with other data sources.\nThroughout the analysis period, urban areas had consistently higher COVID-19 case rates than rural areas. During the second wave, rates were highest in major and minor conurbations at 217.6 and 205.9 cases per 100,000 person-weeks, respectively, whereas rates were lowest in villages, hamlets and isolated dwellings at 119.3 cases (Figure 6). During the third wave, rates were highest in minor conurbations at 273.0 cases per 100,000 person-weeks, while the lowest rates were in villages, hamlets and isolated dwellings, at 177.2 cases. Recent research based on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) data found that Rural Urban Classification was consistently associated with the risk of infection in the second and third wave. In line with Public Health England, we found substantial variation in case rates across regions, especially in the third wave (see reference Table 9). \nOver the whole analysis period and across the second and third waves of the pandemic, coronavirus (COVID-19) case rates were highest among non-disabled people and lowest for disabled people who reported that they were \u201climited a lot\u201d in their day-to-day activities (Figure 7). During the second wave, rates per 100,000 person-weeks for the non-disabled, disabled and \u201climited a little\u201d, and disabled and \u201climited a lot\u201d groups were 175.1, 163.9, and 160.5, respectively. During the third wave, differences between the groups were much larger, with rates being 220.7, 159.5, and 116.2, respectively. Several factors may contribute to these differences. First, as disabled people have a greater risk of death involving COVID-19 than non-disabled people, they may have been more likely to shield and follow social distancing guidance. Secondly, disabled people have been vaccinated more rapidly than non-disabled people, which could explain the lower case rates in the third wave.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) case rates by socio-demographic characteristics, England  Dataset | Released 20 September 2021  Analysis of age-standardised case rates for coronavirus (COVID-19) in England by socio-demographic characteristics. \n\n\n", "summary": "COVID-19 case rates highest in deprived and urban areas\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) case rates in England were highest among people living in the most deprived areas and in urban areas throughout the pandemic.\nAnalysis examined socio-demographic characteristics of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) from 1 September 2020 to 25 July 2021.\nThis period covers the second wave of infections in the UK (1 September 2020 to 22 May 2021) and the start of the third wave (23 May 2021 to 25 July 2021). Testing was not widely available in the first wave of the pandemic to produce any comparable data. Case rates are per 100,000 people, measured by week.\nBy ethnic group, case rates were highest among Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups during the second wave, whereas in the first part of the third wave, the White British group had the highest case rate. This is after accounting for the age structure of different ethnic groups.\nIn the second wave, case rates were higher in households from lower socio-economic backgrounds than in more affluent ones. In the third wave, there was little difference between socio-economic groups other than for people who had never worked or were long-term unemployed, who had the lowest rates.\nOverall, case rates were lower among disabled people than non-disabled people.\n", "id": 72}, {"document": "In England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased in the week ending 18 September 2021; we estimate that 620,100 people within the community population in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 577,100 to 663,900), equating to around 1 in 90 people.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the most recent two weeks, but the trend is uncertain in the week ending 18 September 2021; we estimate that 50,700 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 39,900 to 62,700), equating to around 1 in 60 people.\nIn Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive is uncertain in the week ending 18 September 2021; we estimate that 30,300 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 22,800 to 39,200), equating to around 1 in 60 people.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive appeared level in the week ending 18 September 2021; we estimate that 120,200 people in Scotland had COVID-19, (95% credible interval: 101,000 to 141,500) equating to around 1 in 45 people.\nWithin this bulletin, we summarise some of the latest results from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey.

You can also read our article to find out more about\u00a0comparing methods used in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace\u00a0to better understand comparisons in data sources.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In institutional settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nMore information on COVID-19 and taking part in our survey   For more information, please visit the\u00a0CIS participant guidance\u00a0page.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases in the community, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other institutional settings\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 18 September 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased in England. The trend was uncertain in Northern Ireland and appeared level in Scotland. In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the most recent two weeks, but the trend was uncertain in the week ending 18 September 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall picture for England is a result of the different trends across regions. During the week ending 18 September 2021, the percentage of people testing positive continued to fluctuate across regions. The estimated percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to increase in the North West and decreased in Yorkshire and The Humber, London, and the South East. For all other regions, trends were uncertain. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower, relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 12 September 2021 to 18 September 2021 for sub-regions in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age 2 years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0accompanying England dataset. \n\n\n\nAs with the regional picture, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across age groups. In the week ending 18 September 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged 2 to school Year 6 and those in school Year 7 to school Year 11. In the same week, the trend was uncertain for those aged 50 to 69 years and decreased in all other age groups.\nThe percentage of people testing positive was highest in young people at secondary school. In the week ending 18 September 2021, 2.81% (95% credible interval: 2.35% to 3.33%) of children in school Year 7 to school Year 11 tested positive for COVID-19.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nData by single year of age for England is not available this week. Previous estimates up to 11 September can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 4 September 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases continued to increase in Wales and appeared level in England. In the same week, the trend in the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases was uncertain in Northern Ireland. For Scotland, the incidence rate increased in the two weeks up to 4 September 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the week ending 4 September 2021. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days prior to the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nSince the end of May 2021, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in England and in recent weeks in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections (in the four weeks to 30 August 2021) where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant.\nBecause of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where more details can be found.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for\u00a0Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance (PDF, 2.51MB) :\nUK variants of concern:\u00a0\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nUK variants under investigation (WHO variants of interest):\nLambda: C.37\nMu: B.1.621\nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19, identified in the UK in mid-November 2020, has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative), and cases with that gene pattern were labelled \"compatible with the Alpha variant\" in our previously published variant analysis. Other variants \u2013 including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) \u2013 are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group was labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\" in our previously published variant analysis.\nThe Cycle threshold (Ct) value is the number of cycles that each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test goes through before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 30 August 2021, the vast majority (over 99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nThe sequencing is produced by Public Health England and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) and Genome Research Limited, operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2013 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test''s false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 24 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 24 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 24 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 24 September 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 24 September 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

It screens the different characteristics of people sampled in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) who have and have not tested positive and uses a statistical model to assign risk to each of these characteristics.\nIn this article, analysis is focused on data from 29 August to 11 September 2021. This provides a snapshot of characteristics associated with testing positive for COVID-19 during this time. However, characteristics may not have the same association with testing positive in analyses of previous or future weeks. Therefore, we also present analyses over a longer period from 14 March to 11 September 2021.\nThis article contains the technical details of the methods used and the interpretation of results. This analysis will be updated regularly following this article and the main findings will be available in one of our regular publications.\nThis analysis uses SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) results from nose and throat swabs of participants from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS). \nThe CIS is a large household survey monitoring current COVID-19 infections within the community population in the UK. Community in this instance refers to private residential households and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. Participants were asked about demographics, living environment, behaviours, work, and vaccination uptake. Further information on the study design can be found in COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information. \nThe models included in this analysis were fit at the UK level and cover all ages included in the survey (two years and over). A positive result refers to a participant testing positive at least once over the period of analysis. The period of analysis is 14 days if at least 150 survey participants test positive in this period; otherwise, a 28-day period is used.\nMore detailed information about the methods used for this publication can be found in a recent pre-print paper.\nThis analysis is based on three regression models which identify the characteristics that have the greatest effect on the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19. The three models systematically build up from the first model. This approach enables us to isolate the effects of specific characteristics and behaviours which increase the risk of an individual testing positive. \nWe started with Model 1, the \u201ccore\u201d model, which produces the most accurate representation of the effect of the core demographic characteristics on the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 prior to adding in further characteristics. Model 1 provides a model specification, which allows us to test the effect of each of the main demographic factors, on our full sample, before adding any additional variables. This core model is then used as a base for Model 2, which tests whether other factors that change over time independently affect the likelihood of testing positive. Examples of these factors include characteristics of work or school, or vaccination history. \nModel 2 allows us to identify other predictors of positivity that were not included in the core model, while still controlling for the core demographic characteristics. These core demographic characteristics from Model 1 are included as controls to make sure the analysis adjusts for these factors. For this reason, when looking at the results from Model 2, we do not draw conclusions about the core demographic characteristics from Model 1. \nSimilarly, we use the specification from Model 2 as a base for Model 3, where we look at variables that are sensitive to changes \u2013 these are behavioural variables. This model allows us to identify behaviours that are related to positivity, while controlling for all the core demographic characteristics and the screened characteristics retained from Model 2. Similarly, when looking at the results from Model 3, we do not draw conclusions about the core demographic characteristics from Model 1 or the screened characteristics from Model 2.\nOur first model, Model 1 (the core model), predicts the likelihood of an individual testing positive based on general demographic characteristics in order to help identify broad groups where infections are persisting or arising. This model contains eight core demographic characteristics:\nsex\nethnicity\nage\ngeographical region\nurban or rural classification of their address\ndeprivation percentile\nhousehold size\nwhether the household was multigenerational\nAssociations between the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and these core variables are estimated and included in all model outputs. The model also tests for interactions between the core demographic characteristics, retaining interactions that are significant at a 0.001 threshold.\nWe then built upon Model 1 resulting in Model 2, the screening model. This includes the core demographic characteristics from Model 1 and incorporates other characteristics individually to identify other factors associated with testing positive for COVID-19. It first gives us the impact of each newly included variable on the likelihood of testing positive while controlling for the core characteristics. \nExamples of characteristics screened include work or school status, ability to social distance at work or school, patient-facing healthcare or social-care roles, work sector, travel to work, contact with patients/clients at work, current health status including COVID-19 vaccination, smoking status, travel abroad and whether participants have been in contact with care homes or hospitals. Work or school status is included as an additional control in all models testing other factors associated with work or school. Subsequently we include in Model 2 only those screened characteristics that predict whether someone tests positive for COVID-19, independently of the other characteristics, using a technique called backward elimination with a significance threshold of 0.05. The sample is slightly smaller here as cases with missing responses to the variables used are removed.\nFinally, Model 3 (the behaviours model) adds behaviour variables to the core demographic characteristics from Model 1 and the screened characteristics that were kept in Model 2. Subsequently, this model examines behaviours individually to identify further characteristics associated with testing positive for COVID-19. \nAs with Model 2, it gives us the impact of each included variable on the likelihood of testing positive while controlling for all other variables in the model. Subsequently we include in Model 3 only those characteristics that predict whether someone tests positive for COVID-19, independently of the other characteristics, using backward elimination with a significance threshold of 0.05. A participant\u2019s behaviour(s) may change as a result of testing positive before the survey visit, for example, through a test taken in the national testing programme. To minimise this affecting our results, in this model, we take the maximum of each behaviour reported for the individual in the 35 days prior to the survey visit. To ensure that behaviour(s) prior to the positive test are reported, only participants who have at least one negative test between 10 and 35 days prior to the CIS visit were included in this model. This means that this model uses a smaller sample, including only those participants who have responses in a certain window before their visit while testing negative, so we can impute past behaviour and minimise reverse causality effects.\nTo investigate the effects of characteristic(s) over time we also present 14-day or 28-day results over time for Models 1, 2 and 3 in the accompanying dataset. When looking at the core model (Model 1) over time we use main effect only models, with no interactions included. For Models 2 and 3, each variable is included individually on top of the established core model for each period \u2013 the screening characteristics and behaviours are modelled individually at this stage, in separate models, so that we can see the effect of all variables in each period while controlling for the core variables. \nThis analysis uses data from 29 August to 11 September 2021, with 1,889 participants testing positive out of 167,288 participants from across the UK included in the model.\nFigure 1 presents findings from Model 1 in the fortnight ending 11 September 2021.\nPeople living in a household of three or more occupants were more likely to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) than single occupancy households.\nPeople living in less deprived areas were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than those in more deprived areas.\nResults for other characteristics included in the model can be found in the accompanying dataset. \nFigure 2 presents the predicted probability of testing positive for COVID-19 by age and by countries of the UK and region of England in the fortnight ending 11 September 2021. \nThe effect of age of individuals on the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 varied by countries of the UK and region of England in the fortnight ending 11 September 2021. People in the younger ages were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 across the UK in the fortnight ending 11 September 2021. In particular, those aged between 15 and 25 years were most likely to test positive. However, the amount by which younger people were at higher risk was greater in some areas, particularly Scotland and the South West, and smaller in others, particularly in London and the North West.\nThese are predicted probabilities that give the trend across years of age calculated at a reference value for other factors (male, White ethnicity, household size of one, non-multigenerational household, living in a major urban area, 50th deprivation percentile) and should not be used as population positivity rates. Levels of positivity in the population may be different because of other factors not included. \nOur accompanying dataset presents findings from Model 1 over time from 14 March to 11 September 2021.\nKey findings are:\nPeople living in households with three or more occupants were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than single occupancy households in most of the 14-day or 28-day periods from 14 March to 22 May 2021 and from 18 July to 11 September 2021.\nFemales were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than males in four out of five 14-day periods between 20 June and 28 August 2021.\nPeople living in less deprived areas were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than those in more deprived areas from 14 March to 22 May 2021 and in four out of five periods from 4 July to 11 September 2021.\nAssociations with testing positive for COVID-19 varied by countries of the UK and region of England since 14 March 2021.\nPositivity rates were lower over June and July 2021 so the effects of different characteristics on an individual\u2019s risk of a positive test were less apparent. \nThis analysis uses data from 29 August to 11 September 2021, with 1,883 participants testing positive out of 166,296 participants from across the UK included in the model.\nThe number of participants included is smaller than for Model 1 because of the restriction criteria explained in the \u2018About this analysis\u2019 section in the Overview.\nFigure 3 presents findings from Model 2 in the fortnight ending 11 September 2021.\nPeople who had received one or two doses of a coronavirus vaccine (Astra Zeneca, Pfizer or Moderna) were less likely to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) than those not vaccinated.\nPeople who had had coronavirus (COVID-19) previously (had a positive swab in the survey or the England Test and Trace programme more than 120 days ago) were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than those with no previous COVID-19 infection.\nPeople taking regular lateral flow tests were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than individuals who do not. This has been seen consistently since 14 March 2021. Regular lateral flow tests are recommended for people whose work or other factors put them at high risk of getting COVID-19. Therefore, this association may reflect this underlying risk.\nOther findings presented in Figure 3 may be more likely to be chance findings that are not seen consistently and should be viewed with caution.\nThose who report being impacted a lot by disability were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than non-disabled individuals. This was only found on two other occasions since 14 March 2021.\nPeople who only vape were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than non-smokers. This was only found on one other occasion since 14 March 2021.\nResults for other characteristics included in the model can be found in the accompanying dataset. \nOur accompanying dataset presents findings from Model 2 over time from 14 March to 11 September 2021.\nKey findings are:\nPeople who had received one or two vaccine doses were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 compared with those not vaccinated in almost all periods from 14 March to 11 September 2021.\nPeople who had had COVID-19 previously were less likely to test positive than those with no previous COVID-19 infection from 20 June to 11 September 2021.\nPeople not working were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 compared with those working, from 6 June to 14 August 2021.\nPeople working in healthcare were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 in six out of eight periods between 25 April and 28 August 2021.\nPeople working in hospitality were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 in four out of five periods between 20 June and 28 August 2021.\nThis analysis uses data from 29 August to 11 September 2021, with 1,128 participants testing positive out of 114,700 participants from across the UK included in the model.\nThe number of participants included is smaller than for Models 1 and 2 because of the restriction criteria explained in the \u2018About this analysis\u2019 section in the Overview.\nFigure 4 presents findings from Model 3 in the fortnight ending 11 September 2021.\nPeople who never wore a face covering in enclosed spaces were more likely to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) than those who always wear a face covering in enclosed spaces.\nPeople who reported socially distanced contact with 11 or more people aged 18 to 69 years outside their household were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than those reporting no socially distanced contact with adults aged 18 to 69 years outside their household.\nResults for other characteristics included in the model and results for earlier time periods can be found in the accompanying dataset. \n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of populations in the UK by risk of COVID-19  Dataset | Released 27 September 2021  Analysis of populations in the UK by risk of COVID-19 from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. \n\n\nThis Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford.

More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases in the community, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other institutional settings\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 25 September 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) increased in England and Wales and decreased in Scotland. In the same week, the trend was uncertain in Northern Ireland.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall changing picture for England is a result of the different trends across regions. During the week ending 25 September 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across regions. The percentage of people testing positive increased in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, the East Midlands and the South West; and decreased in the North East and London in the week ending 25 September 2021. For all other regions, trends were uncertain. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 19 to 25 September 2021 for sub-regions in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age 2 years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying England dataset. \n\n\n\nAs with the regional picture, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across age groups. In the week ending 25 September 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged 2 years to school year 11 and there were early signs of a possible increase for those aged 70 years and over. In the same week, the percentage of people testing positive decreased for those in school year 12 to aged 24 years and levelled off for those aged 35 to 69 years. The trend was uncertain for those aged 25 to 34 years in the week ending 25 September 2021.\nThe percentage of people testing positive was highest in young people at secondary school. In the week ending 25 September 2021, 4.58% (95% credible interval: 4.02% to 5.16%) of children in school year 7 to school year 11 tested positive for COVID-19.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in\u00a0our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 15 August to 25 September 2021. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. They relate to a six-week time period and are produced using a different method to the grouped aged analysis presented previously, which relates only to the latest week, and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggest that the percentage testing positive increased in young people in recent weeks. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison to England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider confidence intervals. In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive increased for children and young adults in recent weeks, and the trend was uncertain for older age groups. In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage testing positive was uncertain across all age groups. In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive decreased for children and young adults in recent weeks, but the trend remained uncertain for older age groups.\nFurther\u00a0analysis on age for Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 11 September 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases appeared to remain level in England and decreased in Scotland. In the same week, the trend in the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases was uncertain in Northern Ireland and Wales. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days prior to the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nSince the end of May 2021, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in England, and then later in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections (in the four weeks to 30 August 2021) where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant.\nBecause of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where more details can be found.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for\u00a0Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest. These are variants that the UK government has\u00a0under surveillance (PDF, 2.51MB)\u00a0:\nUK variants of concern:\u00a0\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nUK variants under investigation (WHO variants of interest):\nLambda: C.37\nMu: B.1.621\nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19, identified in the UK in mid-November 2020, has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative), and cases with that gene pattern were labelled \"compatible with the Alpha variant\" in our previously published variant analysis. Other variants \u2013 including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) \u2013 are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group was labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\" in our previously published variant analysis.\nThe Cycle threshold (Ct) value is the number of cycles that each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test goes through before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 30 August 2021, the vast majority (over 99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nThe sequencing is produced by Public Health England (PHE) and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) and Genome Research Limited, operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2013 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 1 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 1 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 1 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 1 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 1 October 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

By August 2021, the scheme had supported 1.3 million businesses and 11.6 million jobs. The scheme came to an end on 30 September 2021.\nUsing data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), this article presents new analysis about all the workers in the UK who had been furloughed at any point between March 2020 and June 2021. The OPN data used is up to August 2021, and is mainly used to look at furlough duration, whether people changed employer, and the skill set of employees. Focusing on all workers ever affected by the scheme makes our analysis different to the CJRS statistics; more information can be found in the Data sources and quality section.\n\n!\n\nPeople who have ever been furloughed are defined as those that have been on furlough at any point since the pandemic started, including currently on furlough as of April to June 2021. They are compared with \"employees during the pandemic, who have never been furloughed\"; this is anyone who has been employed at some point since the pandemic started up to April to June 2021, but has never been on furlough, so excludes those who did not work at all during this time. When comparing groups, all differences stated are statistically significant unless stated otherwise. \n\n\n\nAccording to the LFS, one in four people who have been employees during the pandemic had been on furlough at some point since March 2020. \nThe proportion of people who have ever been furloughed was higher (30%) for workers aged under 24 years and over 65 years, compared with 23% of workers aged 35 to 44 years. Single working parents were particularly affected, as 31% of them were furloughed, compared with 24% of workers living as a couple with dependent children. \nAfter controlling for differences in other individual and job characteristics, we find that Asian workers were 3.8 percentage points less likely to be furloughed when compared with those of White ethnicity. Although more disabled workers were furloughed than non-disabled workers (28% versus 26%), this difference was not significant once personal and job characteristics were accounted for. More individual characteristics differences in likelihoods of having ever been furloughed can be found in the associated datasets. \nThe likelihood of being furloughed was lower for those with qualifications above A level, even after accounting for differences in individual and industry characteristics. Employees during the pandemic with a degree or equivalent qualification were 8.9 percentage points less likely to be furloughed, when compared with those whose highest qualifications were GCSEs. This may reflect more specific job responsibilities or levels of experience across people with similar jobs, which meant certain people were less likely to go on furlough.\nCJRS statistics up to 30 June 2021 show that workers in hospitality, construction and recreation were among the most likely to have been furloughed. LFS data also show that 55% employees who were in arts, entertainment and recreation, and 69% of employees in accommodation and food services in the three months to June 2021 had been furloughed in the past. However, Figure 3 shows that those working in the group of occupations that includes corporate managers and directors, or in professional occupations (that is, \"Highest skill level\") were less likely to have been furloughed in the past regardless of the industry they were in. More detailed furlough rates by occupation can be found in the associated datasets.\nWhen controlling for individual and labour market characteristics, people working in the \u201chighest skill level\u201d were 8 percentage points less likely to have been furloughed than those in the \u201clowest skill level\u201d. \nHalf of people who have ever been furloughed spent more than three months in total on the scheme, across all the periods they may have been on furlough, and 24% spent six months or more furloughed. \nHowever, some groups of people were more likely to be furloughed for longer. Data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) show that, of all those who have ever been furloughed, 54% of women were furloughed for more than three months, compared with 45% of men. In addition, a greater proportion of furloughed disabled workers were furloughed for more than three months when compared with non-disabled workers (51% compared with 42%), although there could be other factors that we do not account for driving this difference.\nOf all those who had ever been furloughed, the large majority were still in work in the three months to June 2021, even if they were still on furlough. According to CJRS statistics, there were still 1.9 million employments on furlough by the end of June 2021, which represented about 16% of all employments on furlough since the beginning of the scheme. See the data sources and quality section for comparisons between the different sources, as well as the Comparison of furloughed jobs data, UK: March 2020 to June 2021 release, which compares CJRS statistics with Business Insights and Conditions Survey furlough estimates. BICS furlough estimates have been released during the pandemic by industry and region. According to the Labour Force Survey, over 9 in 10 (92%) of those who were ever furloughed were still employees, which is comparable with those who had never been furloughed (93%). The difference in employment rates between those furloughed and who had never been furloughed was not statistically significant.\n\n!\n\nThis analysis does not measure whether people who were still on furlough by June 2021 were in work when the furlough scheme ended on 30 September 2021. The ONS will continue to monitor the outcomes of those who were furloughed as more recent data become available. \n\n\n\nCurrent employees who had ever been furloughed were more likely to be in part-time work than those who were never furloughed (30% of furloughed workers compared with 23% of workers who were never furloughed). They were also more than twice as likely to be on a zero-hours contract than those who were never furloughed, at 5% and 2% respectively. \nCurrent employees who had ever been furloughed were also more likely to be looking to change their employment situation. They were more likely to be looking for a different or additional job (7% compared with 5%) and were twice as likely to report that they were looking for this work because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (21% compared with 12%). \nAlthough the majority of people who have been employees during the pandemic were still employees by April to June 2021, regardless of furlough status, 8% of them were out of work. \nOut of these recently out-of-work employees, people who have ever been furloughed were slightly more likely to be looking for a job and available to start, that is, unemployed as opposed to economically inactive (2.8% of people who have ever been furloughed compared with 2.1% of those who had never been furloughed were unemployed). Once differences in personal characteristics, education level and most recent job details were accounted for, people who have been furloughed were just over 1 percentage point more likely to be out of work (either inactive or unemployed). \nWe find that 4% of disabled furloughed people had slipped into unemployment compared with 3% of non-disabled furloughed people. In addition, 8% of disabled people who were furloughed were economically inactive (that is, not looking or available to start work) compared with 4% of non-disabled furloughed people. This might be caused by differences in their personal characteristics. \nMost furloughed employees stayed with the same employer that they had initially been furloughed from. Labour Force Survey (LFS) data show that in the three months to June 2021, 86% of workers who were furloughed in April to June 2020 were still with the same employer they were furloughed from 12 months later. A higher proportion (94%) of employees who had never been furloughed remained with the same employer in the same period. \nOpinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) data show that for those who have changed employer since being furloughed, there is no statistically significant difference between whether they found a job in the same sector (47%) or a new sector (53%). The difference between these two outcomes was not statistically significant.\nWorkers aged between 16 and 24 years were less likely to stay with the same employer (64%) when compared with all other age groups (25 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years and 65 to 75 years), which ranged from 79% to 91%. This continues a pattern seen before the pandemic, where young people tended to move jobs in the labour market more often than other age groups.\nLonger periods of furlough were associated with a lower likelihood of being employed. OPN data show that 94% of those who were furloughed for up to three months reported being employed by July to August 2021 compared with 89% of those on furlough for more than three months. This follows previous analysis that shows the length of time out of work can affect your chances of returning to work.\nPeople who have ever been furloughed have had a temporary period away from their job, where they have not been carrying out the roles and responsibilities their job normally demands. Previous research such as Edin and Gustavsson (2008) has suggested that prolonged absences from work may lead to workers losing some of their workplace skills. This can be detrimental as workplace skills can impact future earnings, and subsequent job satisfaction and promotion and training opportunities (see Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2019) (PDF, 2.42MB)).\nWe used data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) to understand how the skills of the people who have ever been furloughed compared with people who worked during the pandemic but werenot furloughed.\u00a0 More information about the way the OPN skills data were collected and analysed can be found in the Data sources and quality section.\nDespite not actively using their work skills, the skill set of the furloughed population was more like the skill set of employees, rather than the unemployed. The furloughed population reported being good at a similar number of skills, and good at the same types of skills as employed people who had never been furloughed. They also reported similar skills they would like to improve upon.\nHowever, there were some subtle differences between people who have ever been furloughed and employees during the pandemic who have never been furloughed.\nWe asked people to report their ability against a list of 10 different skills, such as advanced maths, manual work, and presentation skills. People who have ever been furloughed identified a slightly greater number of skills they would like to improve for their career when compared with employees during the pandemic who have never been furloughed (1.8 versus 1.6).\nUnderstanding the skills that the people who have ever been furloughed would like to improve for their career can help identify training needs for them and can also give some indication of whether they are looking to change jobs.\u00a0 Figure 8 highlights some of the skills that people who have ever been furloughed were more likely to want to improve than employees during the pandemic, who have never been furloughed.\n\n\nFigure 8: People who have been furloughed were more likely to want to improve their skills in using technical equipment, basic IT and manual work than employees never furloughed\nProportion of selected skills people would like to improve on, by furlough and employment status, Great Britain, 14 July to 22 August 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Office for National Statistic \u2013 Opinions and Lifestyle Survey\n\nNotes:\n\n\"Using technical equipment\" includes things such as operating machinery.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 8: People who have been furloughed were more likely to want to improve their skills in using technical equipment, basic IT and manual work than employees never furloughed\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nAfter accounting for differences in personal characteristics, education levels and occupations, those who had been furloughed mentioned slightly more skills that they would like to improve on average, at 0.1. Whether someone was furloughed or not was far less important than other characteristics such as age. On average, those aged 16 to 24 years mentioned 0.9 more skills they would like to improve on than those aged between 45 and 54 years, after controlling for other characteristics.\n\n!\n\nWe do not know about the skills of the furloughed and the non-furloughed populations before the furlough scheme started, so we cannot say that being furloughed has caused some of these differences, as they may have already existed before the scheme began. We can say that there are small but significant differences between those who have and have not been furloughed, even after we control for differences in occupations and other characteristics. \n\n\n\nThe top three skills the people who have ever been furloughed wanted to improve for their career were:\nadvanced IT (36%)\ncreative skills (29%)\nadvanced maths (21%)\nThese three skills are amongst the skills that they used the least in their current or most recent job.\nThere are different reasons why furloughed workers may want to improve on skills for their career they did not use in the workplace. For example, a lower perceived skill level by a worker could lead to that skill being used less in the workplace. Alternatively, this could suggest that those who had been furloughed are looking to expand their current skillset to move jobs, whether that be a promotion or a different career.\u00a0\nThe top three skills people who have ever been furloughed thought they were good at were the same as employees during the pandemic who have never furloughed, as shown by Figure 9. This was true regardless of the occupation people were in, and whether this occupation had high rates of furlough.\nThose who have ever been furloughed reported being good at slightly fewer skills compared with employees who have never been furloughed. Among furloughed workers, 56% chose four or more skills they thought they were good at, compared with 60% of those currently employed who have never been furloughed. The figure for the unemployed who had never been furloughed was lower at 46%.\nAfter accounting for differences in personal characteristics, education levels and occupations, people who have ever been furloughed mentioned 0.1 fewer skills that they thought they were good at on average when compared with employees during the pandemic who have never been furloughed. This is not as big as other effects we observe, such as those with a degree-level highest qualification reporting 0.3 more skills they thought they were good at on average than those whose highest qualification was GCSEs graded A* to C. However, it does suggest that people who have ever been furloughed think they are good at slightly less skills than employees during the pandemic who have never been furloughed. \n\nSkill set of people who have been furloughed in Great Britain Dataset | Released 1 October 2021 Skill set of people who have been furloughed: the types of skills furloughed workers think they are good at, would like to improve for their career and use in their current job.Labour market flows for people who have been furloughed in the UK Dataset | Released 1 October 2021 Labour market flows of people who have been furloughed.Characteristics of people who have been furloughed in the UK Dataset | Released 1 October 2021 Individual and labour market characteristics of people who have been furloughed. \n\n\nSections on characteristics and flows in this article uses data collected through the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) Labour Force Survey (LFS), using the April to June 2021 data.\nThe LFS is a large representative survey of households in the UK.

After restricting the dataset to those who reported being an employee at the time of data collection, or who had a job at some point since March 2020, the sample size included 9,737 adults aged 16 years and over in Great Britain. Pooling six waves of data together increases sample sizes, allowing us to explore skills levels for different groups of the population.\nEstimates for whether those who have been furloughed and employed remained in the job they were furloughed from, and whether those who have changed jobs changed sectors, uses a two-week pooled dataset, covering 11 August to 15 August and 18 August to 22 August 2021. After restricting the dataset to those who reported being an employee at the time of data collection, or who had a job at some point since March 2020, the sample size was 2,990 adults aged 16 years and over in Great Britain.\nSurvey weights were applied to make estimates representative of the population for both sets of pooled data (based on May 2021 population estimates).\nFurther information on the survey design and quality of the OPN can be found in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey QMI.\nTo measure the skill set of respondents, they were asked the following questions:\n(a) In which of the following do you feel competent?\nPlease select all that apply\nbasic IT, such as sending emails or using the internet\nadvanced IT, such as data science and programming\nbasic maths, such as price sums and percentages\nadvanced maths, such as accountancy or statistics\nmanual work, such as repairs and construction\nusing technical equipment, such as operating machines\ncustomer service or sales\npresenting or negotiating\ncreative skills, such as performance, web design or product design\nother, please specify\n(b) Thinking about your current or most recent job, which of the following do you do?\nSame answer options as above\n(c ) Which, if any, of these skills would you like to improve on for your career if you were offered the training?\nSame answer options as above\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) statistics use data from HM Revenue and Customs' claims data to measure the number of employments supported by the CJRS scheme.\u00a0This means that if a person is furloughed from two jobs, this person would be counted twice in the CJRS statistics.\nThis is different to the analysis in this article. This article uses survey data from people who self-reported being furloughed, regardless of the number of jobs they may have been furloughed from. If a person was furloughed from two jobs, this would count only once in our analysis.\nDespite the differences in concepts, there are similar distributional findings such as the differences in furlough rates for industries and age groups. However, CJRS statistics show higher levels of employments on furlough than number of people on furlough from the LFS, for April to June 2021. \n", "summary": "One in four employees furloughed during the pandemic\nOne in four people (26%) who were employees during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic were furloughed at some point between March 2020 and June 2021.\nHalf of those were furloughed for more than three months and were less likely to be in employment by August 2021\u202f(89% compared with 94% of those furloughed for less than three months).\nOf all those ever furloughed, more than one in five (22%) had switched employer and more than one in 10 (12%) moved to a new sector.\nEmployees with GCSEs as their highest qualification\u202fwere more likely to have been furloughed than employees with a degree or equivalent qualification, even after accounting for differences in individual characteristics, or their occupation or industry.\nCurrent employees who had been furloughed were more likely to be on a zero-hours contract than those who were never furloughed (5% and 2% respectively).\nCurrent employees who had ever been furloughed were also more likely to be looking to change their employment situation. They were more likely to be looking for a different or additional job (7% compared with 5%) and were twice as likely to report that they were looking for this work because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (21% compared with 12%).\n", "id": 83}, {"document": "Around 1 in 6 (17%) adults experienced some form of depression in summer 2021 (21 July to 15 August); this is a decrease since early 2021 (21% during 27 January to 7 March) but is still above levels before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (10%).\nRates of depressive symptoms peaked earlier in 2021 before falling to 17% at the end of March (31 March to 4 April); since then, levels have been largely stable.\nOver the period 21 July to 15 August 2021:\nYounger adults and women were more likely to experience some form of depression, with around 1 in 3 (32%) women aged 16 to 29 years experiencing moderate to severe depressive symptoms, compared with 20% of men of the same age.\nDisabled (36%) and clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) adults (28%) were more likely to experience some form of depression than non-disabled (8%) and non-CEV adults (16%).\nAround 3 in 10 (29%) adults who reported being unable to afford an unexpected expense of \u00a3850 experienced some form of depression, compared with around 1 in 10 (11%) adults who were able to afford this expense.\nUnemployed adults (31%) were twice as likely to experience some form of depression than those who were employed or self-employed (15%).\nAround 1 in 4 (24%) adults living in the most deprived areas of England experienced some form of depression; this compared with around 1 in 8 (12%) adults in the least deprived areas of England.\nOf adults experiencing some form of depression, almost three-quarters (74%) reported that the coronavirus pandemic was affecting their well-being; this compared with around one in three (32%) adults with no or mild depressive symptoms.\nAround one in six (17%) adults aged 16 years and over in Great Britain experienced some form of depression in summer 2021 (21 July to 15 August 2021). This is fewer than in early 2021 (27 January to 7 March 2021) (21%) and November 2020 (11 to 29 November 2020) (19%). However, rates in summer 2021 remained higher than those observed before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (July 2019 to March 2020), where 10% of adults experienced some form of depression (Figure 1).\nThe presence of some form of depression was indicated by a score of 10 or more on the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8), which is also referred to as moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Further information can be found in the Glossary. Previous estimates of adults experiencing some form of depression using the same measure were published in August 2020, December 2020 and May 2021.\nPercentage of adults with moderate to severe depressive symptoms, Great Britain, July 2019 to August 2021 \nIt is important to note that reasons for changes in the prevalence of depressive symptoms over time are likely to be complex. Reasons may include the impact of changes to restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic and seasonal variation in levels of depressive symptoms, as well as other factors. As such, we cannot determine the cause of these changes from the analysis presented in this article.\nFor the first time we have looked at weekly rates of adults experiencing some form of depression (indicated by moderate to severe depressive symptoms), covering the period 27 January to 22 August 2021. \nRates of moderate to severe depressive symptoms were highest earlier in the year before falling to 17% at the end of March (31 March to 4 April 2021). Since then, levels have been largely stable (Figure 2).\nPercentage of adults with moderate to severe depressive symptoms, Great Britain, February to August 2021 \nWeekly estimates of depressive symptoms by characteristics, including age, sex and region, can be found in the accompanying data tables.\nRates of some form of depression (indicated by moderate to severe depressive symptoms) in summer 2021 were lower across most population groups when compared to early 2021, although they remained higher than pre-pandemic levels (Figure 3). \nFor adults aged 16 to 39 years, rates in summer 2021 were lower (23%) than early 2021 (29%) but were still more than double when compared with before the pandemic (11%). In comparison, the proportion of adults aged 70 years and over experiencing some form of depression remained stable between summer 2021 (9%) and early 2021 (10%), having increased from 5% before the pandemic. \nIn summer 2021, over one in four (29%) adults who reported being unable to afford an unexpected but necessary expense of \u00a3850 experienced some form of depression, having fallen from over one in three (35%) in early 2021. For adults who were able to afford this expense, 11% experienced moderate to severe depressive symptoms in summer 2021, decreasing from 13% in early 2021. \nPercentage of adults with moderate to severe depressive symptoms, Great Britain, July 2019 to August 2021\nFurther information is available in the accompanying data tables. \nThis section explores the rates of some form of depression (indicated by moderate to severe depressive symptoms, a score of 10 or more on the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire) in summer 2021 (21 July to 15 August 2021) by detailed characteristics. \n\n!\n\nIt is important to note that associations between characteristics and the presence of some form of depression may not reflect a causal relationship. \n\n\n\nIn summer 2021, adults aged 16 to 29 years were most likely to experience some form of depression (26%), while adults aged 70 years and over were least likely to experience some form of depression (9%) when compared with any other age group (Figure 4). This pattern has remained unchanged from early 2021. \nWomen were more likely than men to experience some form of depression across all age groups, except for those aged 70 years and over where there was no significant difference. \nAround one in three (32%) women aged 16 to 29 years experienced some form of depression in summer 2021 compared with 20% of men of the same age (Figure 5). \nAround one in three (36%) disabled adults experienced some form of depression in summer 2021; this was over four times greater than non-disabled adults (8%). Adults who identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) were more likely to experience some form of depression (28%) than non-CEV adults (16%) (Figure 6).\nFor definitions of disability and CEV status, see the Glossary. \nTwice as many unemployed adults (31%) experienced some form of depression compared with employed or self-employed adults (15%). Adults who were retired (8%) were the least likely to experience some form of depression across all employment groups, while those who were economically inactive for reasons other than retirement (36%) had similar rates of moderate to severe depressive symptoms to those who were unemployed (31%) (Figure 7). \nAround 3 in 10 (29%) adults who reported being unable to afford an unexpected but necessary expense of \u00a3850 experienced some form of depression, compared with 11% of adults who reported being able to afford this expense.\nIn addition, for working age adults aged 16 to 64 years, rates of moderate to severe depressive symptoms generally decreased as income increased. Around 3 in 10 (29%) working adults with a personal income of less than \u00a310,000 a year experienced some form of depression; this was four times greater than working adults with a personal income of \u00a350,000 or more (7%) (Figure 8).\nIn summer 2021, around one in four (23%) adults residing in single-person households experienced some form of depression, compared with one in six (16%) adults living in multi-person households (Figure 9). \nAdults renting their home were the most likely to experience some form of depression (26%) when compared with all other tenure groups. This compared with 11% of adults who reported owning their home outright (Figure 10).\nAdults living in the most deprived areas of England (based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation) were twice as likely to experience some form of depression in summer 2021 (24%) than adults living in the least deprived areas (12%) (Figure 11).\nFor a definition of area deprivation, see the Glossary.\nRates of moderate to severe depression appeared to vary between the regions of England, Wales and Scotland \u2013 ranging from 15% in Wales and the East of England to 22% in the North East. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Additional analysis by region, including comparisons over time, can be found in accompanying data tables.\nAdults were asked, \u201cIn which way is the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affecting your life?\u201d. In summer 2021 (21 July to 15 August 2021), the impacts most commonly reported by adults experiencing some form of depression (indicated by moderate to severe depressive symptoms, a score of 10 or more on the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were: \nwell-being affected (74%)\nlack of freedom and independence (44%)\naccess to healthcare and treatment for non-coronavirus (COVID-19) related issues being affected (40%)\nThe impact on well-being and lack of freedom and independence remained the most common types of impact reported from early 2021 (27 January to 7 March 2021), although they have both seen decreases (from 85% and 66% respectively). The proportion of adults experiencing some form of depression who reported access to healthcare and treatment for non-coronavirus related issues was affecting their life appeared to increase compared with early 2021 (36%), although this increase was not statistically significant (Figure 12). \nOf adults experiencing some form of depression in summer 2021, almost three-quarters (74%) reported that the coronavirus pandemic was affecting their well-being. This compared with around one in three (32%) adults with no or mild depressive symptoms. \nThe aspects of well-being most commonly reported as being affected by adults experiencing some form of depression were:\nfeeling stressed or anxious (83%)\nfeeling worried about the future (69%)\nmaking my mental health worse (64%)\nfeeling lonely (61%)\nfeeling bored (53%)\nThe aspects of well-being most commonly reported as being affected in summer 2021 were similar to those reported in early 2021 and earlier in the pandemic (June 2020 and November 2020). \nFigure 13 shows the aspects of well-being with the biggest percentage point differences between summer 2021 and early 2021 among adults experiencing some form of depression. Of those who said the coronavirus pandemic was affecting their well-being, 53% experiencing some form of depression reported feeling bored (down from 68% in early 2021). A similar fall was seen in those reporting they were unable to exercise as normal (27% down from 40% in early 2021).\nThe proportion of adults with some form of depression that reported feeling like a burden or that they had no one to talk to about their worries (both 42% in summer 2021) increased over this time period (from 30% and 33% in early 2021, respectively). \nOf those experiencing some form of depression in summer 2021, around 6 in 10 (61%) reported that they felt lonely \u201coften or always\u201d or \u201csome of the time\u201d. This compared with 17% of those with no or mild depressive symptoms. These estimates have remained stable since June 2020.

Reference periods are clearly stated at the start of each section, with more detail on what the analysis covers. \n\n\n\nThis section looks at the rate of coronavirus (COVID-19) reinfections in the UK between 2 July 2020 and 25 September 2021. We first presented results of reinfection analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of reinfections of COVID-19: June 2021, but have updated our methodology for analysis relating to reinfections since that time. Our article gives a more detailed explanation of the methods used.\n\n!\n\nThis analysis is not directly comparable with reinfection analysis published on 29 June 2021. From the 25 August 2021 we updated our definition of reinfection to use a cut-off of 120 days rather than 90 days. Further methodological improvements have been made to our modelling approach as of 6 October 2021. Details are available in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of reinfections of COVID-19: June 2021. \n\n\n\nImprovements to our modelling approach apply to reinfections analysis based on the COVID-19 Infection Survey, published from 6 October 2021 onwards. Previously, when the number of reinfections was low, we estimated the number of reinfections over time and were unable to consider factors, such as vaccination status, that can influence an individual's risk of experiencing a possible reinfection event. Since we first began monitoring reinfections, they have increased allowing us to estimate reinfection rates in the context of vaccination status, patient-facing occupations, and what type of variant was dominant at the time, as well as other factors. Details are available in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of reinfections of COVID-19: June 2021.\nTables 1a to 1e in the\u00a0accompanying dataset\u00a0to this bulletin provide the updated data.\nThe analysis presented in this section includes individuals who have had at least one positive test recorded in the survey and meet our criteria for being \"at risk\" of reinfection where:\n120 days has elapsed since an individual's first positive test in the survey and their most recent test result was negative\nif 120 days has not passed since their first positive test in the survey, the individual's last positive test has been followed by four consecutive negative tests\nAn individual being classified as \"at risk\" reflects that it is possible for a test of theirs to be considered a reinfection if it turns out to be positive. The \"at-risk period\" refers to the period following the first time we could have defined a reinfection. A reinfection is therefore defined as when an individual who meets these criteria has a positive test.\nAll estimates of COVID-19 reinfections in this analysis are unweighted. The sample for this analysis includes only those who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a swab test, and so there is no known population of which weighted estimates could be representative.\nThe analysis includes 20,262 participants \"at risk\" of reinfection and 296 reinfections identified between 2 July 2020 and 25 September 2021. The median time between positive episodes in those with reinfections was 203 days (tables 1a and 1b in our accompanying dataset).\nThe number of reinfections is low overall, and reinfections with a high viral load (which are more likely to cause illness) are even lower. The estimated rate for all reinfections including those with a lower viral load was 11.8 per 100,000 participant days at risk (95% confidence interval: 10.5. to 13.2) over the entire at-risk period. The estimated rate for reinfections with a high viral load (strong positive test where Cycle Threshold (Ct values) were less than 30), was 5.5 per 100,000 participant days at risk (95% confidence interval: 4.6 to 6.5) over the entire at-risk period. Participant days at risk and Ct values are further defined in our glossary.\nAfter 17 May 2021 significant numbers of Delta infections were observed in the survey. Therefore, we have looked at the difference between initial infections and reinfections in terms of viral load before and from this time to understand more about the impact variants have on the viral load of those experiencing reinfections. Analysis of Ct values between the first infection episode and second infection episode for individuals with suspected reinfections, before 17 May 2021, show that the median Ct value was higher (indicating a lower viral load) at second infection than at first infection. However, after 17 May 2021, there appears to be less difference between Ct value distribution at the first and second infection episodes. These findings suggest viral loads at reinfection tend to be higher where reinfections are predominantly from the Delta variant, compared with other variants.\nThe estimated rate of COVID-19 reinfection according to additional Ct analysis can be found in the\u00a0accompanying dataset\u00a0for this bulletin.\nThis section presents updated analysis of the risk factors associated with a COVID-19 reinfection identified among participants across the UK between 2 July 2020 and 20 September 2021. Previously, when the number of reinfections was low, we estimated the number of reinfections over time and were unable to consider factors, such as vaccination status, that can influence an individual's risk of experiencing a possible reinfection event. Since we first began monitoring reinfections, the number has increased allowing us to estimate reinfection rates in the context of vaccination status, patient-facing occupations, and the type of variant that was dominant at the time.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of reinfections of COVID-19: June 2021 outlines the model used to investigate how the rate of reinfection varies over time and between individuals. This model explores multiple factors including age, sex, ethnicity, cycle threshold (Ct) value observed in the initial infection, deprivation, household size, work in patient-facing healthcare, long-term health conditions, vaccination status and the period during which an individual was at risk. We define the Alpha-dominant period as prior to 17 May 2021, and the Delta-dominant period from 17 May 2021.\nFor updated methodology, please refer to our technical article.\nResults are presented as hazard ratios (see glossary) which give the risk of reinfection in a specified group compared with the risk of reinfection in a reference group. When a characteristic (for example, being female) has a hazard ratio greater than one, this means that there is an increased risk of reinfection compared with a reference category (for example, being male). A hazard ratio lower than one means that there is a decreased risk of reinfection compared with the reference category.\nThe analysis includes 20,155 participants \"at risk\" of reinfection and 285 reinfections identified between 2 July 2020 and 20 September 2021. The median time between positive episodes in those with reinfections was 201 days.\nThe risk of reinfection was higher in the period after 17 May 2021 compared with the period before, this reflects a higher risk of reinfection during the period when the Delta variant of COVID-19 was the dominant strain.\nOverall, reinfections were more likely to happen the further a participant was from their initial infection and in those participants with a lower viral load (high Ct value) during their initial infection episode.\nTables 2a to 2c in the accompanying dataset to this bulletin provide relevant data.\nDownload the data\nFigure 2 shows that the risk of reinfection is higher in primary infections with higher Ct values (lower viral load); this may be because of a weaker immune response in \"milder\" primary infections. For example, individuals with an initial infection with a Ct value of 35 or more were twice as likely to get reinfected compared with those with a first infection with a Ct value of 20. Risk of reinfection and associated confidence intervals for Ct values below 20 as compared with the reference category are available in our accompanying dataset. Confidence intervals for these values are wide owing to fewer reinfections within this group.\nDownload the data\nTo show how a person's risk of reinfection changes over time, we focus on a \"reference category\" of person and present how the risk of reinfection has changed for individuals within that category. The rates presented here are for people aged 60 years, who are male, in a non-patient facing healthcare role, live in an area of median deprivation, a household size of 3, have no long-term health condition, a higher viral load in their first infection (Ct value of 20), have not received a second dose of the vaccine and are currently in the \"Alpha\" period (prior to 17 May 2021).\nOverall, this analysis confirms that reinfections become more likely the longer participants are \"at risk\" for reinfection. Figure 3 shows how the estimated rate of reinfection increases as the number of days at risk increase.\nDownload the data\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19, UK Dataset | Released 6 October 2021 Characteristics of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. \n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.

For more detailed information on our methods you can view our methodology article. You can also read our article to find out more about comparing methods used in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace to better understand comparisons in data sources.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the population living in private residential households. We exclude those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. In communal establishments, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nMore information on COVID-19 and taking part in our survey\nFor more information, please visit the CIS participant guidance page.\nIf you have any further questions, please email the CIS operations team: COVID-19@ons.gov.uk.\nFind the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.\nExplore the latest coronavirus data from the ONS and other sources.\nView all coronavirus data.\nFind out how we are working safely in our studies and surveys.\nEarly management information from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey is made available to government decision-makers to inform their response to COVID-19. Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases among the population living in private households, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other communal establishments\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 2 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) increased in England and decreased in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In the same week, the trend was uncertain in Wales.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wider and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall changing picture for England is a result of the different trends across regions. In the four weeks leading up to 2 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across regions. In the week ending 2 October, the percentage of people testing positive increased in all regions except the East of England, where the trend was uncertain. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 26 September to 2 October 2021 for sub-regions in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age 2 years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying England dataset. \n\n\n\nAs with the regional picture, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across age groups. In the week ending 2 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those in school years 7 to 11, age 35 to 49 years and those aged 70 years and over. In the same week, the percentage of people testing positive decreased for those in school year 12 to aged 24 years. The trend was uncertain for those aged 2 years to school Year 6, aged 25 to 34 years and aged 50 to 69 years in the week ending 2 October 2021.\nThe percentage of people testing positive was highest in young people at secondary school. In the week ending 2 October 2021, 6.93% (95% credible interval: 6.24% to 7.70%) of children in school Year 7 to school Year 11 tested positive for COVID-19.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 22 August to 2 October 2021. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. They relate to a six-week time period and are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously, which relates only to the latest week, and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggest that the percentage testing positive increased in young people in recent weeks. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison to England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider confidence intervals. In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive increased for children in recent weeks, but the trend was uncertain for older age groups. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive decreased for children and young adults in recent weeks, but the trend remained uncertain for older age groups.\nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 18 September 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases increased in England and decreased in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In the same week, the trend in the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases was uncertain in Wales. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish Cycle-threshold (Ct) values, which indicate viral load and act as a proxy for the strength of the virus. We also break down infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance:\nUK Variants of Concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nSince the end of July 2021, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant. Because of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included a breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where you can find more details. Our methods article gives more detail about how we sequence the virus\u2019 genetic material. \nOur technical dataset contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence. \nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog and in our methodology article. \nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2013 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and our blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England  Dataset | Released 8 October 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland  Dataset | Released 8 October 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland  Dataset | Released 8 October 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales  Dataset | Released 8 October 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data  Dataset | Released 8 October 2021  Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

Our weekly deaths figures have since shown periods of deaths above average. High excess mortality means that it may take years for mortality rates to return to what would be expected without the pandemic. We will continue to monitor this. \n\n\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a large impact on the number of deaths in 2020 and 2021 and was the main reason deaths increased above average in those years. Mortality displacement is a phenomenon by which a period of high mortality can be followed by below-average mortality. Mortality displacement occurs when vulnerable people, such as older people and those who already had medical conditions, die sooner than expected. Therefore, these individuals are not dying in the following days, weeks, or months, where they would likely have died, potentially leading to a lower-than-average period of mortality.\nWe can measure excess mortality and observe possible mortality displacement by calculating the difference between expected weekly deaths in a non-pandemic period (2015 to 2019 average) and observed weekly deaths in 2020 and 2021. The 2015 to 2019 average is used for both 2020 and 2021, to represent what we would expect in a non-pandemic time. \nThe number of death occurrences from 28 December until mid-March 2020 was generally below average, continuing the decreased number of deaths seen in 2019 compared with previous years (Figure 1). This was followed by a period of excess deaths which peaked on 8 April 2020 when the number of deaths was 3,281 (1,805 above average). Although the number of excess deaths fell below average on 57 out of 124 days between 12 June and 13 October 2020, this was not enough to offset the increased deaths seen earlier in the year and was followed by another period of excess deaths, with a peak of 2,859 deaths (1,078 deaths above average) on 19 January 2021. From the end of February 2021 to 2 July 2021, the number of deaths was generally below average.\nExcess deaths can be summed over time (cumulative excess) to measure the total difference from expected mortality. The cumulative number of deaths is the total above average for the whole period up to a given date. If numbers of deaths fall below average, the cumulative excess can go down instead of up and return to what we would expect in a non-pandemic period. \nBetween the 28 December and 14 March 2020, there were 7,430 deaths fewer than expected compared with the 2015 to 2019 average for the same period (Figure 2; shown as 0 on the vertical axis). By 1 April 2020, the number of deaths was 1,112 deaths above average. Cumulative excess deaths continued to rise, reaching a peak of 97,749 by 24 February 2021. Despite the falling number of deaths and a period of deaths below average, total deaths between 28 December 2019 and 2 July 2021 were still well above average, with 82,797 deaths more than we would expect.\nFigure 1 suggests that we have seen some mortality displacement, as there was a sustained period of fewer deaths than average following the second wave of the pandemic until 2 July 2021. However, Figure 2 shows that the mortality displacement currently seen does not account for the great majority of the excess deaths during the pandemic. In total, between 28 December 2019 to 2 July 2021, there were 109,009 excess deaths in the periods when deaths were above average, and a deficit of 26,212 deaths in periods when deaths were below average.\nA similar pattern can be seen when looking at death registrations. Death registration data is analysed from this point forward, rather than date of occurrence, because of the time taken for deaths to be registered. See the Glossary and Data sources and quality sections for more information.\nFrom week ending 3 January 2020 to 2 July 2021, there were 918,767 deaths registered in England and Wales, of which 125,175 deaths were due to COVID-19. This is 97,981 more deaths than would usually be registered in this time, compared with the 2015 to 2019 five-year average (820,786 deaths). \nMortality rates allow comparability between different time periods and places by adjusting for population size and age structure. Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) indicate the deaths per 100,000 people and are used here to calculate a relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate (rcASMR). \nrcASMRs express the percentage change in excess mortality up to a given date compared with the expected mortality rate in the same period, based on the 2015 to 2019 average. This lets us describe excess mortality and mortality displacement taking into account differences in populations. \nFor example, an rcASMR of 0.0% indicates that the ASMR from the beginning of 2020 to a given week was exactly as we would expect compared with the five-year average. A negative rate indicates mortality rates were below expected, whereas a positive rate indicates above expected. So an rcASMR of 10.0% would indicate that the ASMRs from the beginning of 2020 until that week were 10.0% above average. Figure 3 provides an example of changes in excess deaths effect on subsequent rcASMRs using artificial data.\n\n!\n\nWeekly cumulative excess deaths and the rcASMR are not always linear. This is because the rcASMR is the relative difference between the expected and observed cumulative ASMR, which considers changes in the population structure. Whereas cumulative excess deaths are the numerical difference between expected and observed number of deaths. As such, the ASMR may decrease if the estimated population increases, even if number of deaths increase.\n\n\n\nIn England and Wales, the relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate (rcASMR) was lower than expected before the start of the pandemic. The lowest rcASMR was in week ending 20 March 2020, at 1.5% below average (Figure 4). \nBy week ending 29 May 2020, the rate increased to 4.7% above average, further increasing to 8.2% higher than expected in week ending 26 February 2021. There was some small displacement seen in the summer of 2020, but this was not enough to reduce the excess mortality seen during the first wave of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Deaths were then generally below average, however when looking between week ending 3 January 2020 and 2 July 2021 the rate was still higher than expected at 5.6% above the five-year average. \nThe decrease in excess mortality rates suggests that we have experienced some mortality displacement in England and Wales, but this was not enough to counter the large increase in excess deaths seen during the pandemic. Therefore, it could take some more time for the extent of the displacement to become fully apparent. Data for England and Wales separately, as well as breakdowns for males and females, showed a similar pattern; this can be found in the accompanying dataset.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, the two oldest age groups had the highest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate (rcASMR) above expected, however from 12 February 2021 the rates were predominantly decreasing in both age groups (Figure 5). For both age groups, the percentage change from expected decreased but remained above average, both showing deaths for the period at 4.0% above average by 2 July 2021. \nPeople aged under 65 years recorded the highest rcASMR of all age groups, at 9.7% above what we would expect by 26 March 2021. The rate for those aged under 65 years remained similar to 2 July 2021, at 9.6% above average. We had not seen any mortality displacement in those aged under 65 years by 2 July 2021, the age group with usually the lowest mortality.\nExcess mortality in older age groups declining at a greater rate than younger age groups is indicative of mortality displacement. This is because people in older age groups are more likely to have died of other causes in the following weeks or months without the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Whereas we would expect those in younger age groups to live much longer, therefore their deaths have been displaced outside of the period of this analysis. \nWhen looking from oldest to youngest, the peak rcASMR occurs at an earlier week in the observed period (Table 1). This may be because of the protective effect of the COVID-19 vaccine, which was largely made available to older people first. \nPeople from older age groups were more likely to have died earlier in the pandemic than those in younger age groups. For example, at the peak of the first wave (week ending 5 June 2020) the rcASMR for people aged 85 to 89 years was 5.5% above what we would expect. While the rate for those aged under 65 years was 3.5% above average. \nAll English regions and Wales reported their lowest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates (rcASMRs) between week ending 6 March 2020 and 27 March 2020; all of these rates were below the five-year average. \nThe English region that reported the lowest rcASMR was London, at 2.0% below what would be expected (Figure 6). However, London consistently had the highest rcASMR above average from week ending 3 April 2020. The highest rate for London occurred in week ending 26 February 2021, at 14.8% above what we would expect. Deaths in London were then generally below average, decreasing the rate for the region to 11.8% above what we would expect by 2 July 2021.\nThe South West of England consistently had the lowest rcASMR from week ending 10 April 2020. The highest rate for the South West occurred in week ending 12 February 2021 at 2.2% above what we would expect. Deaths within the region were then generally below average, with the rcASMR returning to equal that of what we would expect in a non-pandemic period by 21 May 2021. The rate continued to decrease, reaching 0.7% below what we would expect by 2 July 2021. The South West was the only region to have the rcASMR return to what we would expect in a non-pandemic period by 2 July 2021.\nWales\u2019 lowest rcASMR was in week ending 13 March 2020 at 1.3% below what we would expect. The highest rate was in week ending 5 February 2021 at 6.2% above what we would expect. Deaths were then generally below average, with the rate decreasing to 3.5% above expected when looking between the beginning of 2020 and 2 July 2021. From week ending 10 April 2020 to 2 July 2021, Wales consistently showed less difference to the five-year average compared with England.\nIn England and Wales, the relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate (rcASMR) in hospitals was 1.5% above what we would expect by week ending 15 May 2020 (Figure 7). The lowest rate for deaths in hospitals occurred in week ending 16 October 2020 at 2.4% below average, and the highest in week ending 19 February 2021 at 2.6% above what we would expect. Deaths in hospitals were then generally below average, returning to equal that what we would expect in a non-pandemic time by week ending 30 April 2021. The rate continued to decrease, reaching 2.2% below average by 2 July 2021.\nThese decreases in deaths occurring in hospitals are likely to reflect a higher than usual proportion of people dying at home. This could indicate patients are not being admitted to hospital or being discharged sooner. For deaths at older ages, it could be that individuals choose to die at home rather than be admitted to hospital. This is another form of displacement, indirectly caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, rather than a direct consequence of deaths occurring sooner because of the pandemic. \nFor deaths in care homes, the lowest rcASMR was in week ending 20 March 2020 at 1.9% below average. The highest was in week ending 5 June 2020 at 11.4% above average. Deaths in care homes then generally decreased, to 5.5% above what we would expect by 2 July 2021.\nDeaths in private homes continued to increase above what we would expect throughout the pandemic. The highest rate was in week ending 2 July 2021 at 25.4% above average. A future release on Deaths in private homes, England and Wales will be released shortly.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the number of expected deaths vary greatly across these locations, for example, the number of deaths that usually occur in hospitals are much greater than in private homes. Therefore, the excess mortality rate for private homes indicates a greater percentage change because of a much lower expected mortality.\nThis section looks at excess mortality by Office for National Statistics (ONS) leading causes of death groupings. For more information, see the Data sources and quality section.\nThe highest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate (rcASMR) for deaths due to dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease was in week ending 29 May 2020, at 4.3% above average. The rate consistently decreased thereafter, returning to what we would expect in a non-pandemic period by week ending 15 January 2021. By week ending 2 July 2021, the rcASMR was 7.7% below average.\nThe other leading causes considered showed either consistently higher than average (symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions, diabetes, hypertensive diseases) or consistently lower than average (all other cause groupings shown) mortality throughout the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic period. \nDeaths due to symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions consistently showed the greatest rcASMR above average. This grouping includes old age and frailty as well as ill-defined symptoms where diagnosis is not classifiable elsewhere. The lowest rate for deaths due to this was in week ending 3 January 2020 at 0.2% above what we would expect. Weekly deaths due to this cause generally increased week-on-week to 19.8% above average by 2 July 2021, the highest rate for this cause. \nDeaths due to influenza and pneumonia consistently showed the rcASMR most below average. The highest rate for this cause was in week ending 3 January 2020 at 0.2% below what we would expect. The lowest rate was reported in week ending 2 July 2021, at 42.3% below average. This is likely in part because of coronavirus restrictions and guidance, such as social distancing, reducing the spread of infections generally.\nThis information looks at the underlying cause of death as indicated on death certificates. When looking at deaths by mention on death certificates, there may be slightly different patterns, as can be seen in Excess mortality in England: weekly reports from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. \nA death certificate can have up to 15 conditions mentioned as contributing towards the death, of which multiple can be from the same cause grouping. By examining mentions on death certificates, we can observe the relationship between coronavirus (COVID-19) and leading causes.\nBetween week ending 13 March 2020 (when the first death due to COVID-19 was registered) and 2 July 2021, there were 125,175 deaths due to COVID-19. Across all these deaths, 1,910 different conditions were reported as contributory causes, with a combined total of 477,370 mentions on all death certificates due to COVID-19.\nThe most common leading cause of death grouping mentioned on death certificates was influenza and pneumonia, accounting for 13.9% of all mentions on COVID-19 death certificates (Table 2). These contributory causes are more likely to be pneumonia than influenza, as pneumonia can be a symptom of COVID-19.\nDiabetes was the most common underlying cause of death that involved COVID-19, with 3.7% of all deaths due to the cause mentioning COVID-19 on the death certificate (see Table 3). This could explain why deaths due to diabetes have increased above average; although the underlying cause of death is diabetes, COVID-19 contributed towards the death. \n\nExcess mortality and mortality displacement in England and Wales: 2020 to mid-2021  Dataset | Released 15 October 2021  Deaths registered in England and Wales by week, from 28 December 2019 to 2 July 2021.

See Impact of registration delays.\nThis articles uses leading causes of death groupings, categorising causes using the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10), specially designed for determining the leading causes of death.\nThe following leading cause of death groupings were investigated for this analysis. These were selected based on the assumption that their observed mortality was most likely to have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nCerebrovascular diseases (I60-I69); leading cause of death, 2015 to 2019.\nChronic lower respiratory diseases (J40-J47); leading cause of death, 2015 to 2019.\nDementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (F01, F03, G30); leading cause of death, 2015 to 2019.\nDiabetes (E10-E14); pre-existing condition of deaths registered due to COVID-19 in 2020.\nHypertensive diseases (I10-I15); pre-existing condition of deaths registered due to COVID-19 in 2020.\nIschaemic heart diseases (I20-I25); leading cause of death, 2015 to 2019.\nInfluenza and pneumonia (J09-J18); consequence mentioned on a certificate of death due to COVID-19 in 2020.\nMalignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus, and lung (C33-C34); leading cause of death, 2015 to 2019.\nSymptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions (R00-R99); consequence mentioned on a certificate of death due to COVID-19 in 2020.\nRelative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates (rcASMRs) were developed by the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) and originally described in working paper 111 (PDF, 1.07MB). Rather than number of deaths, rcASMRs sum all age-standardised mortality rates between two time points. \nIn this article, rcASMRs are calculated cumulatively from week ending 3 January 2020 to 2 July 2021, relative to the 2015 to 2019 average cumulative age-standardised mortality rate (cASMR) for that 79-week period. This difference is expressed as a percentage of the average cASMR for Week 79 of the time period, equivalent to the average 79-week rate.\nOf the 2015 to 2019 five-year average, 2015 was the only year to include a Week 53, making it difficult to draw a meaningful comparison for Week 53, 2020. To adjust for this, pseudo-Week 53s were calculated for 2016 to 2019, from an average of the Week 52 age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) and Week 1 ASMR of the following year.\nTo generate a 79-week period for this analysis, the average cASMRs for Week 1 to 26 were appended onto the Week 53 cASMR. This allows for a continuous measure to be used across a 79-week period, while also allowing for a meaningful comparison to be drawn between Week 1 2021, and the appended Week 1 average cASMR.\nWeekly cumulative excess deaths and the rcASMR are not always linear. This is because ASMRs consider population size and age-structure at a given week; if the population changes, as does the rate of death per 100,000 people. As such, the ASMR may decrease if the estimated population increases, even if number of deaths increase.\nMid-year population estimates were used for the populations of 2015 to 2020 and population projections (2018 based) were used for the population of 2021. These are calculated based on expected values of the population on July 1 of each year. Between these dates, weekly population estimates have been calculated by means of linear interpolation. For example:\nWriting P(x,s,w,y) for the population in week w of year y, we set P(x,s,1,y) equal to the population estimates at July 1 and calculate exposure by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to thank Heidi Wilson, Sarah Caul, Rachel Rushton, Sion Ward, Annie Campbell, Neil Hopper, Ryan Schofield, Alexander Cooke and Danielle Cornish for their valued contribution to this article.\n", "summary": "Mortality displacement did not offset excess deaths by mid-2021\nThere is some evidence of mortality displacement during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, but not enough to offset the high number of deaths.\nMortality displacement occurs when vulnerable people die sooner than expected. Therefore, these individuals are not dying in the following days, weeks, or months, where they would likely have died, potentially leading to a lower-than-average period of mortality.\nSome of the deaths that occurred during the pandemic, mainly seen in older age groups and in hospitals, likely would have occurred in the following weeks or months, when mortality was below average.\nHowever, these periods of below average mortality did not offset the high number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.\nOverall, from the week ending 3 January 2020 to 2 July 2021, there were 97,981 excess deaths in England and Wales (compared to what we would expect in a non-pandemic period).\nWe are yet to see any evidence that deaths in those aged under 65 years or in private homes would have occurred over the following weeks or months, as cumulative deaths have not returned to what we would expect.\nThis analysis uses relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates (rcASMR), which express the percentage change in excess mortality up to a given date compared to the expected mortality rate in the same period, based on the 2015 to 2019 average.\n", "id": 94}, {"document": "In Week 39, 10,510 deaths were registered in England and Wales; this was 174 fewer deaths than the previous week (Week 38) and 12.1% above the five-year average (1,133 more deaths).\nThe number of deaths registered in England in the week ending 1 October 2021 (Week 39) was 9,833; this was 124 fewer deaths than the previous week (Week 38) and 12.5% above the five-year average (1,089 more deaths).\nThe number of deaths registered in Wales in the week ending 1 October 2021 (Week 39) was 653; this was 58 fewer deaths than the previous week (Week 38) and 8.1% above the five-year average (49 more deaths).\nOf the deaths registered in Week 39 in England and Wales, 783 mentioned \"novel coronavirus (COVID-19)\", accounting for 7.5% of all deaths; this was a decrease compared with Week 38 (888 deaths).\nThe number of deaths involving COVID-19 in England decreased to 715 in Week 39, compared with 799 in Week 38; for Wales, deaths involving COVID-19 decreased to 64 in Week 39, compared with 88 in Week 38.\nThe number of deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 1 October 2021 was 12,132, which was 1,423 more than the five-year average; of deaths registered in the UK in Week 39, 972 involved COVID-19, which was 138 fewer than in Week 38.\nThe provisional number of deaths registered in England and Wales decreased from 10,684 in Week 38 (week ending 24 September 2021) to 10,510 in Week 39 (week ending 1 October 2021).

Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wider and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nIn the week ending 9 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in all regions except the North East, the East Midlands and London. In the North East, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the two weeks up to 9 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the week ending 9 October 2021. In the same week, the trend was uncertain in the East Midlands and London. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 3 to 9 October 2021 for sub-regions in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"aged two years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11 to 12-year-olds and 16 to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 9 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased for those in school Years 7 to 11, those aged 50 to 69 years and those aged 70 years and over. The percentage of people testing positive increased for those aged two years to school Year 6 and those aged 35 to 49 years in the two weeks up to 9 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the week up to 9 October 2021. In the same week, there were early signs of an increase in the percentage of people testing positive for those in school Year 12 to those aged 24 years. The trend was uncertain for those aged 25 to 34 years in the week ending 9 October 2021.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was highest for those in school Years 7 to 11 at 8.10% (95% credible interval: 7.31% to 8.90%) in the week ending 9 October 2021.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries from 29 August to 9 October 2021. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. These estimates relate to a six-week time period and are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously, which relates only to the latest week, and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggest that the percentage testing positive increased in children in recent weeks, but the trend was uncertain for adults. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison to England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider confidence intervals. In Wales, the percentage testing positive increased in children and those aged 40 to 60 years in recent weeks, but the trend was uncertain for other adult ages. In Northern Ireland, the percentage testing positive decreased in young adults and older age groups, but the trend continues to fluctuate in children. In Scotland, the percentage testing positive decreased for those aged under 60 years in recent weeks, but the trend was uncertain for those aged 60 years and over.\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 25 September 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases continued to increase in England and increased in Wales. The number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases continued to decrease in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish\u00a0Cycle-threshold (Ct) values, which indicate viral load and act as a proxy for the strength of coronavirus (COVID-19).\u00a0We also break down infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for\u00a0Variants of Concern. These are variants that the UK government has\u00a0under surveillance:\nUK Variants of Concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nSince the end of July 2021, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant. Because of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included a breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where you can find more details. Our\u00a0methods article\u00a0gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nOur\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog\u00a0and in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2013 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 15 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 15 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 15 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 15 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 15 October 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

This was 4,656 more deaths than in September 2020 and 7,215 deaths more than the five-year average (2015 to 2019) (19.4% higher).\nThe five-year average has been provided for 2015 to 2019 (rather than 2016 to 2020) because of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on deaths registered in 2020. The average for 2015 to 2019 provides a comparison of the number of deaths expected in a usual (non-pandemic) year.\nIn Wales, the provisional number of deaths registered in September 2021 was 2,964. This was 354 more deaths than in September 2020 and 489 more deaths than the five-year average for September (19.8% higher).\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) are used for comparisons over time rather than numbers of deaths, as ASMRs account for changes to the population size and age structure. In England, mortality rates for the month of September generally decreased over time from 1,157.1 per 100,000 people in September 2003 to a low of 794.0 deaths per 100,000 people in September 2018. This was followed by significant increases in ASMR in September 2019 and 2020 (840.7 and 885.5 deaths per 100,000 people respectively). In September 2021, mortality rates significantly increased compared with the previous year, to 966.2 deaths per 100,000 people. This pattern in ASMRs over time was seen in both males and females (Figure 1).\nIn Wales, mortality rates for September were also generally decreasing over time, but these improvements stalled from September 2012 onwards, in line with previous findings on changing trends in mortality. The ASMR decreased from 1,213.2 deaths per 100,000 people in September 2003, to a low of 867.6 deaths per 100,000 people in September 2018. This was followed by an increase in ASMR in September 2019 (897.2 deaths per 100,000) and in September 2020 (946.2 deaths per 100,000). However, these increases were not statistically significant. In September 2021, the mortality rate was 1,056.4 deaths per 100,000 people which was statistically significantly higher than the previous year.\nThe doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death, and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death. Using this information, we determine an underlying cause of death. More information on this process can be found in our user guide.\nSince March 2020 (when the first deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) were registered in England and Wales), where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate it was the underlying cause of death in most cases (88.8% in England, 87.4% in Wales). For more information on our definition of COVID-19 deaths, see Section 10: Measuring the data.\n\n!\n\nIn this bulletin, we use the term \"due to COVID-19\" when referring only to deaths with an underlying cause of death of COVID-19 and we use the term \"involving COVID-19\" when referring to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether as an underlying cause or not.\n\n\n\nOf the 44,474 deaths registered in September 2021 in England, 6.6% (2,955 deaths) were due to COVID-19, a larger proportion than in August 2021 (5.3%). Including all deaths involving COVID-19 (3,432 deaths) increases the percentage to 7.7% of all deaths in England in September 2021.\nIn Wales, 8.5% of the 2,964 deaths registered in September 2021 were due to COVID-19 (253 deaths), a larger proportion than in August 2021 (2.7%). Including all deaths involving COVID-19 (289 deaths) increases the percentage to 9.8% of all deaths in Wales.\nIn both England and Wales, the numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 increased compared with August 2021 but continued to be lower than the numbers seen in October 2020 to March 2021.\nWhen adjusting for the size and age structure of the population, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths due to COVID-19 in England for September 2021 showed statistically significant increases compared with August 2021. The ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 increased to 64.4 deaths per 100,000 people in September 2021 (compared with 45.7 in August 2021). In Wales, the ASMR significantly increased to 89.6 deaths per 100,000 people in September 2021 (compared with 24.5 in August 2021). September 2021 is the first month since December 2020 where the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 is higher than in England. \nIn England, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly increased in September 2021 for males (85.3 deaths per 100,000 males) and females (47.9 deaths per 100,000 females) compared with August 2021.\nIn September 2021, the ASMRs for deaths due to COVID-19 in Wales significantly increased compared with August 2021 in both males (106.9 deaths per 100,000 males) and females (77.9 deaths per 100,000 females).\nMore information on mortality rates by sex is available in Tables 3a and 3b of the accompanying dataset.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

In Wales, ischaemic heart diseases were the leading cause of death, with 100.0 deaths per 100,000 people (284 deaths).\nIn England, coronavirus (COVID-19) was the third leading cause of death in September 2021 (2,955 deaths), remaining consistent with August 2021 (2,162 deaths). In Wales, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death (253 deaths) in September 2021, its highest ranking since March 2021.\nIn England in September 2021, 2 of the 10 leading causes of death were significantly lower than the five-year average (2015 to 2019) and 4 of the 10 leading causes had no significant difference to the five-year average. As seen in previous months, the mortality rate for deaths with an underlying cause of influenza and pneumonia was lower in September 2021 than the five-year average for September (23.9% lower). This is likely in part to be because of people continuing to follow coronavirus guidance, such as social distancing, reducing the spread of infections such as flu.\nSimilar to recent months, in September 2021 symptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions were significantly higher than the five-year average in England. In September 2021, the mortality rate for symptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions was 30.8% higher than the five-average for September. This leading cause group includes mostly deaths with a code for \"old age\" but is also used for causes such as \"frailty\".\nIn Wales in September 2021, mortality rates for 7 of the 10 leading causes were similar to the five-year average (not statistically significantly different). As seen in England, the September 2021 mortality rate for influenza and pneumonia was significantly lower than the five-year average for September (31.5% lower).\nIn the first nine months (January to September) of 2021, the leading cause of death in England was COVID-19 (132.2 deaths per 100,000 population). In Wales the leading cause of death was ischaemic heart diseases (113.2 deaths per 100,000) followed closely by COVID-19 (112.8 deaths per 100,000).\nIn England, the year-to-date COVID-19 mortality rate was significantly higher than the next leading cause of death (dementia and Alzheimer's disease). In Wales, in January to September 2021, the number of deaths due to ischaemic heart diseases and COVID-19 were the same (2,885 deaths each). However, due to the age structure of the deaths the age-standardised mortality rate due to ischaemic heart diseases was the higher than COVID-19. There was no significant difference in mortality rates between the two causes.\nMore information on the 2021 year-to-date leading causes of death is available in Tables 11a and 11b of the accompanying dataset. More in-depth analysis of leading causes of death is available in our annual publication based on finalised mortality data.\nThere were 408,338 deaths registered in England and 26,468 in Wales during the first nine months (January to September) of 2021.\nTo gain a better idea of year-to-year differences in mortality rates, we calculated year-to-date age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) based on deaths registered in January to September of each year from 2001 to 2021 (Figure 5). For England, the year-to-date ASMR for 2021 was 981.1 deaths per 100,000 people, which was significantly lower than the same period in 2020 (1,042.1 deaths per 100,000 people). However, when compared with the same period in 2019 (909.1 deaths per 100,000 people), the 2021 year-to-date mortality rate was significantly higher.\nFor Wales, the year-to-date ASMR for 2021 decreased to 1,041.4 deaths per 100,000 people. This was statistically significantly lower than the same period in 2020 (1,080.2 deaths per 100,000 people). But, as with England, January to September 2021 was significantly higher than the same period in 2019 (984.4 deaths per 100,000 people).\nThis section is based on the date a death occurred - rather than the date of registration used in the previous sections - to monitor current mortality trends. Further information can be found in Section 10: Measuring the data.\nIn England, 37,396 deaths occurred in September 2021 (and were registered by 7 October 2021). This was 373 more deaths than the five-year average (2015 to 2019) for September (1.0% higher). Of all deaths that occurred, 6.9% were due to coronavirus (COVID-19) (2,581 deaths).\nIn Wales, 2,574 deaths occurred in September 2021 (and were registered by 7 October 2021), which was 81 more deaths than the five-year average (3.2% higher). COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death in 9.9% of all deaths that occurred (255 deaths).\nIn England, the first death due to COVID-19 occurred on 30 January 2020 and in Wales the first death due to COVID-19 occurred on the 15 March 2020. Figure 6 shows the trend in COVID-19 death occurrences from March 2020 onwards. \nIt is important to note that the number of death occurrences is incomplete as it is likely that more deaths need to be registered, therefore comparisons should be treated with caution.\nIn particular, instances where the number of death occurrences on each day in September was below the range of the last five years are likely to be a result of when the data extract was created. Specifically, deaths that occurred towards the end of the month may not have been registered by the time the data extract was created. We would therefore expect the number of death occurrences to be higher in future releases.\nData on pre-existing conditions of people who died due to coronavirus (COVID-19) in England and Wales for 2021 can be found in the accompanying dataset.

For more detailed information on our methods you can view our COVID-19 Infection Survey methodology article. You can also read our article to find out more about comparing methods used in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace to better understand comparisons in data sources.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the population living in private residential households. We exclude those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. In communal establishments, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nMore information on COVID-19 and taking part in our survey   For more information, please visit the\u00a0CIS participant guidance\u00a0page.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases among the population living in private households, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other communal establishments\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 16 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to increase in England. In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the two weeks up to 16 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the week ending 16 October 2021. In the same week, the percentage of people testing positive continued to decrease in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the two weeks up to 16 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the week ending 16 October 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wider and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nIn the week ending 16 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) increased in the North West, the East Midlands, the East of England, London and the South West. In the same week, the percentage of people testing positive appeared to level off in the West Midlands and the South East following recent increases. In the same week, the trend was uncertain in the North East and Yorkshire and The Humber. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 10 to 16 October 2021 for sub-regions in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"aged two years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to those aged 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11 to 12-year-olds and 16 to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 16 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 increased in all age groups except for those aged 25 to 34 years where the percentage increased in the two weeks up to 16 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the week up to 16 October 2021.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 remained highest for those in school Years 7 to 11, at 7.80% (95% credible interval: 7.07% to 8.60%), in the week ending 16 October 2021.\nModelled estimates are subject to revision. Please note that in our last publication the estimate of 8.1% for those in school Years 7 to 11 in the week ending 9 October 2021 has been revised to 7.1% in light of additional test results received since publication. The current trend of increasing positivity is unchanged by this revision.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries from 5 September to 16 October 2021. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. These estimates relate to a six-week time period and are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously, which relates only to the latest week, and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison with the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggests that the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 increased in young people in recent weeks, but the trend was uncertain for adults. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison with England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider confidence intervals. In Wales, the percentage testing positive increased in those at primary and secondary school age. There were signs of an increase in those aged around 40 years in recent weeks, but the trend was uncertain for adults at other ages. In Northern Ireland, the percentage testing positive increased in those aged around 70 years and over and decreased in those aged around 30 years. However, the trends are uncertain for children and other adult ages. In Scotland, the percentage testing positive decreased for those aged under 60 years in recent weeks, but the trend was uncertain for those aged 60 years and over.\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 2 October 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases continued to increase in England and Wales and continued to decrease in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases decreased in the two weeks up to 2 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the week ending 2 October 2021. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish\u00a0Cycle-threshold (Ct) values, which indicate viral load and act as a proxy for the strength of the virus. We also break down infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for\u00a0Variants of Concern. These are variants that the UK government has\u00a0under surveillance. You can find out more in the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England briefing document (PDF, 2.51MB).\nUK Variants of Concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nSince the end of July 2021, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant. Because of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included a breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where you can find more details. Our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nOur\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog\u00a0and in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 22 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 22 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 22 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 22 October 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 22 October 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

For more detailed information on our methods you can view our COVID-19 Infection Survey methodology article. You can also find out more about comparing methods used in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace in our article, to better understand comparisons in data sources.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the population living in private residential households. We exclude those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. In communal establishments, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nMore information on COVID-19 and taking part in our survey   For more information, please visit the\u00a0CIS participant guidance\u00a0page.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases among the population living in private households, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other communal establishments\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 22 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to increase in England. In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the two weeks up to 22 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the week ending 22 October 2021. In Scotland, there were early signs of an increase in the percentage of people testing positive in the week ending 23 October 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends. \n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wider and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs, UK, 7 August 2020 to 23 October 2021\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included. \nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across regions in England. In the week ending 22 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the East Midlands, the West Midlands, the East of England, London, the South East and the South West. The percentage of people testing positive increased in the North West in the two weeks up to 22 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. The trend was uncertain in the North East and Yorkshire and The Humber in the week ending 22 October 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nEstimated daily percentage of the population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs by region, England, 11 September to 22 October 2021 \n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 16 to 22 October 2021 for sub-regions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and from 17 to 23 October 2021 for sub-regions in Scotland.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs by sub-regional geography, UK, 16 to 23 October 2021\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"aged two years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to those aged 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 22 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 increased for all age groups, except for those in School year 12 to those aged 24 and for those aged 25 to 34 years, where the trend was uncertain. \nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 remained highest for those in school Years 7 to 11, at 9.14% (95% credible interval: 8.31% to 10.06%) in the week ending 22 October 2021.\nEstimated daily percentage of the population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs by age group, England, 11 September to 22 October 2021 \nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: for England, Wales and Northern Ireland this is presented from 11 September to 22 October 2021, and from 12 September to 23 October 2021 for Scotland. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. These estimates relate to a six-week time period and are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously, which relates only to the latest week, and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggests that the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 increased in those of primary and secondary school age and for those aged around 40 years and over in recent weeks, but the trend was uncertain for other age groups. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison with England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider confidence intervals. In Wales, the percentage testing positive increased for those of primary and secondary school age and decreased for young adults. There were signs of an increase for those aged around 40 years in recent weeks, but the trend was uncertain for adults of other ages. In Northern Ireland, the percentage testing positive increased for those aged around 70 years and over and decreased for those aged around 30 to 40 years. The trends in the percentage testing positive for children, young adults and adults of other ages were uncertain. In Scotland, the percentage testing positive decreased for those of secondary school age and young adults. The trend was uncertain for those of primary school age and the older ages.\nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh.\nEstimated daily percentage of the population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs by single year of age, UK, 11 September to 23 October 2021\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 8 October 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases continued to increase in England and Wales, and an increase was also seen in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases decreased in the two weeks up to 8 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate.

This is because the IPS was not run during this period because of COVID-19.\nOverseas residents made a total of 277,000 visits to the UK during Quarter 2 (April to June) 2021, a decrease of 97% compared with Quarter 2 (April to June) 2019.\nVisits to the UK by overseas visitors were low in Quarter 2 2021 when compared with Quarter 2 2019. Visiting friends and relatives decreased by 93% to 173,000, holiday visits decreased by 99.6% to 13,000 and business trips decreased by 97% to 44,000.\nEstimated spending in the UK by overseas visitors decreased by 94% to \u00a3386 million in Quarter 2 2021 when compared with Quarter 2 2019. Similar levels of decrease were seen for all areas of the world.\nUK residents made 1 million visits abroad by air in Quarter 2 (April to June) 2021, 95% fewer than the same quarter in 2019. The largest number of visits was made to Europe (733,000), a fall of 96%. \nHolidays were the least likely reason for UK residents' visits abroad. In Quarter 2 2021, there were just 173,000 holidays. Visits to friends or relatives were the most common reason for travelling, accounting for 60% of all visits (602,000).\nUK residents spent \u00a31,122 million during visits abroad in Quarter 2 2021. This was a decrease of 93% when compared with the same period in 2019.\nWe are currently reviewing the way in which travel and tourism statistics are produced. Our review provides the opportunity to gather a comprehensive understanding of user needs, and to explore how best they can be met in a changing environment.\nThe proposed approach represents a move towards a system that maximises the use of alternative data sources alongside survey data.\nWe are asking organisations and people who use travel and tourism statistics to provide feedback on this\u00a0proposed approach through a user consultation exercise.\nYou can read more about our proposals and feedback on our approach.\nWe have introduced methodological improvements to the travel and tourism estimates from the International Passenger Survey (IPS). These were introduced in the article Travel Trends 2019 and relate to the survey's weighting process. The improvements are described in the article in Improved methodology for the estimates in outline. A detailed technical report will be published in due course, setting out the changes comprehensively. These changes affect only travel and tourism and not estimates of long-term international migration.\nThe estimates presented in this article for the whole of 2020 must be treated with particular caution, since the methods used have not been fully scrutinised or tested.\nEstimates for Quarter 2 2021 are based on passengers travelling by air only and percentage differences shown are a comparison with visits by air during Quarter 2 2019. \nThe accuracy of the estimates is expressed in terms of\u00a0confidence intervals, which are shown in the datasets associated with this publication.

Interviews are carried out at air and sea ports, on board vessels leaving or returning to the UK, or on board the Eurotunnel Trains. Interviews are carried out on all days of the year, apart from Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day.\nFurther guidance is available about the quality of overseas travel and tourism estimates in the IPS QMI report. This report will be updated shortly to reflect recent changes to the survey's processes.\n", "summary": "International air travel has substantially decreased since 2019\nThe number of people travelling to and from the UK by air has decreased by 97% since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe International Passenger Survey (IPS), which collects details from overseas residents leaving the UK, and UK residents returning home, shows overseas residents made 277,000 visits by air to the UK during Quarter 2 (April to June) 2021.\nThis was 97% fewer than Quarter 2 2019 as travel continues to be restricted because of COVID-19. People travelling to visit friends and relatives decreased by 93% to 173,000, holiday visits decreased by 99.6% to 13,000 and business trips decreased by 97% to 44,000.\nOverseas residents spent \u00a3386 million on their visits to the UK in Quarter 2 2021; this was 94% less than their spend in Quarter 2 2019.\nUK residents made 1 million visits abroad by air in Quarter 2 2021, which was 95% fewer than Quarter 2 2019. The largest number of visits was made to Europe (733,000); a fall of 96% in comparison to Quarter 2 2019.\nUK residents spent \u00a31,122 million on visits abroad in Quarter 2 2021; this was 93% less than in Quarter 2 2019.\nThe data collected from the IPS is for air travel only therefore all of the comparisons in this analysis are between air travel for 2019 and 2021.\nThis is because sea and tunnel data could not be collected because of COVID-19 restrictions. However, overall sea and tunnel numbers provided by administrative data show a similar decrease as air travel. Sea and tunnel numbers constitute approximately 20% of all traffic before the pandemic.\n", "id": 109}, {"document": "Between 2 January and 24 September 2021, the age-adjusted risk of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) was 32 times greater in unvaccinated people than in fully vaccinated individuals.\nThe weekly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving COVID-19 were consistently lower for people who had received two vaccinations compared with one or no vaccinations.\nASMRs take into account differences in age structure and population size to allow comparisons between vaccination status groups; however some differences between the groups such as health status may remain and partly explain the differences in ASMRs.\n\n!\n\nThis bulletin is an update to our previous article \"Deaths involving COVID-19 by vaccination status, England: deaths occurring between 2 January and 2 July 2021\". \n\n\n\nBecause vaccinations were being offered according to priority groups set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the characteristics of the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations are changing over time. To account for differences in population size and age structure of the vaccination status groups over time, we calculated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) (Figure 1) using the Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) dataset (see Measuring the data). This is a dataset containing people who reside in England who could be linked to the 2011 Census and the GP Patient Register 2019, which covers approximately 79% of people aged 10 years and over living in England. ASMRs for all-cause deaths and age-specific rates for deaths involving COVID-19 are also included in the accompanying dataset.\nThe vaccination status is split by dose and time since vaccination, to allow for the increase in protection in the first few weeks after vaccination. The vaccination status is one of:\nunvaccinated\nreceived only the first dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived only the first dose, at least 21 days ago\nreceived the second dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived the second dose, at least 21 days ago\nThe ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 and all causes for vaccination status groups over the period 2 January to 24 September 2021 (Week 1 to Week 38) are shown in Table 1. These ASMRs are calculated in person-years at risk to account for the different time people spent in each vaccination state in the period.\nThe ASMRs for total deaths and deaths involving COVID-19 are significantly higher among people who are unvaccinated than people who had received either one or two doses. The ASMR for deaths involving COVID-19 for unvaccinated people is 32 times greater than that of people who had received two doses at least 21 days ago.\n\n!\n\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) can be affected by differing characteristics of the population in the vaccination status groups and the changing COVID-19 infection rate. Therefore, the ASMRs do not show causal links between vaccines and risk of mortality. \n\n\n\nDownload the data\nAs shown in Figure 1, the weekly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for people who had received two vaccination doses are lower than those for people who have received one dose or are unvaccinated in every week of the period. The weekly ASMRs for people who had received only one dose are in general lower than the ASMRs for people who were unvaccinated but higher than those for people who had received two vaccination doses.\nWeekly age-specific mortality rates were calculated for aggregated age groups rather than the usual five-year age groups because of low numbers of deaths in some age groups which could pose a risk of disclosure of the vaccination status of individuals and result in unstable estimates. The age-specific rates are included in the accompanying dataset and can be used to highlight which age groups are driving changes in the age-standardised mortality rates. \n\n!\n\nThe weekly counts of total deaths and deaths involving COVID-19 will not equal those in other Office for National Statistics publications because we use the Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) as the population for the ASMRs. See Glossary. \n\n\n\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) allow for comparison of mortality rates of populations with different age structures, as the population is standardised in five-year age groups to a standard population. Information on how ASMRs are calculated can be found in our Methodology article. Age standardisation is important when comparing mortality rates of different vaccination status groups, as the age structures of the populations differ greatly between the groups and over time.\nWhile the ASMRs provide evidence that vaccinated individuals have a lower risk of dying of coronavirus (COVID-19) than unvaccinated individuals, they cannot be used to determine vaccine effectiveness. This is because the populations in each vaccine status group are likely to differ in ways other than population size and age because of the selective roll out of the vaccination programme and differences in vaccine uptake. Care should be taken in interpreting trends in the ASMRs as these cannot be causally linked to vaccinations. Differences between the groups and over time, such as health status, can have a particularly large effect on the ASMRs, especially when the population becomes unrepresentative of the age group in general. This can happen if people with particular characteristics, such as poor health, remain in a particular vaccination status group.\nFor example, the total mortality rate for the \"21 days or more after first dose\" group increases sharply from approximately week 13 to week 19 (Table 2 of the accompanying dataset). However, looking at\u00a0the percentage of elderly people who are in this vaccination status group (Table 4 of the accompanying dataset), we see that this drops\u00a0to very low levels around\u00a0the same weeks, therefore the mortality rates are based on a very small percentage of the elderly population, which may not be representative of the elderly population in general. For example, this group may include people who did not receive a second vaccination after receiving the first because of being hospitalised for a serious condition. Similar patterns are observed for the \"unvaccinated\" and \"within 21 days of first dose\" groups at earlier times of the year. This effect is much reduced as age decreases.\nTo calculate age-specific mortality rates and age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs), we need to know both the number of deaths and the number of living people in each age group and their vaccination status. There are different approaches to determining the population, which affect the reported mortality rates and ASMRs. If the population is estimated using the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) or people registered with a GP, this can result in an overestimate of the unvaccinated population because of the inclusion of people who have died or moved away. Conversely, using Office for National Statistics (ONS) population estimates and deriving the unvaccinated population as the difference to the number of vaccinated people, could result in underestimating the unvaccinated population if the ONS population estimates are lower than the true value.\nWe used the Public Health Data Asset, a dataset based on the 2011 Census, linked to mortality data and NIMS vaccination data, to obtain both the numerators and denominators for mortality rates. This covers approximately 79% of all people aged 10 years and over and the use of the census linked to GP records means there should be minimal overestimation of the unvaccinated population.\nEstimates of ASMRs by vaccination status are also published by Public Health England. In addition to the use of a different population, these estimates define vaccination status at the date of infection rather than the date of death and therefore are not equivalent to the rates in this bulletin.\nPublished studies have calculated vaccine effectiveness using observational methods, taking into account known differences in characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and confirming the lack of bias because of remaining unobserved differences between the groups. All three vaccines have reported vaccine effectiveness of over 90% against coronavirus (COVID-19) mortality (PDF, 2.29MB).\n\nDeaths by vaccination status, England Dataset | Released 1 November 2021 Weekly age-standardised mortality rates and age-specific rates for deaths involving COVID-19 and all deaths by vaccination status.

You can also find out more about\u00a0comparing methods used in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace\u00a0in our article, to better understand comparisons in data sources.\nOur estimates are based on confirmed positive test results. The remaining swabs are either negative, inconclusive or test failures. We are working with the laboratories to understand consistency in the identification of inconclusive results, that could be weak positive results. The impact of this on our estimates of positive infections is likely to be very small and unlikely to affect the trend.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the population living in private residential households. We exclude those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. In communal establishments, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nMore information on COVID-19 and taking part in our survey   For more information, please visit the\u00a0CIS participant guidance\u00a0page.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases among the population living in private households, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other communal establishments\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 30 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in England has increased more slowly over a two-week period, but the trend was uncertain in the week ending 30 October 2021. In Scotland and in Wales, the trend was uncertain for the percentage of people testing positive in the week up to 30 October 2021. In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive continued to increase in the week ending 30 October 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wider and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across regions in England. In the week ending 30 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the North East and Yorkshire and The Humber. The percentage of people testing positive increased in the West Midlands, East of England and South West in the two weeks up to 30 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. Rates have decreased in the North West and East Midlands over the same week, and there are early signs of a decrease in the South East. The trend is uncertain in London in the week ending 30 October 2021. \u00a0Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 also varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 24 to 30 October 2021.\n.XLSX\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"aged two years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to those aged 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset. \n\n\n\nAs with the regional picture, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across age groups. In the week ending 30 October 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 increased for those in school Year 12 to age 24 years and those aged 50 to 69 years. Rates for those aged over 70 years increased in the two weeks up to 30 October 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. Rates have decreased for school Year 7 to school Year 11 in the most recent week, however rates remain high. The trend was uncertain for all other age groups in the most recent week.\nIt is too early to determine the impact of the half-term holiday on the numbers of infections among school-aged children. This is because the tests that were carried out during the week ending 30 October will have identified positive cases from those who became infected before the half term period. We will continue to closely monitor test results among school aged children.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 remained highest for those in school Years 7 to 11, at 7.47% (95% credible interval: 6.66% to 8.32%) in the week ending 30 October 2021.\n.XLSX\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries, 19 September to 30 October 2021. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. These estimates are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggests the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 in England showed a decrease in children and younger adults. The percentage testing positive increased for older adults. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison with England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider confidence intervals. In Wales, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain across all ages. In Northern Ireland, the percentage testing positive increased for school aged children and older adults, but uncertainty is high. The trend was uncertain for younger adults. In Scotland, the percentage testing positive has decreased since the start of October for children and young adults, although the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. The trend was uncertain for older adults in Scotland.\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\n.XLSX\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 16 October 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases continued to increase in England and Northern Ireland, and there were early signs of an increase in Scotland. In Wales, the trend in the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases was uncertain in the most recent week.\u00a0Credible intervals\u00a0are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish\u00a0Cycle-threshold (Ct) values, which indicate viral load and act as a proxy for the strength of the virus. We also break down infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests.\nThe\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance. You can find out more in the\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England briefing document (PDF, 2.51MB).\nUK Variants of Concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nSince the end of July 2021, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant or a genetic descendant/sub-lineage of the Delta variant. These all have the same gene positivity pattern. Because of this high proportion with the same gene positivity pattern, we have not included a breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where you can find more details. Our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nOur\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog\u00a0and in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low -- under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 5 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 5 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 5 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 5 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 5 November 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency (UK HSA) and Wellcome Trust.

In the week ending 30 October 2021, an estimated 1 in 50 people in England had COVID-19 (1,103,000 people).\nThe percentage of people testing positive continued to increase in Northern Ireland. In Scotland and in Wales, the trend was uncertain in the most recent week.\nThe estimated percentage of people living in private households (not in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments) that had COVID-19 in the most recent week was:\n - 2.02% in England (1 in 50 people), compared with 2.02% (1 in 50 people) the week before\n - 2.39% in Wales (1 in 40 people), compared with 2.56% (1 in 40 people) the week before\n - 1.49 % in Northern Ireland (1 in 65 people), compared with 1.31% (1 in 75 people) the week before\n - 1.25% in Scotland (1 in 80 people), compared with 1.36% (1 in 75 people), the week before\nBy English region, the positivity rate increased in the North East and Yorkshire and The Humber. Trends were uncertain in the West Midlands, London, East of England, and South West in the latest week. Rates have decreased in the North West and East Midlands, with early signs of a decrease in the South East.\n", "id": 113}, {"document": "Patterns of crime in the year ending June 2021 have been significantly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and government instructions to limit social contact. Periods of national lockdown have seen decreases in the incidence of many types of crime. This has generally been followed by a return towards previous incidence levels once lockdowns ended.\nCrime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) estimates provide the best indicator of long-term trends. Estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) for the year ending June 2021 compared with the pre-COVID year ending June 20191 show:\na 12% increase in total crime, driven by a 43% increase in fraud and computer misuse\na 14% decrease in total crime excluding fraud and computer misuse, largely driven by an 18% decrease in theft offences\nlittle change in the total number of incidents of violence but a 27% decrease in the number of victims of violent crime, largely driven by falls in violence where the offender was a stranger2, in part reflecting the closure of the night-time economy for several months of the year\nFraud and computer misuse offences do not follow the lockdown-related pattern of reduced victimisation. Increases in these offences more than offset the reductions seen for other types of crime. Crime survey estimates for the year ending June 2021 compared with the year ending June 2019 show:\na 32% increase in fraud incidents, largely driven by substantial increases in both \u201cconsumer and retail fraud\u201d and \u201cadvance fee fraud\u201d\nan 85% increase in computer misuse incidents, driven entirely by an increase in \u201cunauthorised access to personal information, including hacking\u201d\nPolice recorded crime data show a similar pattern to the crime survey, with overall reductions in the reporting and recording of many crime types during periods of lockdown. These data give more insight into lower-volume but higher-harm crimes that the survey does not cover or does not capture well. Compared with the year ending June 2020 they show:\nan 11% decrease in the number of homicides, to 627 offences (and a 5% fall excluding the Grays lorry incident)\na 6% decrease in the number of police recorded offences involving firearms\nan 8% decrease in offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime)\nSexual offences, as recorded by the police, were also lower during periods of lockdown, but to a lesser extent during the winter 2020 to 2021 lockdown than during the spring 2020 lockdown. The number of sexual offences reached its highest ever quarterly level between April and June 2021. Caution is needed when interpreting the level of police recorded sexual offences. Recent figures may reflect a number of factors including the impact of high-profile cases and campaigns on victims\u2019 willingness to report incidents. Police recorded crime data for the year ending June 2021 show:\nthe highest number of rape offences (61,158) recorded in a 12-month period, driven by the highest quarterly figure (17,285) between April and June 2021\nthe second highest number of sexual offences (164,763) recorded in a 12-month period, driven by the highest quarterly figure (48,553) between April and June 2021\n\n!\n\nCrime estimates for the year ending June 2021 best reflect the current extent of crime experienced by the population resident in households (Appendix Table A2). However, new telephone-based survey (TCSEW) estimates are not directly comparable with previous survey (CSEW) estimates because of changes to the sample and questionnaire (see Section 13). Percentages changes are presented using figures adjusted for these differences (Appendix Table A3).\n\n\n\nThe Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) began data collection on 20 May 2020 to capture trends in crime while normal face-to-face interviewing was suspended because of restrictions on social contact during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nAccording to TCSEW estimates, adults aged 18 years and over experienced 12.7 million offences in the year ending June 2021 (Appendix Table A2) including fraud and computer misuse. While there were decreases across a range of individual crime types, particularly theft offences, these were more than offset by rises in fraud and computer misuse offences (see Section 9), resulting in a 12% increase in overall levels of crime.\nTotal crime excluding fraud and computer misuse decreased by 14% compared with the year ending June 2019. This was largely driven by an 18% decrease in theft offences (Appendix Table A3). These decreases were related to the coronavirus pandemic and government instructions to limit social contact.\nFor the crime types and population it covers, the face-to-face Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a better indicator of long-term trends than police recorded crime. It is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police or police recording practices. Our comparability report has shown that TCSEW estimates can be directly compared with these long-term CSEW estimates when certain adjustments are applied (Appendix Table A3).\nFurther information on these changes is available in the Measuring the data section. \nSince the mid-1990s, there have been long-term falls in overall CSEW crime estimates (Figure 1). Long-term trends vary by crime types. For all headline figures, including a data time series, see Appendix tables.\nThe latest estimates show that 8 in 10 adults did not experience any of the crimes asked about in the TSCEW in the year ending June 2021 (Figure 2).\nThe TCSEW also showed that the likelihood of being a victim of crime varied by demographic characteristics. For more information, see the annual trend and demographic tables.\n\n!\n\nImprovements to recording processes and practices by the police, expansions of the recorded crime collection to include new offences, variations in police activity, more victims reporting crime, and genuine increases in some types of crime, have each made substantial contributions to rises in recorded crime over the last five years. This effect has been more pronounced for some crime types. For some types of offence these figures do not provide reliable trends in crime.\n\n\n\nTotal police recorded crime remained stable with 5.8 million crimes in England and Wales in the year ending June 2021, however there was a 3% decrease (4.9 million offences) when excluding fraud and computer misuse. Police recorded crime has fluctuated across the year ending June 2021 and hides a lot of variation by crime type. Most of the fluctuations can be attributed to the introduction and subsequent easing of national lockdown restrictions throughout the year alongside more normal seasonal variations for some crime types. \nFollowing the spring 2020 lockdown, total police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) remained lower from July 2020 to February 2021 compared with July 2019 to February 2020. The largest falls were seen in January 2021 compared with January 2020 (24% decrease), and February 2021 compared with February 2020 (21% decrease). These coincided with the reintroduction of more extensive national lockdown restrictions (Figure 3). \nFrom March 2021, monthly police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) was higher compared with 2020. April 2021 was 30% higher than April 2020 reflecting the impact of the first spring 2020 national lockdown. The June 2021 monthly figure was 18% higher than June 2020 and 2% higher than June 2019. This is the first monthly police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) figure higher than its respective month in 2019 since February 2020.\nTotal police recorded crime including fraud and computer misuse followed a similar but less pronounced pattern to crime, which excludes these offences. Offences recorded by Action Fraud or referred to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) were 20% higher in the year ending June 2021 compared with the year ending June 2020. \n\n\nFigure 3: Police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) fluctuated with changes in national lockdown restrictions\nEngland and Wales, monthly figures (July 2018 to June 2019, July 2019 to June 2020, and July 2020 to June 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nPolice recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 3: Police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) fluctuated with changes in national lockdown restrictions\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nCrime survey and police recorded crime data can be used together to develop a more complete picture of crime (Table 1).\nInformation on case outcomes can be found in Home Office Crime outcomes in England and Wales.\u2003\nThe police recorded 627 homicide offences in the year ending June 2021, an 11% decrease from the previous year (701 offences). The year ending June 2020 included the Grays lorry incident which involved the death of 39 migrants. Excluding this incident from the previous year\u2019s homicide count, the number of homicides showed a 5% decrease (from 662 to 627 offences) in the year ending June 2021. \n\n\nFigure 4: Homicide decreased by 11% in latest year (5% decrease excluding Grays lorry incident) \nEngland and Wales, year ending March 2003 to year ending June 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nThe dates shown for the London terrorist attacks in 2005 and 2017, and the Manchester arena bombing in 2017, correspond to when the events occurred, rather than when the homicides were recorded by the police.\nData on homicide offences given in these police recorded crime data will differ from data from the Home Office Homicide Index.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 4: Homicide decreased by 11% in latest year (5% decrease excluding Grays lorry incident) \nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThe rate of homicide in England and Wales remained at 10 per 1 million people in the year ending June 2021. \nThe number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased slightly from 269 to 262 offences in the year ending June 2021. Of all recorded homicides in the latest year, the method of killing was by knife or sharp instrument in 42% of offences, an increase from 39% in the previous year.\nFor the latest headline figures relating to homicide and more detailed figures including data time series, see Appendix tables and Other related tables. For Police Force Area breakdowns see Police Force Area data tables.\nPolice recorded crime provides a better measure than the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) of higher-harm but less common types of violence, such as those involving a knife or sharp instrument (knife-enabled crime).\n\n!\n\nFigures referenced in this section are not directly comparable with those previously published because of a change in knife or sharp instrument data collection practices.\n\n\n\nThere was an 8% decrease in knife-enabled crime recorded by the police in the year ending June 2021 (46,937 offences) compared with the previous year. This was driven by a 22% decrease in robbery offences to 16,850. The largest decreases in total knife-enabled crime were seen in October to December 2020 and January to March 2021 with offences down by 15% and 21% compared with respective periods in the previous years. Both these periods coincided with national lockdowns and the highest levels of restrictions on social contact. \n\n\nFigure 5: Knife-enabled crime decreased in the latest year driven by decrease in robbery offences \nEngland and Wales (excluding Greater Manchester Police), year ending March 2011 to year ending June 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nGreater Manchester Police reviewed their recording of offences involving knives or sharp instruments in December 2017 which revealed that they were under-counting these offences. Previous data were not revised at the time and therefore data from Greater Manchester Police are excluded to allow for comparison over time.\nAn adjustment has been made to data prior to the year ending March 2020 for police forces who are now using the NDQIS tool and the total for England and Wales. For more information on the adjustment to the time series and the differences in data collection methods, please see the methodology note \u2018Police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments: methodology changes\u2019.\nOther selected offences include rape, attempted murder, homicide, and sexual assault.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 5: Knife-enabled crime decreased in the latest year driven by decrease in robbery offences \nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nKnife or sharp instrument offences are concentrated in urban areas1. Decreases in the year ending June 2021 were observed in the Metropolitan Police (21% decrease) and the West Midlands (3% decrease), two of three Police Force Areas with the highest volume of knife-enabled crime. However, Greater Manchester saw a 4% increase in knife or sharp instrument offences.\nPolice recorded \u201cpossession of article with a blade or point\u201d2 offences increased by 2% to 22,096 in the year June 2021. This could have been influenced by increases in targeted police action. \nThe Home Office and police forces have continued to roll out a new methodology for identifying recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime). Twenty-seven forces have now switched to the NDQIS data collection methodology3. It is aimed that the new methodology will be rolled out to all forces in England and Wales over the next year. Estimates in this release include a combination of both new and old data collection methods. \nFor more information, including the differences in data collection methods, please see the methodology note Police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments, methodology changes and blog. \nThe latest available provisional admissions data for NHS hospitals in England and Wales reported a 4% decrease in admissions for assault by a sharp object in the year ending June 2021 (to 4,280 admissions).\nFor data relating to knife-enabled crime see Other related tables, for geographic breakdowns see Police Force Area data tables and for sharp instrument homicides see Appendix tables: homicide in England and Wales. Data related to stop and searches can be found in the Home Office publication Police powers and procedures.\nPolice recorded offences involving firearms decreased by 6% to 5,867 offences in the year ending June 2021 compared with 6,231 offences in the previous year. This decrease can be largely attributed to national lockdown restrictions that occurred throughout the year. Offences involving firearms were at their lowest level since the year ending March 2016. \n\n\nFigure 6: Crimes involving firearms show a 6% decrease compared with the previous year\nEngland and Wales year ending March 2003 to year ending June 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nMore explicit guidelines for the classification of weapons introduced on 1 April 2004 may have increased the recording of firearm offences, particularly those committed by imitation weapons.\nFirearms data are provisional. Excludes offences involving the use of conventional air weapons, such as air rifles and offences recorded by British Transport Police. Includes crimes recorded by police where a firearm has been fired, used as a blunt instrument against a person or used as a threat.\nMost police forces have made data quality and recording improvements which means data from earlier years are not directly comparable with recent years. Some forces have also revised data, which means data may not match earlier publications.\nImitation firearms include replica weapons, as well as low-powered weapons which fire small plastic pellets, such as BB guns and soft air weapons.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 6: Crimes involving firearms show a 6% decrease compared with the previous year\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nFor data relating to offences involving weapons see Offences involving the use of weapons: data tables. For data relating to offences involving firearms see Other related tables.\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides the best picture of the overall trend in violent crime.\nEstimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 1.9 million violent offences in the year ending June 2021 (Appendix Table A2). Using a comparable dataset adjusted for changes in the sample and questionnaire between the CSEW and TCSEW (see Appendix Table A3), there was no significant change in total violent incidents compared with the year ending June 2019. \nAlthough the TCSEW indicated no change in the total number of violence incidents, there was a 27% decrease in the number of victims compared with the year ending June 2019. (Appendix Table A3). This was largely driven by falls in the prevalence of violence where the offender was a stranger. This likely reflects a decrease in violence taking place in public spaces during national lockdown restrictions. However, there has been a large but non-significant increase in acquaintance violence1. These estimates of violence are not indicative of levels of domestic abuse during the pandemic since the TCSEW was not able to produce such estimates. \nPolice recorded crime data showed a 4% decrease in violence with injury to 494,136 offences. Violence without injury offences remained stable at 716,521 in the year ending June 2021 compared with the year ending June 2020 (714,131). \nFor more detailed figures relating to violent crime, including a data time series, see Appendix tables.\n\n!\n\nDomestic abuse-related crimes and sexual offences recorded by the police do not provide a reliable measure of trends in these types of crime. Improvements in police recording practices and increased reporting by victims have contributed to increases in recent years. The figures do, however, provide a good measure of the crime-related demand on the police.\n\n\n\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides a more reliable measure of long-term trends in domestic abuse, sexual assault, stalking and harassment. Questions related to these offences had to be suspended with the move to telephone interviewing from May 2020.\nThe police recorded 846,235 offences (excluding fraud) flagged as domestic abuse-related in the year ending June 2021. This represents a 6% increase from 813,958 offences in the previous year. This included 687,328 violence against the person offences flagged as domestic abuse-related, a 7% increase compared with the year ending June 2020. \nIt is difficult to determine the levels of domestic abuse in England and Wales using police recorded data because of gradual increases in recent years following changes in recording practices and high levels of non-reporting. In addition, we were unable to draw upon analysis from the crime survey; we cannot collect survey data on domestic abuse because of concerns around confidentiality and respondent safeguarding, which limit the types of questions asked via the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales.\nGiven this, we cannot conclude whether there has been an increase in the number of victims of domestic abuse. However, data from victim services suggests that experiences of domestic abuse may have intensified during periods of national lockdown and that victims faced difficulties in safely seeking support under these conditions.\nFurther information and data related to domestic abuse can be found in Domestic abuse in England and Wales overview: November 2020. This publication will be updated later this month (November 2021).\nAs a result of the need to move to telephone interviewing for the crime survey during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, for safeguarding and ethical reasons it has not been possible to include detailed questions relating to sexual offences. In the absence of survey data, police recorded data needs to be treated with caution. Prior to the pandemic, the number of police recorded sexual offences was well below the number of victims estimated by CSEW, with fewer than one in six victims of rape or assault by penetration reporting the crime to the police. There is, therefore, a great deal of scope for increases in police recorded crime.\nThe number of sexual offences recorded by the police showed an 8% increase in the year ending June 2021 (164,763 offences) compared with the previous year. The period April to June 2021 saw the highest ever recorded quarterly figure (48,553 offences), 15% higher than the April to June 2019 quarter, which was the previous highest (see Figure 8).\nRape accounted for 37% of all sexual offences recorded by the police. The number of rape offences in the year ending June 2021 was the highest ever recorded annual figure to date (61,158 offences). This was driven by a large increase in the latest April to June 2021 quarter (17,285 offences), which saw a 19% rise compared with January to March 2021. The latest quarterly rape figure was particularly high compared with the range of 11,836 to 15,557 offences per quarter in the last three years.\n\n\nFigure 8: April to June 2021 had the highest quarterly police-recorded sexual and rape offences to date\nEngland and Wales quarterly data from April 2009 to June 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nOperation Yewtree is the police investigation into allegations of sexual abuse, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 8: April to June 2021 had the highest quarterly police-recorded sexual and rape offences to date\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThe latest quarterly figure may reflect the impact of recent high-profile events, media coverage and campaigns on people\u2019s willingness to report incidents to the police, as well as a potential increase in the number of victims. The overall trend is also currently difficult to disentangle from the impact of lockdowns. While offences recorded by the police dropped noticeably during the spring 2020 lockdown before rebounding in the July to September 2020 quarter, this was not so noticeable during the winter 2020 to 2021 lockdowns.\nFurther data related to sexual offences can be found in the Sexual offences in England and Wales overview: year ending March 2020 publication.\nCSEW data on the prevalence of domestic abuse, sexual assault and stalking for the year ending March 2020 can be found in Table S42 in Annual supplementary tables.\nFor information about Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) inspections of police recorded crime and incident data quality see our User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales: Measuring crime during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is the most reliable indicator for long-term trends in the more common types of crime experienced by the general population, such as theft. However, police recorded crime data can give reliable indications of trends in some offences involving theft (for example, domestic burglary) and may provide a better measure of short-term trends. \nThere were 3 million incidents of theft estimated by the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) for the year ending June 2021 (Appendix Table A2). This was an 18% decrease compared with the year ending June 2019 (Appendix Table A3). This large fall was seen across most sub-categories with the largest fall of 50% seen in the \u201ctheft from a person\u201d offence, followed by a 31% decrease in domestic burglary offences and a 23% reduction in vehicle-related theft offences.\nA similar pattern was seen in police recorded theft offences, which decreased by 21% in the year ending June 2021 compared with the previous year, from 1.7 million to 1.4 million offences. This was driven by decreases in offences such as: theft from the person (36%), burglary (24%), shoplifting (21%) and vehicle offences (19%). \nPolice recorded robbery offences decreased by 21% in the year ending June 2021 compared with the previous year, from 79,659 to 62,803 offences. \nAll these falls were likely to be driven by national lockdown restrictions, with non-essential shops and the night-time economy being closed and people spending more time in their homes.\nFor the latest headline figures relating to theft and for more detailed figures, including time series, see Appendix tables.\nEstimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 5 million fraud offences in the year ending June 2021, a 32% increase compared with the year ending June 2019 (Appendix Table A3). This included large increases in \u201cconsumer and retail fraud\u201d, \u201cadvance fee fraud\u201d and \u201cother fraud\u201d and may indicate fraudsters taking advantage of behaviour changes related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, such as increased online shopping and increased savings. For example, advance fee fraud offences included scams where victims transferred funds to fraudsters for postal deliveries; other fraud included investment opportunity scams. A minority (26%) of these offences resulted in loss of money or property, with no or only partial reimbursement.\nFraud offences reported to the police are recorded and collected by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) from Action Fraud and two industry bodies, Cifas and UK Finance. Action Fraud (the public-facing national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre) reported a 36% rise in fraud offences (to 424,397 offences) compared with the year ending June 2020. The data showed a 34% increase in \u201conline shopping and auctions\u201d fraud in the latest year (from 70,761 to 94,795 offences) and a 51% increase in \u201cfinancial investment fraud\u201d (from 14,685 to 22,200 offences).\nNFIB data showed referrals from Cifas (who report instances of fraud where their member organisations have been victims) decreased by 1% (to 312,895 offences) compared with the year ending June 2020. However, UK Finance reported a 43% increase (to 153,515 offences)1.\nMany cases recorded separately by UK Finance (via a fraud reporting database called CAMIS) are not reported to the NFIB because they hold insufficient information to be of value from an intelligence perspective. UK Finance reported a 10% increase in fraud incidents (to 3.2 million incidents) in CAMIS. This was driven by a 15% increase in remote purchase fraud (to 2.5 million incidents). There was also a 71% increase in remote banking fraud (to 94,180 incidents), which reflects the greater number of people now regularly using internet, telephone and mobile banking, and the attempts by fraudsters to take advantage of this.\nFor the latest headline figures relating to fraud and for more detailed figures, including a data time series, see Appendix tables, Other related tables and Police Force Area tables. \nEstimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 1.8 million computer misuse offences in the year ending June 2021. This was an 85% increase compared with the year ending June 2019, largely driven by a 161% increase in \u201cUnauthorised access to personal information (including hacking)\u201d offences (Appendix Table A3). This included victims\u2019 details being compromised via large-scale data breaches, and victims\u2019 email or social media accounts being compromised. Our most recent Nature of fraud and computer misuse in England and Wales: year ending March 2019 publication reported that 68% of victims were not affected at all by the incident.\nThe National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) also reported a 31% increase in \u201cHacking \u2013 personal\u201d offences referred by Action Fraud (from 4,065 to 5,336 offences). See Appendix Table A5. \nThe TCSEW provides a better indication of the volume of computer misuse offences experienced by the adult population as it captures incidents that go unreported to the police. This can be seen by the large difference in the volume of computer misuse offences between the two sources, which also cannot be compared because of differences in coverage.\nFor the latest headline figures relating to computer misuse and for more detailed figures see Appendix tables and Other related tables.\nThe Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TSCEW) showed that 28% of adults personally witnessed or experienced anti-social behaviour in their area in the last 12 months. \nEstimates from the TCSEW showed that 49% of adults noticed individuals breaching virus restrictions in their local area since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began. Of these, 7% reported the breach to the police.\nTCSEW estimates also showed that 8% of adults experienced being insulted, called names, threatened or shouted at in public spaces in the year ending June 2021. Where a specific perceived reason for the harassment was given, the most common was because of the coronavirus pandemic (19%). This included experiences related to social distancing and lockdown restrictions.\nThe most common non-coronavirus-related perceived reason for these experiences was their race or ethnicity (10%), followed by education, income level or job (9%). \nThe police recorded 1.8 million incidents of anti-social behaviour (ASB) in the year ending June 2021. Following consistent decreases over the past 10 years, this was an increase of 7% (excluding British Transport Police) compared with the year ending June 2020. The largest increase was seen in January to March 2021, with incidents up 46% compared with January to March 2020. This increase may reflect the reporting of breaches to public health restrictions, as most police forces include breaches reported to them by members of the public as an ASB incident. \n\nCrime in England and Wales: Appendix tables  Dataset | Released on 4 November 2021  Long-term trends in Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) crime, estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) and police recorded crime, by offence type.Crime in England and Wales: Coronavirus and crime tables  Dataset | Released on 4 November 2021  Information from a new module of questions included in the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) around perceptions of crime, the police and anti-social behaviour during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and feelings of safety and experiences of harassment.

Excluding fraud and computer misuse showed a 14% decrease in total crime, mostly driven by an 18% decrease in theft offences.\nThis was a period when England and Wales were placed under restrictions to thwart the spread of COVID-19.\nThere was also a 27% decrease in the number of victims of violent crime, largely driven by falls in violence where the offender was a stranger. This in part reflects the closure of night-time economy for several months of the year.\nFraud and computer misuse offences bucked the trend, in that they increased during this period. There was a 32% increase in fraud incidents, largely driven by substantial increases in both \u2018consumer and retail fraud\u2019 and \u2018advance fee fraud\u2019.\nThis may indicate fraudsters taking advantage of behaviour changes related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, such as increased online shopping and increased savings.\nThere was also an 85% increase in computer misuse incidents, driven entirely by a 161% increase in \u2018unauthorised access to personal information, including hacking\u2019 offences.\n", "id": 115}, {"document": "In England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased in the week ending 6 November 2021; we estimate that 925,400 people in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 875,200 to 975,100), equating to around 1 in 60 people.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased in the week ending 6 November 2021; we estimate that 64,900 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 52,700 to 78,200), equating to around 1 in 45 people.\nIn Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was uncertain in the week ending 6 November 2021; we estimate that 24,700 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 18,000 to 32,400) equating to around 1 in 75 people.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) remained level in the week ending 6 November 2021; we estimate that 62,100 people in Scotland had COVID-19, (95% credible interval: 50,000 to 74,500) equating to around 1 in 85 people.\nWithin this bulletin, we summarise some of the latest results from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey.

You can also find out more about\u00a0comparing methods used in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace\u00a0in our article, to better understand comparisons in data sources.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the population living in private residential households. We exclude those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. In communal establishments, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nOur estimates are based on confirmed positive test results. The remaining swabs are either negative, which are included in our analysis, or are inconclusive. Some swabs are test failures, which are not included in our analysis. We are working with the laboratories to understand consistency in the identification of inconclusive results, that could be weak positive results. The impact of this on our estimates of positive infections is likely to be very small and unlikely to affect the trend.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases among the population living in private households, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other communal establishments\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 6 November 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) has decreased in England and Wales, and has remained level in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain in the week ending 6 November 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wider and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across regions in England. In the week ending 6 November 2021, there were early signs of an increase in the percentage of people testing positive in the East Midlands. In the same week, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain in the West Midlands. In all other regions, the percentage decreased in the week ending 6 November 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 also varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 31 October to 6 November 2021.\n.XLSX\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"aged two years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to those aged 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased for those aged two years to school Year 6, school Year 7 to school Year 11, those aged 25 to 34 years, those aged 50 to 69 years, and those aged 70 years and over in the week ending 6 November 2021. The percentage of people testing positive decreased for those aged 35 to 49 years in the two weeks up to 6 November 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the week up to 6 November 2021. The trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain for those in school Year 12 to those aged 24 years in the week ending 6 November 2021.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 remained highest for those in school Years 7 to 11, at 4.76% (95% credible interval: 4.14% to 5.44%) in the week ending 6 November 2021.\n.XLSX\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries, 26 September to 6 November 2021. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. These estimates are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggests the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 in England has decreased in children and younger adults. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison with England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider\u00a0confidence intervals. In Wales, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain across all ages, but there were possible signs of a decrease in those at secondary school age. In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage testing positive was uncertain across all ages. In Scotland, the percentage testing positive has decreased for those at secondary school age and young adults in recent weeks. The trend was uncertain for children and older adults in Scotland.\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\n.XLSX\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 23 October 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases continued to increase in Northern Ireland, but the trends were uncertain in England, Wales and Scotland.\u00a0Credible intervals\u00a0are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish\u00a0Cycle-threshold (Ct) values, which indicate viral load and act as a proxy for the strength of the virus. We also break down infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests.\nThe\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance. You can find out more in the\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England briefing document (PDF, 2.51MB).\nUK Variants of Concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nInfections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common since the end of May 2021 in England, and since the end of July 2021 in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections where we were able to obtain a genetic sequence were the Delta variant or a genetic descendant/sub-lineage of the Delta variant. These all have the same gene positivity pattern. Because of this high proportion with the same gene positivity pattern, we have not included a breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab test. We last published our main variant analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where you can find more details. Our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nOur\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog\u00a0and in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low -- under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 12 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 12 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 12 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 12 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 12 November 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency (UK HSA) and Wellcome Trust.

These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across regions in England. In the week ending 13 November 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, West Midlands and South West. In the two weeks up to 13 November 2021, the percentage testing positive increased in the East Midlands and decreased in the North East, London, South East and East of England. However, for all of these regions the trend was uncertain in the most recent week ending 13 November 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 also varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 7 to 13 November 2021.\n.XLSX\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"aged two years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to those aged 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased for those in school Year 7 to school Year 11, school Year 12 to those aged 24 years, those aged 35 to 49 years, and those aged 70 years and over in the week ending 13 November 2021. The percentage of people testing positive decreased for those aged two years to school Year 6 in the two weeks up to 13 November 2021, however, the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. The trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain for those aged 25 to 34 years and those aged 50 to 69 years in the week ending 13 November 2021.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 remained highest for those in school Years 7 to school Year 11, at 3.63% (95% credible interval: 3.11% to 4.20%) in the week ending 13 November 2021.\nNotes:\n.XLSX\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries, 3 October to 13 November 2021. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. These estimates are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggests the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 in England has decreased in children and younger adults, and remained level among older ages. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison with England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider\u00a0confidence intervals. In Wales, there were signs of a decrease for those of secondary school age and those aged around 40 years, but the trend was uncertain for all other ages. In Scotland, there were signs of a decrease for those of secondary school age and young adults, but the trend was uncertain for all other ages. In Northern Ireland, the percentage testing positive in secondary school ages appeared to increase, but the trend was uncertain for all other age groups.\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\n.XLSX\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 30 October 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases decreased in England and Wales and the trends were uncertain in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\u00a0Credible intervals\u00a0are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish\u00a0Cycle-threshold (Ct) values, which indicate viral load and act as a proxy for the strength of the virus. We also break down infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests.\nThe\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance. You can find out more in the\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England briefing document (PDF, 2.51MB).\nUK Variants of Concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nInfections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common since the end of May 2021 in England, and since the end of July 2021 in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections, from which we obtained a genetic sequence, were genetically compatible with the Delta variant or its descendants. Because these all have the same gene positivity pattern on our swab test, we have not included a breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns. We last published our main variant analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where you can find more details. Our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nOur\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog\u00a0and in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency (UK HSA) and Wellcome Trust.

An estimated 824,900 people would have tested positive in England, and around 55,800 people in Wales.\nThe percentage of people testing positive remained level in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the trend was uncertain in the most recent week.\nThe estimated percentage of people living in private households (not in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments) that had COVID-19 in the most recent week was: - 1.51% in England (1 in 65 people), compared with 1.70% (1 in 60 people) the week before - 1.84% in Wales (1 in 55 people), compared with 2.13% (1 in 45 people) the week before - 1.53% in Northern Ireland (1 in 65 people), compared with 1.35% (1 in 75 people) the week before - 1.06% in Scotland (1 in 95 people), compared with 1.18% (1 in 85 people) the week before\nIn England, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in children and younger adults and remained level among older age groups. In Wales and Scotland, there were signs of a decrease in infections among those of secondary school age. In Northern Ireland, the positivity rate in secondary school ages appeared to increase.\n", "id": 124}, {"document": "The UK has seen a gradual but sustained increase in relative excess mortality since spring 2021, after an initial drop from the very high excess mortality in winter 2020 to 21.\nFor much of the first half of 2021, relative excess mortality in the UK was higher for younger people (aged 0 to 64 years) than for older people; this differed from most countries except Slovakia, Hungary and Czechia. \nIn 2021 countries in central Europe such as Poland, Bulgaria and Czechia increasingly overtook western Europe (including the UK) to have the highest relative cumulative excess mortality since the start of the pandemic by mid-2021, while the UK was similar to Spain and Portugal.\nThe Nordic countries, with the exception of Sweden, have consistently had lower than average levels of cumulative excess mortality since the start of 2020, despite the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n!\n\nThis article looks at all-cause mortality as a comparable international indicator of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and does not specifically analyse deaths due to COVID-19.\n\n\n\nThe best way of comparing the mortality impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic internationally is by looking at all-cause mortality compared with the five-year average. All-cause mortality avoids the problem of different countries recording COVID-19 deaths in different ways, and also takes into account the indirect impact of the coronavirus pandemic, such as deaths from other causes that might be related to delayed access to healthcare.\nWe have sourced our European mortality and population data from databases published by Eurostat. There are strict criteria that data must meet to be included, so analysing data from this source provides an opportunity to be as comparable as possible. This means we are reliant on the availability of data submitted to Eurostat by participating countries. More information about the data used in this article can be found in the accompanying methods paper.\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) show the number of deaths observed per 100,000 people, taking into account differences in population age-structure between places and over time.\nRelative age-standardised mortality rates (rASMRs) are measures of excess mortality. They are expressed as the percentage difference per week in 2020 or 2021 from the average expected ASMR in 2015 to 2019. See the accompanying methods paper for details of how these are calculated.\nA negative value indicates a weekly 2020 or 2021 ASMR below what is expected, given the 2015 to 2019 five-year average for that week. In contrast, a positive value indicates a weekly ASMR above the five-year average.\nFigure 1 shows relative age-standardised mortality rates (rASMRs) for the UK, constituent countries of the UK and 11 European countries with the highest peak in excess mortality (rASMRs) in the first half of 2021.\nIn 2020, Portugal had one of the lowest peak excess mortality levels of all European countries (30.7% higher than the five-year average in week ending 17 July), but it then had the highest peak excess mortality in early 2021 (83.0% in week ending 22 January).\nRelative age-standardised mortality rates, all ages, weeks ending 3 January 2020 to 18 June 2021, 16 selected European countries\nSpikes in excess mortality are generally characterised by higher peaks for all ages than for those aged 0 to 64 years. This is because COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in older age groups (those aged 65 years and over). However, this trend has become less clear for some countries in the first half of 2021, most noticeably for the UK nations, Czechia and Hungary. Compared with all ages, those aged up to 64 years in these countries saw worse mortality rates (higher rASMRs) relative to the average in some or all weeks. This suggests that COVID-19 disproportionately impacted mortality rates for younger compared with older age groups in these countries in the first half of 2021. Data by age bands can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nNone of the 16 European countries with the highest peak excess mortality in the first half of 2021 were Nordic (a sub-region of Northern Europe comprising of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden). Figure 2 shows that the Nordic countries had relatively low peak excess mortality in both 2020 and in the first half of 2021, compared with most other countries.\nAlmost all countries had lower peak excess mortality in the first half of 2021 compared with 2020, except for Portugal (83.0% and 30.7%), Estonia (23.2% and 9.5%), and Hungary (65.5% and 59.0%). Spain had the highest peak excess mortality of all countries in 2020, and below average peak excess mortality in the first half of 2021, dropping from 141.2% to 21.1%.\nFigure 3 shows a map of rASMRs at local authority level where data are available, using nomenclature of territorial units for statistics level 3 (NUTS3), a regional level of geography usually constituting one or two local government areas or municipalities.\nThe map depicts the spread of the coronavirus pandemic across Europe from spring 2020, starting in Lodi in northern Italy, through the relative low excess mortality for most countries during the summer months of 2020, followed by high levels of excess mortality in central Europe during winter 2020. During January to March 2021 there were again high levels of excess mortality as the winter and increased cases of COVID-19 took hold across much of Europe, with Portugal, countries in central Europe and the UK among the worst affected. Countries with high excess mortality in the second half of 2020 also tended to have high excess mortality in the first half of 2021, either as a continuation of a spike in excess mortality spanning both 2020 and 2021 (in Slovakia and the UK) or in two distinct spikes (in Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland)\nInteractive map, weeks ending 3 January 2020 to 3 September 2021\nAt the regional level, rASMRs had much larger variation than at national level because of smaller numbers of deaths involved, as well as specific areas within each country being more affected than others.\nExcess mortality in the UK in 2021 peaked in January, before dropping to negative values (lower mortality compared with the five-year average) for all UK countries by the week ending 5 March 2021. Since then, excess mortality has steadily increased for all UK countries, and by the week ending 3 September 2021 ranged from -4.3% for England to 20.8% for Northern Ireland.\nAs seen in Figure 4, weekly rASMRs for the UK nations fluctuated considerably from week to week, and the UK nation with the highest excess mortality rate varied over time.\nRelative age-standardised mortality rates, all ages, weeks ending 3 January 2020 to 3 September 2021, UK countries\nAll 20 UK NUTS3 areas with the highest peak excess mortality levels in 2021 (up until 3 September 2021) are located in London, the South East, and the East of England, with the exception of Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot in South Wales (Table 1). The peak rates for these areas all occurred in January or in the first week of February 2021.\nThe next section uses relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates (rcASMRs) to measure cumulative excess mortality relative to the 2015 to 2019 average mortality rates. Measures of cumulative mortality evaluate the total extent of mortality from one time point to another, relative to the average for an equivalent period in the past. The week ending 3 January 2020 is used as the start point in this article.\nThe rcASMRs we present for 2020 and 2021 show whether age-standardised mortality since the week ending 3 January 2020 has been above or below average up to that point. The rcASMR expresses this difference as a percentage relative to the average for an equivalent period in 2015 to 2019. A zero value for rcASMR indicates that age-standardised mortality for the period to date has been equal to the average. A positive value indicates worse than average mortality, and a negative value indicates better than average mortality. The rcASMR can increase or decrease over time.\nBy using an age-standardised rate-based measure of cumulative excess mortality, we are accounting for differences in both the age structures and seasonal mortality patterns of countries analysed. See the accompanying methods paper for further details of how rcASMRs are calculated.\nFigure 5 shows the trend in rcASMR from the start of 2020 to week ending 18 June 2021 (the most recent week available at the time of analysis with data available for all countries) for the UK, constituent countries of the UK and11 countries with the highest rcASMRs by this point.\nRelative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates, persons, all ages and age 0 to 64 years, weeks ending 3 January 2020 to 18 June 2021, 16 selected European countries.\nBy the week ending 18 June 2021, Poland had the highest rcASMR at 23.0% followed by Bulgaria at 20.8% and Czechia at 20.4%. All these countries had a negative rcASMR for the corresponding week in 2020 (ending 12 June), indicating that the rise in the rcASMR in these central European countries was driven entirely by excess mortality between mid-2020 and mid-2021. In contrast, following surges in mortality in the spring, many western European countries already had positive cumulative excess mortality by mid-2020, the highest being England (7.2%), the UK (6.7%), Spain (6.5%), Scotland (5.1%), and Wales (4.1%).\nNegative rcASMRs indicate an overall improvement in mortality over time, while positive values indicate a worsening level of mortality. We recorded eight countries with negative rcASMR values by week ending 18 June 2021: Denmark, Cyprus, Finland, Iceland, Malta, Norway, Luxembourg, and Sweden. Norway had the lowest rcASMR, at -12.1%. These countries saw overall mortality rate improvement throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021 compared with the previous five years despite the coronavirus pandemic (see Figure 6 and Table 2).\nRelative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates, persons, all ages, weeks ending 3 January 2020 to week ending 3 September 2021, European countries.\nFor ages up to 64 years, Bulgaria had the highest rcASMR in the week ending 18 June 2021 by quite some way, at 24.6%, followed by England at 15.7%, the UK at 14.8%, and Romania at 14.5%. This means that England, and the UK as a whole, had higher excess mortality in the younger age groups than most other European countries.\nIn addition, several countries including Bulgaria, Romania, and (from late 2020/early 2021) all UK nations apart from Wales were unusual in having higher cumulative excess mortality for those aged up to 64 years than for those aged 65 years and over. This suggests that in relative terms, excess mortality of younger age groups in these countries has been adversely affected to a greater extent than for older age groups since the start of 2020, although the great majority of deaths were in the older age group.\nFor those aged 65 years and over, Poland had the highest rcASMR by 18 June 2021 (week 24) at 26.0%, followed by Czechia with 21.5% and Bulgaria with 19.9%.\nIn 2021, rcASMRs increased again for many countries, as combined winter pressures on health systems and increased numbers of COVID-19 infections led to higher-than-average levels of mortality. This increase was most evident for Poland, Bulgaria, Czechia, and Slovakia, all of which saw rcASMR increases in excess of 10% between the end of 2020 and mid-2021.\nWe use weekly all-cause death registration data published by Eurostat from contributing nations of the European Union and European Free Trade Association. There are clear criteria set out by Eurostat for data to be submitted to their database, based on official recording of deaths occurring in all settings, to maximise comparability.\nFor the UK we use Office for National Statistics (ONS) data for England and Wales, National Records Scotland (NRS) data for Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) data for Northern Ireland.\nAnalysis of all-cause mortality allows us to examine the impact of the pandemic not only from deaths due to COVID-19 but also excess deaths that have occurred as a result of the wider impacts of the virus on healthcare systems and society. Given the widely differing practices in recording and reporting deaths relating to COVID-19 it is not possible at this time to conduct accurate international comparisons of deaths involving COVID-19 specifically.\nMore information can be fount in the accompanying methods paper.\n", "summary": "UK excess mortality in 2021 peaked in January, but has steadily increased since the Spring\nAlmost all European countries (including the UK) had lower peak excess mortality in the first half of 2021 compared with 2020, except for Portugal, Estonia, and Hungary.\nExcess mortality in the UK in 2021 peaked in January, before dropping to negative values (lower mortality compared to the five-year average) for all UK countries by the week ending 5 March 2021.\nSince then, excess mortality has steadily increased for all UK countries, and by the week ending 3 September 2021 ranged from -4.3% for England to 20.8% for Northern Ireland.\nThe chart shows provisional relative age-standardised mortality rates (rASMRs) for the UK, constituent countries of the UK and 11 European countries with the highest peak in excess mortality (rASMRs) in the first half of 2021.\nCompared to 2020, throughout much of 2021, relative excess mortality in the UK, Czechia and Hungary was higher for younger (0 to 64 years) than for older (65 years and over).\nDuring the pandemic, spikes in excess mortality have been generally characterised by higher peaks for all ages than for age 0 to 64 years. This is because COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in older age groups. However, this trend has become less clear for some countries in the first half of 2021, most noticeably for the UK nations, Czechia and Hungary.\nCompared to all ages, those aged up to 64 in these countries saw worse mortality rates relative to the average in some or all weeks. This suggests that COVID-19 disproportionately impacted mortality rates for younger compared to older age groups in these countries in the first half of 2021.\nMost Nordic countries have had relatively low peak excess mortality in both 2020 and in the first half of 2021, compared to most other countries.\n", "id": 126}, {"document": "In England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to decrease in the week ending 13 November 2021; we estimate that 824,900 people in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 775,500 to 873,700), equating to around 1 in 65 people.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 continued to decrease in the week ending 13 November 2021; we estimate that 55,800 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 44,800 to 68,100), equating to around 1 in 55 people.\nIn Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 was uncertain in the week ending 13 November 2021; we estimate that 28,100 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 21,300 to 35,900), equating to around 1 in 65 people.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 remained level in the week ending 13 November 2021; we estimate that 56,000 people in Scotland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 45,500 to 68,100) equating to around 1 in 95 people.\nWithin this bulletin, we summarise some of the latest results from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey.

More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nOur estimates are based on confirmed positive test results. The remaining swabs are either negative, which are included in our analysis, or are inconclusive, which are not included in our analysis. Some swabs are test failures, which are also not included in our analysis. We are working with the laboratories to understand consistency in the identification of inconclusive results, that could be weak positive results. The impact of this on our estimates of positive infections is likely to be very small and unlikely to affect the trend.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of positive cases among the population living in private households, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between UK countries and different regions in England\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other communal establishments\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 13 November 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to decrease in England and Wales and remained level in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the trend for the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain in the week ending 13 November 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wider and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across regions in England. In the week ending 13 November 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, West Midlands and South West. In the two weeks up to 13 November 2021, the percentage testing positive increased in the East Midlands and decreased in the North East, London, South East and East of England. However, for all of these regions the trend was uncertain in the most recent week ending 13 November 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 also varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 7 to 13 November 2021.\n.XLSX\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"aged two years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to those aged 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased for those in school Year 7 to school Year 11, school Year 12 to those aged 24 years, those aged 35 to 49 years, and those aged 70 years and over in the week ending 13 November 2021. The percentage of people testing positive decreased for those aged two years to school Year 6 in the two weeks up to 13 November 2021, however, the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. The trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain for those aged 25 to 34 years and those aged 50 to 69 years in the week ending 13 November 2021.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 remained highest for those in school Years 7 to school Year 11, at 3.63% (95% credible interval: 3.11% to 4.20%) in the week ending 13 November 2021.\nNotes:\n.XLSX\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries, 3 October to 13 November 2021. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. These estimates are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggests the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 in England has decreased in children and younger adults, and remained level among older ages. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison with England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider\u00a0confidence intervals. In Wales, there were signs of a decrease for those of secondary school age and those aged around 40 years, but the trend was uncertain for all other ages. In Scotland, there were signs of a decrease for those of secondary school age and young adults, but the trend was uncertain for all other ages. In Northern Ireland, the percentage testing positive in secondary school ages appeared to increase, but the trend was uncertain for all other age groups.\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\n.XLSX\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 30 October 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases decreased in England and Wales and the trends were uncertain in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\u00a0Credible intervals\u00a0are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish\u00a0Cycle-threshold (Ct) values, which indicate viral load and act as a proxy for the strength of the virus. We also break down infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests.\nThe\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance. You can find out more in the\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England briefing document (PDF, 2.51MB).\nUK Variants of Concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nInfections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common since the end of May 2021 in England, and since the end of July 2021 in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections, from which we obtained a genetic sequence, were genetically compatible with the Delta variant or its descendants. Because these all have the same gene positivity pattern on our swab test, we have not included a breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns. We last published our main variant analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where you can find more details. Our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nOur\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog\u00a0and in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 19 November 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency (UK HSA) and Wellcome Trust.

We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 6 November 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases decreased in England, increased in Scotland and the trend was uncertain Northern Ireland. In Wales, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases decreased in the two weeks up to 6 November 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week.\u00a0Credible intervals\u00a0are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish\u00a0Cycle-threshold (Ct) values, which indicate viral load and act as a proxy for the strength of the virus. We also break down infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests.\nThe\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance. You can find out more in the\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England briefing document (PDF, 2.51MB).\nUK Variants of Concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK\nBeta: B.1.351, first identified in South Africa\nGamma: P.1, first identified in Brazil\nDelta: B.1.617.2, first identified in India\nInfections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common since the end of May 2021 in England, and since the end of July 2021 in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections, from which we obtained a genetic sequence, were genetically compatible with the Delta variant or its descendants. Because these all have the same gene positivity pattern on our swab test, we have not included a breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns. We last published our main variant analysis in\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where you can find more details. Our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nOur\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog\u00a0and in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low -- under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey.

This was 6.1 times higher than the 10,320 EWD observed in 2019 to 2020, the lowest in the data time series. \nThis increase was driven by the large number of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) in the non-winter months of 2020 and the winter months of 2021.

This is the case for all age groups.\nThe age-adjusted risk of deaths involving COVID-19 for people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated individuals varied from 99% lower (in February) to 78% lower (in October); this could be caused by various factors, such as changes in the composition of the group, changes in background COVID-19 infection rates, changing levels of immunity from prior infection, changing dominant variants, seasonal changes in mortality rates and vaccine waning.\nThe ASMRs calculated for specific months highlight changes over time, however they can become less meaningful if the population in a particular vaccination status group becomes very small, and less representative of the general population. Therefore we present the overall figure, which is less affected by composition effects, and the monthly figures over time, to show the changes over the year.\nOver the whole period (1 January to 31 October 2021), the age-adjusted risk of deaths involving COVID-19 was 96% lower in people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people.\nThe age-adjusted rates are not equivalent to measures of vaccine effectiveness; they account for differences in age structure and population size but there may be other differences between the groups, particularly underlying health, which affect the mortality rates.\nChanges in non-COVID-19 mortality by vaccination status are largely driven by the changing composition of the vaccination status groups because of the prioritisation of clinically extremely vulnerable and people with underlying health conditions, and differences in timing of vaccination among people who were eligible.\nComparing mortality across coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination status is challenging because the size and age structure of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations changes over time, because of vaccinations being offered according to priority groups set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). To account for these differences, we calculated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs). However, the vaccination roll-out was also prioritised by health status of individuals, with the extremely clinically vulnerable and those with underlying health conditions being vaccinated earlier than other people in their age group. In addition, frontline health and social care workers, who could have a higher occupational risk, were also prioritised for vaccination. These factors influence the ASMRs and are particularly apparent for the non-COVID-19 mortality rates. The ASMRs are also affected by changes over time such as in infection levels, different dominant variants, differing level of immunity from prior infection and seasonal mortality.\nASMRs are therefore not equivalent to measures of vaccine effectiveness, which are reported on the COVID-19 insights tool. The ASMRs give the age-adjusted risk of death for the people in the different vaccination status groups. Estimating vaccine effectiveness is challenging when vaccination status is not allocated at random, as factors that vary between the vaccination status groups and over time need to be accounted for to determine the causal impact of vaccines on mortality. Nonetheless, the ASMRs give a simple, fast measure of how mortality rates vary by vaccination status, and can indicate that vaccines are likely to be protective against COVID-19 mortality. But the impact of other factors on the rates and how these vary with time must be considered when interpreting the ASMRs. We will continue to provide updates and additional analysis of deaths by vaccination status as the situation evolves.\nThe rates in this release are calculated using the Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) dataset. This is a dataset containing people who reside in England who could be linked to the 2011 Census and the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for Pandemic Planning and Research (GDPPR). The data used in this analysis covers approximately 79% of people aged 10 years and over living in England. This means the unvaccinated population does not need to be estimated from an unknown total population, therefore rates are more accurate (see Measuring the data).\nThe vaccination status is split by dose and time since vaccination, to allow for the increase in protection in the first few weeks after vaccination. The vaccination status is one of:\nunvaccinated\nreceived only the first dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived only the first dose, at least 21 days ago\nreceived the second dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived the second dose, at least 21 days ago\nWe use the dates of death occurrences, rather than registrations, to calculate mortality rates by vaccination status, because the vaccination statuses of the living population can change notably between the dates that the deaths occurred and when they were registered. We do not take into account when someone was infected as this is not always possible to determine and is not possible when looking at all-cause or non-COVID-19 deaths.\nIn this publication and the accompanying reference tables we provide updated whole period ASMRs, to provide an overview for 2021 to date, accounting for the time spent in each vaccination state. We also report monthly ASMRs, which show the changes in the rates at different points in the year and provide age breakdowns of these rates. We discuss the factors which could explain the changes in the rates over time. \nThe age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19), non-COVID-19 deaths and deaths from all causes by vaccination status group for all available weeks in 2021 are shown in Table 1. These ASMRs are calculated in person-years at risk to account for the different time people spent in each vaccination state in the period. Counts of deaths and the number of person-years at risk used to calculate these rates are provided in the reference tables.\nThe overall ASMR for deaths involving COVID-19 between 1 January and 31 October 2021 was 96% lower in people who had received a second dose at least 21 days prior compared with unvaccinated people, which corresponds to a 28 times higher mortality rate for unvaccinated people. In our previous publication, which covered 2 January to 24 September, the ASMR for deaths involving COVID-19 was 97% lower, which corresponds to a 32 times higher mortality rate for unvaccinated people.\nThe all-cause ASMRs for the year-to-date were lower in the first three weeks after a vaccine dose than in subsequent weeks after that dose. This could be because of a \u201chealthy vaccinee effect\u201d where people who are ill (either due to COVID-19 or another relevant illness) are likely to delay vaccination. Therefore, the people who have been recently vaccinated are, in the short term, in better health than the general population. The same is true for deaths involving COVID-19 after the second dose. This is likely because the healthy vaccinee effect where people who know or suspect they have COVID-19 delay vaccination until recovered, has a bigger effect here than the difference in protection offered by the vaccine within and following the first three weeks after vaccination. \nAs the ASMRs are calculated over a period during which the underlying mortality rates are changing, it is relevant where the majority of the person-years fall in this period for the different vaccination status groups. The ASMRs calculated for specific months highlight changes over time, however they can become less meaningful if the population in a particular vaccination status group becomes very small, and less representative of the general population. Therefore we present the overall figure, which is less affected by composition effects, and the monthly figures over time, to show the changes over the year.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the overall monthly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) for people who had received two vaccination doses at least 21 days ago were lower than those for people who have received one dose at least 21 days ago or are unvaccinated in every week of the period. The monthly ASMRs for people who had received only one dose at least 21 days ago were lower than the ASMRs for people who were unvaccinated in most months, but were higher than those for people who had received two vaccination doses at least 21 days ago. \nThe ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 varied substantially over the period, largely following changes in COVID-19 infection rates. Towards the beginning of 2021, COVID-19 infection rates were high, resulting in high ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 for unvaccinated people, and, to a lesser extent, for people who had received their first dose. During the late spring and early summer, the ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 were low for all vaccination statuses, because infection rates were low. In July, as the COVID-19 infection rates again rose to high levels, the ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 increased in all groups, but not to the levels seen previously earlier in the year. \nIn recent months, people who had received two doses remained at much lower risk of death involving COVID-19 than unvaccinated people, but the relative risk was lower than in the second wave. This could be caused by various factors including the changing underlying COVID-19 infection rate, changing levels of immunity from prior infection, changing dominant variants and the changing composition of the groups. More information on factors driving changes of ASMRs by vaccination status over time is provided in our blog.\nFor all age groups, the rate of deaths involving COVID-19 was lowest in people who received the second vaccination at least 21 days ago throughout the year (Figure 1) and mortality rates increased with age. For people aged 70 years or over, the rate of deaths involving COVID-19 showed similar patterns as the ASMRs for the whole population, with higher mortality rates in February (following the second wave of infections), followed by another, lower peak in mortality rates following the third wave in July. For younger people the death rates in unvaccinated people were roughly similar in the second and third waves. \nDifferences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between vaccination statuses, and changes over time, may not solely be because of the effect of the vaccine on reducing the risk of COVID-19 death. Characteristics other than age, such as health status, level of deprivation, and ethnicity, may vary between the vaccination groups, and over time as people move groups, because of the selective roll-out of the vaccination programme and differences in uptake. As these characteristics can influence mortality rates, they may explain some of the differences in mortality between the groups. Published studies have calculated vaccine effectiveness using observational methods, taking into account known differences in characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated people. All three vaccines administered in the UK have reported vaccine effectiveness against mortality of over 90%. However, the differences in these characteristics may result in differences in non-COVID-19 mortality. \nIf the vaccination programme had been rolled out at random, we would expect little difference in non-coronavirus (COVID-19) mortality between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. However, the non-COVID-19 age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) shown in Figure 2 (and all-cause ASMRs, included in the reference tables) highlight differences in non-COVID-19 mortality between people with different vaccination status, and these differences are changing over time.\nCharacteristics other than age, such as health status, level of deprivation, and ethnicity, may vary between the vaccination groups, and over time as people move groups, because of the selective roll-out of the vaccination programme and differences in uptake. These characteristics can influence mortality rates, especially from causes other than COVID-19. We expect to see a large effect because of health status in particular because of the prioritisation of the clinically extremely vulnerable and those with underlying health conditions for vaccination.\nData from Figure 2 shows sharp rises in non-COVID-19 mortality first in the unvaccinated, then in each vaccination group in turn as people passed through the groups. The rise was particularly pronounced for people who received the first dose at least 21 days ago. The age-specific non-COVID-19 mortality rates also show similar trends occurring in each age group. The rises were more pronounced for older age groups and occurred later in the year for younger age groups, who were vaccinated later. The month in which people in each age group first became eligible for vaccination is indicated on the plots. In recent weeks, the rates for all vaccination status groups apart from those who received the first dose at least 21 days ago were similar. \nThe differences in non-COVID-19 mortality rates by vaccination status reflect changes in the composition of the groups. The rises in non-COVID-19 mortality in the each of the vaccination status groups occurred when the population left in that vaccination status group is very small and consists of those people who did not receive the vaccine when eligible. This small population has poorer health than the general population. Therefore, this rise is not linked to the vaccination, but is driven by changes in the composition of the group. For instance, Figure 3 (middle figure) shows the percentage of the population in the 70 to 79 years age group belonging to each vaccination status group over time, along with the age-specific mortality rate (top figure). As the population in each vaccination status group decreased sharply, the percentage of the group who were in poor health increased sharply, then gradually dropped. These changes follow the trend of the sharp rises seen in the age-specific and age-standardised mortality rates.\nOne potential reason for the increased percentage of people in poorer health who had had just one vaccination dose after most people have had their second dose, could be because people who are in ill health or have planned surgery may delay their second vaccine. Therefore, the people who remain in the first vaccination group after most have moved on would have higher mortality rates. As deaths occurred in those most at risk, the mortality rate then decreased. In addition, those who received the vaccine later, could have done so because of ill health or concern about a comorbidity, and therefore also display higher mortality rates.\nIn the younger age groups, the changes in non-COVID-19 mortality rates are likely to reflect the effect of prioritisation of people who were clinically vulnerable. For the 18 to 39 years age group, we see lower COVID-19 mortality among people who had received their second dose 21 days or more ago compared to unvaccinated people (Figure 1). We observe higher non-COVID-19 mortality at the beginning of the period in this group for people who had received their first dose 21 days or more ago. It then decreased as the general population became eligible for vaccination. The same pattern is observed later in the year, for people who had received their second dose 21 days or more ago. Figure 4 shows the age-specific mortality rates for 18 to 39-year-olds (standardised within the age group) for non-COVID-19 deaths, for all people and for people with different health status (determined by the number of hospitalisations since 1 January 2020 and the number of comorbidities defined by QCOVID diagnosed between 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2020). \nStratifying by health status shows that people in poorer health had higher risk of mortality regardless of their vaccination status. Within health status, there was no longer a statistically significant difference between the second dose vaccination status group and unvaccinated for most weeks. There is also a much-reduced difference, or no statistically significant difference between the first vaccination status group and unvaccinated. This indicates that the increased risk of non-COVID-19 mortality was likely because of people in poorer health aged 18 to 39 years had been vaccinated first, and therefore were over-represented in the 21 days or more after second dose group until more people had received the vaccine.\nThe analysis of the non-COVID-19 ASMRs show that the changing composition of the groups of people in the different vaccination statuses can have a large effect on mortality, thereby limiting the insights that can be gained from these comparisons. However, the monthly ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 are consistently lower for those who had the second dose at least 21 days ago compared to those who are unvaccinated, demonstrating the effect that the vaccine is having on reducing COVID-19 mortality. We will continue to publish updates and analysis on deaths by vaccination status.\n\nDeaths by vaccination status, England Dataset | Released 9 December 2021 Weekly and 28-day age-standardised mortality rates and age-specific rates for deaths involving COVID-19 and all deaths by vaccination status. \n\n\n", "summary": "COVID-19 mortality was consistently lower after two vaccine doses\nTaking age into account, the risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) was consistently lower for people who had two vaccine doses at least 21 days before compared with those who were unvaccinated.\nThis was seen in all age groups over the period between 1 January and 31 October 2021.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) is not a measure of vaccine effectiveness and varies over time. This is because of changes in:\n - the composition of vaccination status groups (particularly differences in health)\n - infection rates\n - seasonal mortality rates\n - dominant variants\n - levels of immunity from prior infection\n - vaccine waning\nAs a result, the ASMR involving COVID-19 for those who had received two doses of a vaccine, compared with unvaccinated people, has changed over time.\nIn February 2021, the ASMR for deaths involving COVID-19 was 99% lower for people who had a second dose of a vaccine at least 21 days before than those who were unvaccinated. In October, it was 78% lower.\nThe ASMR for the whole period covered (1 January to 31 October 2021) was 96% lower among those who had a second dose at least three weeks before, compared with unvaccinated people.\nIn the following charts, \"person-years\" account for both the number of people and the amount of time spent in each vaccination status.\nAll-cause ASMRs for the year to date have been lower in the first three weeks after a vaccine dose. This could be because of a \u201c\u2018healthy vaccinee effect\u201d\u2019 \u2013 as people who are ill are more likely to delay vaccination.\nNon-COVID-19 mortality rates help show the impact of the changing composition of people in vaccination status on mortality rates.\nRates become higher as those who are clinically vulnerable and prioritised for vaccination move through these groups.\nWhen the healthier population follow, there is a corresponding decrease in mortality rates.\nIn addition, when most people in an age group have been vaccinated, the small unvaccinated population has poorer health, resulting in higher mortality rates.\n", "id": 158}, {"document": "In the fortnight ending 31 December 2021, people previously infected with coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to be less likely to test positive than people not previously infected, however this effect was smaller than seen in the past.\nThose who reported receiving one of any COVID-19 vaccines 15 to 90 days ago, a second Pfizer vaccine 15 to 180 days ago, or any three vaccinations (including booster vaccinations) were all less likely to test positive than those who were not vaccinated, in the fortnight ending 31 December 2021; however, these effects are smaller than what we have seen previously.\u00a0\nThe risk of reinfection was 16 times higher in the Omicron-dominant period (20 December 2021 to 9 January 2022) compared with the Delta-dominant period (17 May to 19 December 2021).\nFrom 2 July 2020 to 9 January 2022, people who were unvaccinated were approximately twice as likely to be reinfected than people who had their second vaccine 14 to 89 days ago.\nFrom 2 July 2020 to 9 January 2022, people were more likely to be reinfected if they had a lower viral load (higher Ct value) at their first positive infection.\nBetween 9 and 31 December 2021, people with Omicron-compatible infections were substantially less likely than people with Delta-compatible infections to report loss of taste or loss of smell.\nIn this bulletin, we present the latest analysis of the characteristics associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 disease in the UK. Then we focus on reinfections and present analysis on characteristics associated with getting reinfected with coronavirus (COVID-19). Finally, we present analysis on the symptoms profile of strong positive cases, including strong positive Delta- and Omicron-compatible cases, and then on socially distanced and physical contacts. This is part of our series of\u00a0analysis on the characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the population living in private residential households. We exclude those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. In communal establishments, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different.\nWe include current COVID-19 infections, which we define as testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

Our\u00a0methodology article\u00a0provides more information on the methods used for our models.\nThis analysis was first presented in our\u00a0analysis of populations in the UK by risk of testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19)\u00a0September 2021 publication, which provides a more detailed explanation of the methods used. We present findings for the most recent fortnight in this section, but a longer data\u00a0time series covering 17 July to 31 December 2021 is available in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19, UK dataset.\nEstimates of the likelihood of some specific characteristics affecting an individual testing positive can fluctuate from one fortnight to another, meaning that findings that were significant in one period may not necessarily be significant in another period. This may be because the effect of a characteristic is genuinely changing, or because we do not have sufficient individuals with that characteristic in a particular fortnight to exclude any differences we find being down to chance.\nOur latest data for the fortnight ending 31 December 2021 show similar conclusions to our last publication, namely:\nthose who reported receiving one of any coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines 15 to 90 days ago, a second Pfizer vaccine 15 to 180 days ago, or any three vaccinations (including booster vaccinations) were all less likely to test positive than those who are not vaccinated; however, these effects are smaller than what we have seen previously\nthose who had previously been infected with COVID-19 continued to be less likely to test positive than those who had not, however this effect was smaller than we have seen in the past\nthose who were previously infected during the period when Delta was dominant were even less likely to test positive again than those infected in the Alpha dominant or pre-Alpha period\u00b9\nfemales continued to be less likely to test positive than males\nethnic minorities continued to be less likely to test positive than people of White ethnicity\npeople aged under 40 years were more likely to test positive than older people\nin rural villages, those living in larger households were more likely to test positive than those living in smaller households; in more urban areas, there was no relationship between household size and testing positive\npeople who report regularly using lateral flow tests continued to be more likely to test positive compared with those who do not; this is likely related to those at a higher risk of infection being encouraged to take regular lateral flow tests\nIn the same fortnight:\nthose living in multigenerational households were less likely to test positive than those not living in multigenerational households\nthose with a disability, as well as those who live with someone with a disability, were less likely to test positive than those not living in a household where someone has a disability\npeople who had contact with a hospital, as well as people who live with someone who had contact with a hospital, were less likely to test positive, in comparison with those living in households where no one had contact\npeople living in more-deprived areas were more likely to test positive than those living in less-deprived areas\nthose who work outside of the home were more likely to test positive than those who work from home\npeople working in the hospitality sector were more likely to test positive in comparison with other working adults\nPeople who had received any one COVID-19 vaccine, a second Pfizer vaccine 15 to 180 days ago, or any three COVID-19 vaccines (including boosters) were all less likely to test positive. However, there was no statistical evidence that having any other second vaccine (AstraZeneca, Moderna, or a second Pfizer vaccine more than 180 days ago) affected a person's likelihood of testing positive in the fortnight ending 31 December 2021. This is different to findings reported previously, which found that those who had received two of any COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to test positive than those who were not vaccinated, regardless of time after the second dose. The recent change in findings for second vaccines may be because of the priority for vaccine rollout. The majority of those who received a second AstraZeneca were older, and most will now have received a third vaccine. This means that fewer people will have received a second AstraZeneca vaccine only (and no third vaccine) in this latest time period analysed. In addition, the group \"Second AstraZeneca vaccine, 15 to 180 days ago\" is predominantly made up of people who had a vaccine at least 90 days ago, when the vaccine is less likely to be as effective.\n.XLSX\n.XLSX\nAn additional model examines the effect of behavioural characteristics on the likelihood of testing positive, while controlling for the core demographic variables and significant other characteristics shown earlier in this section. This means that we can identify which behavioural characteristics are associated with testing positive while taking other differences between people reporting different behaviours into account.\nOur findings suggest that in the fortnight ending 31 December 2021:\npeople who had physical contact with those aged 18 to 69 years were more likely to test positive than those who had not\nthose who spent more time socialising with others outside their household continued to be more likely to test positive\nthose who spent more time at other people's homes were more likely to test positive\nadults who reported never wearing a face covering in enclosed spaces were more likely to test positive than those who reported always wearing a face covering\n.XLSX\nThis section looks at the rate of coronavirus (COVID-19) reinfections in the UK, from 2 July 2020 to 9 January 2022.\nWe first presented results of reinfection analysis in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of reinfections of COVID-19: June 2021. The technical article provides a more detailed explanation of the methods used, some of which have since been updated. Improvements to our modelling approach apply to data published from 6 October 2021 onwards. Tables 5a to 5e in the\u00a0accompanying dataset\u00a0for this bulletin contain our updated reinfections data.\nThe analysis presented in this section includes individuals who have had at least one positive test recorded in the survey and meet our criteria for being \"at risk\" of reinfection where:\n120 days have elapsed since an individual's first positive test in the survey and their most recent test result was negative\nif 120 days have not passed since their first positive test in the survey, the individual's last positive test has been followed by four consecutive negative tests\nAn individual being classified as \"at risk\" reflects that it was possible for a test of theirs to be considered a reinfection if it turns out to be positive. The \"at-risk period\" refers to the period following the first time we could have defined a reinfection. A reinfection is therefore defined as when an \"at risk\" individual has a positive test.\nThe analysis included 26,528 participants \"at risk\" of reinfection and 917 reinfections identified between 2 July 2020 and 9 January 2022. The median time between positive episodes in those with reinfections was 302 days or almost 10 months (Table 5b in the\u00a0accompanying dataset\u00a0for this bulletin).\nThe estimated rate for all reinfections including those with a lower viral load was 20.8 per 100,000 participant days at risk (95% confidence interval: 19.5 to 22.2) over the entire at-risk period. This is an increase from our previously published findings up to 1 December 2021, where we estimated the rate for all reinfections was 12.7 per 100,000 participant days at risk (95% confidence interval: 11.6 to 13.9) over the entire at-risk period. This increase is likely driven by the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\nViral load is approximated by\u00a0Cycle threshold (Ct )\u00a0values, which are lower with a high viral load. The estimated rate for reinfections with a high viral load (strong positive test where the Ct value was less than 30) was 14.4 per 100,000 participant days at risk (95% confidence interval: 13.3 to 15.6) over the entire at-risk period. Participant days at risk and Ct values are further defined in our\u00a0Glossary. This is an increase from our previously published findings up to 1 December 2021, where we estimated the rate for reinfections with a high viral load was 7.2 per 100,000 participant days at risk (95% confidence interval: 6.4 to 8.1) over the entire at-risk period. This increase is likely driven by the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\nBefore 17 May 2021, infections were likely to be compatible with Alpha or other variants. From 17 May to 19 December 2021, substantial numbers of infections compatible with the Delta variant were observed in the survey. From 20 December 2021 onwards, substantial numbers of infections compatible with the Omicron variant were observed in the survey. We looked at the difference between initial infections and reinfections in terms of viral load, classifying each by the time period the reinfection occurred in.\nPeople with a high viral load (low Ct value) in their first episode tend to have a low viral load (higher Ct value) in the second episode.\u00a0Some people with low viral load (high Ct values) in the first episode have a high viral load (low Ct values) in the second, perhaps suggesting a weaker immune response to the first infection.\u00a0Others have a lower viral load (high Ct values) at\u00a0both\u00a0episodes. This could be because of monthly follow ups occurring when participants are nearing the end of infection in both episodes.\u00a0\nThe likelihood of people reinfected with COVID-19 and reporting symptoms varies by variant. Before 17 May 2021 (Alpha-dominant period), the likelihood of an individual having symptoms in their second infection was lower compared with their first infection. From 17 May to 19 December 2021 (Delta-dominant period), people were more likely to have symptoms of COVID-19 in their second infection than in their first infection. From 20 December 2021 onwards (Omicron-dominant period), people were just as likely to have symptoms of COVID-19 in their second infection as their first infection.\nThis section presents updated analysis of the risk factors associated with a coronavirus (COVID-19) reinfection identified among participants across the UK between 2 July 2020 and 9 January 2022.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of reinfections of COVID-19: June 2021\u00a0outlines the model used to investigate how the rate of reinfection varies over time and between individuals. This model explores multiple factors including age, sex, ethnicity, Cycle threshold (Ct) value observed in the initial infection, deprivation, household size, work in patient-facing healthcare, long-term health conditions, vaccination status and the period during which an individual was at risk. For updated methodology, please refer to our technical article.\nWe define the Alpha-dominant period as prior to 17 May 2021, the Delta-dominant period as 17 May to 19 December 2021, and the Omicron-dominant period as 20 December 2021 onwards.\nThis analysis included 26,528 participants \"at risk\" of reinfection and 917 reinfections identified between 2 July 2020 and 9 January 2022. The median time between positive episodes in those with reinfections was 302 days or almost 10 months.\nThe risk of reinfection by characteristic is measured in terms of hazard ratios and presented in Figure 4. In addition to the variables presented in Figure 4, we also looked at the risk of reinfection during the different variant dominant periods. This found that when compared with the Delta-dominant period, the risk of reinfection was 16 times higher in the Omicron-dominant period (95% confidence interval: 14 to 19 times higher). In contrast, people were 42% less likely to be reinfected in the Alpha-dominant period than in the Delta-dominant period (95% confidence interval: 21% to 57% lower).\nPeople who were unvaccinated were approximately twice as likely to be reinfected\u00a0than\u00a0people who had\u00a0their second\u00a0vaccine 14 to 89 days ago (95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 2.7 times higher). People who had their second vaccine over 90 days ago were also more likely to be reinfected than people who had their second vaccine more recently from 14 to 89 days ago.\nPeople who reported symptoms within 35 days of the first positive test in their first infection were less likely to be reinfected. People were more likely to be reinfected if they had a lower viral load (higher Ct value) at the first positive episode.\nOlder people were slightly less likely to be reinfected, with a 6% lower risk (95% confidence interval: 1% to 10% lower) for every 10 years.\nHazard ratios for all characteristics included in the model and for Ct values can be found in Tables 6a and 6b in the\u00a0accompanying dataset.\n.XLSX\nData for the risk of reinfection by Ct value and associated confidence intervals as compared with the reference category (Ct value of 20) are available in Table 6b of the\u00a0accompanying dataset. The data show that the risk of reinfection is higher in individuals who had a higher Ct value (lower viral load) at their first infection; this may be because of a weaker immune response in \"milder\" primary infections.\nData for the risk of reinfection over time are available in Table 6c in the\u00a0accompanying dataset.\nThis section presents analysis based on all individuals who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) with a strong positive test (Cycle threshold\u00a0(Ct) value less than 30) between 1 December 2020 and 31 December 2021 in the UK. The analysis considers what percentage of these individuals reported symptoms\u00b9 within 35 days of the first positive test. We present grouped and individual symptoms analysis for the whole of the UK split by month, and for the whole time period split by UK country, all of which can be found in Tables 8a to 8f in the\u00a0accompanying dataset.\nIn addition, in this publication we have included analysis of the percentage of people who reported symptoms split by Omicron-compatible infections and Delta-compatible infections. As Omicron began growing very rapidly in the UK in early December, the Omicron- compatible cases we captured in the survey in early December were more likely to be at an early stage when people are less likely to be experiencing symptoms.\nFor this reason, our comparison of Omicron-compatible and Delta-compatible infections is based on the period between 9 and 31 December 2021. However, it is still possible that Omicron infections in the remainder of December are\u00a0disproportionately earlier stage infections. If this is the case, then\u00a0this analysis may underestimate\u00a0the percentage of Omicron cases that are symptomatic in December 2021. However, any such underestimation would likely not be large enough to\u00a0cancel out substantial differences between Omicron and Delta variants.\nThe average viral load of the people testing positive for COVID-19 also affects whether they are likely to report symptoms. We have seen that the viral load of strong positive results increased during June and July 2021, as measured by decreases in the average Ct value (see Glossary, for more information on Ct values). This will also affect the prevalence of symptoms within these strong positive cases.\nIn December 2021, 58% (95% confidence interval: 57% to 59%) of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the UK with a strong positive test reported any specific symptoms1. This was a decrease from November 2021, where 65% (95% confidence interval: 63% to 67%) of people testing positive reported symptoms. This decrease appears to be driven by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and may also be partly driven by\u00a0early-stage infections where people may be less likely to experience symptoms.\nThe percentage of people reporting symptoms in all groups (\"any\", \"classic\", \"loss of taste or smell\", \"gastrointestinal\") decreased between November and December 2021; with a particularly sharp decrease seen for loss of taste or smell. These changes appear to be driven by the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\nThe percentage reporting each group of symptoms are similar for each country, although slightly lower in Northern Ireland. Our sampling method for Northern Ireland is different to the other nations, inviting only people who have previously participated in a Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) survey.\n\n!\n\nBecause of a smaller number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison with England in our sample, the confidence intervals are wider indicating higher uncertainty. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\nIn the UK, the most commonly reported symptoms have consistently been cough, fatigue and headache. The least commonly reported symptoms have consistently been abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and nausea or vomiting. However, most reported symptoms decreased in December 2021 compared with November 2021, and the percentage of people reporting a sore throat increased in the same month.\nThese changes appear to be driven by the Omicron variant. Our analysis shows that between 9 and 31 December 2021, 57% (95% confidence interval: 55% to 58%) of people with Omicron-compatible infections and 59% (95% confidence interval: 57% to 61%) of people with Delta-compatible infections in the UK reported any specific symptoms\u00b9. It is important to note that this analysis is averaged over a period where we are transitioning from one variant-dominant period to another, so caution is advised in interpreting this early analysis at the start of the Omicron-dominant period.\nPeople with Omicron-compatible infections were more likely to report a sore throat and less likely to report most other symptoms, in comparison with people with Delta-compatible infections. However, the percentage of people reporting a sore throat who tested negative for COVID-19 has also increased recently. This means that the higher percentage of people with Omicron-compatible infections reporting a sore throat may be because of \u00a0other infections, such as the common cold or flu.\nPeople with Omicron-compatible infections are substantially less likely than people with Delta-compatible infections to report loss of taste or loss of smell. While it is possible that some of these differences may be partly driven by early-stage infections where people are less likely to be symptomatic, the stark differences in reported loss of taste and loss of smell are too large to be caused by this.\n.XLSX\nWe report on recent trends in this section, but the full data time series for this analysis, which covers the period between 18 July 2020 and 31 December 2021 for England, and 26 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, is available in the\u00a0accompanying dataset. The analysis for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland starts at a later date because data collection started later in these countries. Our estimates have been weighted to be representative of the total population in each of the four UK countries.\nIn the fortnight ending 31 December 2021, adults had\u00a0fewer\u00a0socially distanced contacts but\u00a0slightly\u00a0more\u00a0physical\u00a0contacts\u00a0than they had had previously. In some UK countries the\u00a0size of this change was\u00a0relatively small. The increase in physical contacts is likely because of\u00a0increased mixing over Christmas. The decrease in socially distanced contacts may be because of people not being at work\u00a0or changing their behaviour to avoid having to self-isolate on Christmas day.\nIn the same fortnight, children reported fewer physical and socially distanced contacts\u00a0with other children (corresponding to the school Christmas holidays), but slightly more physical contact with people aged 70 years and over.\nSchool term dates, and coronavirus (COVID-19) related school policies vary by nation and this is reflected in the data. Information on the schedule for school re-openings can be viewed for\u00a0England,\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland. Information on lockdown easing can be viewed for\u00a0England,\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland.\nOur findings are generally similar to findings on socially distanced and physical contact reported in the\u00a0Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), which examines the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19, UK Dataset | Released 19 January 2022 Characteristics of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency and Wellcome Trust.

This is an increase from 12.7 reinfections per 100,000 participant days at risk in the period up to 1 December 2021. The risk of reinfection during the Omicron-dominant period (20 December 2021 onwards) was 16 times higher than in the Delta-dominant period (between May and December 2021).\nParticipant days at risk refer to the number of days a positive test result would count as a reinfection. Further explanation is available in the main bulletin on the characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19.\nReinfections with a high viral load increased in the latest period, again likely driven by the Omicron variant. During the Omicron-dominant period, those reinfected with COVID-19 were just as likely to have symptoms in their second infection as their first.\nPeople who were unvaccinated were around twice as likely to be reinfected than those who had their second vaccine 14 to 89 days ago. People who had their second vaccine more than 90 days ago were also more likely to be reinfected.\nIn the fortnight ending 31 December 2021, people who received one COVID-19 vaccine, a second Pfizer vaccine 15 to 180 days ago, or any three vaccines (including boosters) were less likely to test positive, as were those who had been infected with COVID-19 previously.\nPeople living in deprived areas, those who work outside of their home and people working in the hospitality sector were all more likely to test positive.\nBetween 9 and 31 December 2021, people with Omicron-compatible infections were substantially less likely than people with Delta-compatible infections to report loss of taste or loss of smell.\n", "id": 176}, {"document": "Patterns of crime in the year ending September 2021 have been significantly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and government restrictions on social contact. There was significant variation in the level of restrictions in place across this time period and, at times, further variation across regions. This creates a challenge in isolating the level of impact that restrictions may have had on patterns of crime. \nThe number of incidents decreased for many types of crime during periods of national lockdowns. However, police recorded crime data show indications that over the last six months, certain offence types are returning to or exceeding the levels seen before the pandemic. This pattern has not yet emerged in the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW)1 data, possibly reflecting the time lag in recording incidents via the survey. \nFraud and computer misuse offences do not follow the lockdown-related pattern of reduced victimisation, and increases in these offences more than offset the reductions seen for other types of crime.\nOverall, Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) estimates provide the best indicator of long-term trends in crime. Estimates from the TCSEW for the year ending September 2021 compared with the pre-coronavirus year ending September 20192 show:\na 14% increase in total crime, driven by a 47% increase in fraud and computer misuse\ncrime excluding fraud and computer misuse decreased by 14%, largely driven by an 18% decrease in theft offences\nThe TCSEW shows little change in total number of incidents of violence but a 27% decrease in the number of victims of violent crime. This is largely driven by falls in violence where the offender was a stranger3, where the number of victims has dropped by 50%, in part reflecting the closure of the night-time economy for several months of the year.\nPolice recorded crime data give more insight into lower-volume but higher-harm crimes that the survey does not cover or does not capture well. Compared with the year ending September 2020 they show:\nlittle change in the number of homicides, with 666 offences recorded (this is a 5% increase excluding the Grays lorry incident)\na 9% decrease in the number of police recorded offences involving firearms\na 10% decrease in offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime)\nSexual offences recorded by the police were at the highest level recorded within a 12-month period (170,973 offences) in the year ending September 2021, a 12% increase from the same period in 2020. Rape accounted for 37% of these offences and the year ending September 2021 saw the highest recorded annual number of rape offences to date (63,136 offences). \nWithin these annual figures, the number of recorded sexual and rape offences were lower during periods of lockdown but there have been substantial increases since April 2021. However, caution is needed when interpreting the level of police recorded sexual offences. Changes in the figures may reflect a number of factors including the impact of high-profile cases and campaigns on victims\u2019 willingness to report incidents. \n\n!\n\nCrime estimates for the year ending September 2021 best reflect the current extent of crime experienced by the population resident in households (Appendix Table A2). However, new telephone-based survey (TCSEW) estimates are not directly comparable with previous survey (CSEW) estimates because of changes to the sample and questionnaire (see Section 14). Percentage changes and long-term trends are presented using figures adjusted for these differences (Appendix Table A3).\n\n\n\nThe Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) began data collection on 20 May 2020 to capture trends in crime while normal face-to-face interviewing was suspended following restrictions on social contact during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nAccording to TCSEW estimates, adults aged 18 years and over experienced 12.9 million offences in the year ending September 2021 (Appendix Table A2) including fraud and computer misuse. There were decreases across a range of individual crime types, particularly amongst theft offences. However, these were more than offset by rises in fraud and computer misuse offences (see Section 9), resulting in a 14% increase in overall levels of crime since the year ending September 2019.\nTotal crime excluding fraud and computer misuse decreased by 14% compared with the year ending September 2019. This was largely driven by an 18% decrease in theft offences (Appendix Table A3). These decreases were related to the coronavirus pandemic and government instructions to limit social contact.\nFor the crime types and population it covers, the face-to-face Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a better indicator of long-term trends than police recorded crime. It is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police or police recording practices. Our comparability report has shown that TCSEW estimates can be directly compared with these long-term CSEW estimates when certain adjustments are applied (Appendix Table A3).\nFurther information on these changes is available in the Measuring the data section. \nSince the mid-1990s, there have been long-term falls in overall CSEW crime estimates (Figure 1). Long-term trends vary by crime types. For all headline figures, including a data time series, see Appendix tables.\nThe latest estimates show that 8 in 10 adults did not experience any of the crimes covered by the TCSEW in the year ending September 2021 (Figure 2).\nThe TCSEW also showed that the likelihood of being a victim of crime varied by demographic characteristics. For more information, see the annual trend and demographic tables.\n\n!\n\nImprovements to recording processes and practices by the police, expansions of the recorded crime collection to include new offences, variations in police activity, more victims reporting crime, and genuine increases in some types of crime, have each made substantial contributions to rises in recorded crime in recent years. This effect has been more pronounced for some crime types. For some types of offence these figures do not provide reliable trends in crime.\n\n\n\nThe police recorded 5.8 million crimes in England and Wales in the year ending September 2021; this is a 2% increase compared with the previous year. However, the number of offences fell 1% (to 4.9 million) when excluding fraud and computer misuse. \nPolice recorded crime has fluctuated across the year ending September 2021 and hides a lot of variation by crime type. Most of the fluctuations can be attributed to the introduction and subsequent easing of national lockdown restrictions throughout the year alongside more normal seasonal variations for some crime types. \nTotal police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) in the year ending September 2021 saw the lowest levels of crime during the first part of the year compared with the two years prior. This coincides with the reintroduction of tighter restrictions on social contact and national lockdowns put in place. The number of offences recorded in a single month was lowest in February 2021 (333,740 offences), but began to rise from March 2021 onwards as national restrictions began to ease (Figure 3). \nCompared with the previous year, recorded crime between July and September 2021 was 6% higher than the same period in 2020, reflecting a similar rise seen in the previous quarter (April to June 2021). This increase was likely a reflection of the national restrictions in place during these periods. Levels of crime between July and September 2021 have now returned to similar levels seen in July to September 2019.\nTotal police recorded crime including fraud and computer misuse followed a similar but less pronounced pattern to crime that excludes these offences. Offences recorded by Action Fraud or referred to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) were 24% higher in the year ending September 2021 compared with the year ending September 2020. \n\n\nFigure 3: Police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) fluctuated with changes in national lockdown restrictions\nEngland and Wales, monthly figures (October 2018 to September 2019, October 2019 to September 2020, and October 2020 to September 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nPolice recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 3: Police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) fluctuated with changes in national lockdown restrictions\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nInformation on case outcomes can be found in Home Office Crime outcomes in England and Wales.\u2003\u2003\nThe police recorded 666 homicide offences in the year ending September 2021, a 1% decrease the previous year (671 offences). The year ending September 2020 included the Grays lorry incident, which involved the death of 39 people. Excluding this incident from the previous year\u2019s homicide count, the number of homicides showed a 5% increase (from 632 to 666 offences) in the year ending September 2021. \n\n\nFigure 4: Homicide decreased by 1% in the latest year (5% increase excluding Grays lorry incident) \nEngland and Wales, year ending March 2003 to year ending September 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nThe dates shown for the London terrorist attacks in 2005 and 2017, and the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, correspond to when the events occurred, rather than when the homicides were recorded by the police.\nData on homicide offences given in these police recorded crime data will differ from data from the Home Office Homicide Index.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 4: Homicide decreased by 1% in the latest year (5% increase excluding Grays lorry incident) \nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThe rate of homicide in England and Wales remained at 11 per 1 million people in the year ending September 2021. \nThe number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved increased from 256 to 276 offences in the year ending September 2021. Of all recorded homicides in the latest year, the method of killing by knife or sharp instrument was 42% of offences, an increase from 39% in the previous year.\nFor the latest headline figures relating to homicide and more detailed figures including data time series, see Appendix tables and Other related tables. For police force area breakdowns see Police force area data tables.\nPolice recorded crime provides a better measure than the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) of higher-harm but less common types of violence, such as those involving a knife or sharp instrument (knife-enabled crime).\n\n!\n\nFigures referenced in this section are not directly comparable with those previously published because of a change in knife or sharp instrument data collection practices.\n\n\n\nThere was a 10% decrease in knife-enabled crime recorded by the police in the year ending September 2021 (46,239 offences) compared with the previous year. This was driven by a 20% decrease in robbery offences to 16,601. \nThe largest decreases in total knife-enabled crime were seen in October to December 2020 and January to March 2021 with offences down by 16% and 22% compared with respective periods in the previous year. Both these periods coincided with national lockdowns and the highest levels of restrictions on social contact. Police recorded data in the last six months show an increase in knife-enabled crime following the ease of lockdown restrictions, however, levels are still below those seen before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \n\n\nFigure 5: Knife-enabled crime decreased in the latest year driven by a decrease in robbery offences \nEngland and Wales (excluding Greater Manchester Police), year ending March 2011 to year ending September 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nGreater Manchester Police reviewed their recording of offences involving knives or sharp instruments in December 2017 which revealed that they were under-counting these offences. Previous data were not revised at the time and therefore data from Greater Manchester Police are excluded to allow for comparison over time.\nAn adjustment has been made to data prior to the year ending March 2020 for police forces who are now using the NDQIS tool and the total for England and Wales. For more information on the adjustment to the time series and the differences in data collection methods, please see the methodology note \u2018Police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments: methodology changes\u2019.\nOther selected offences include rape, attempted murder, homicide, and sexual assault.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 5: Knife-enabled crime decreased in the latest year driven by a decrease in robbery offences \nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nKnife or sharp instrument offences are concentrated in urban areas1.

This could have been influenced by increases in targeted police action. \nThe Home Office and police forces have continued to roll out a new methodology for identifying recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime). Thirty-three forces have now switched to the National Data Quality Improvement Service (NDQIS) data collection methodology4. The aim is to roll out the new methodology to all forces in England and Wales over the next year. Estimates in this release include a combination of both new and old data collection methods. \nFor more information, including the differences in data collection methods, please see the methodology note Police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments, methodology changes and blog. \nThe latest available provisional admissions data for NHS hospitals in England and Wales reported a 12% decrease in admissions for assault by a sharp object in the year ending September 2021 (to 4,005 admissions).\nFor data relating to knife-enabled crime see Other related tables, for geographic breakdowns see Police force area data tables and for sharp instrument homicides see Appendix tables: homicide in England and Wales. Data related to stop and searches can be found in the Home Office publication Police powers and procedures.\nPolice recorded offences involving firearms decreased by 9% to 5,653 offences in the year ending September 2021 compared with 6,244 offences in the previous year. This decrease may be related to national lockdown restrictions that occurred throughout the year. Offences involving firearms have not returned to levels seen before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and are at their lowest level since the year ending March 2016. \n\n\nFigure 6: Crimes involving firearms show a 9% decrease compared with the previous year\nEngland and Wales year ending March 2003 to year ending September 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nMore explicit guidelines for the classification of weapons introduced on 1 April 2004 may have increased the recording of firearm offences, particularly those committed by imitation weapons.\nExcludes offences involving the use of conventional air weapons, such as air rifles and offences recorded by British Transport Police.

For data relating to offences involving firearms see Other related tables.\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides the best picture of the overall trend in violent crime.\nEstimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 1.8 million violent offences in the year ending September 2021 (Appendix Table A2). Using a comparable dataset adjusted for changes in the sample and questionnaire between the CSEW and TCSEW (see Appendix Table A3), there was no significant change in total violent incidents compared with the year ending September 2019. \nAlthough the TCSEW indicated no change in the total number of violence incidents, there was a 27% decrease in the number of victims compared with the year ending September 2019. (Appendix Table A3). This was largely driven by falls in the prevalence of violence where the offender was a stranger. This likely reflects a decrease in violence taking place in public spaces during national lockdown restrictions. However, there has been a large but non-significant increase in acquaintance violence1. These estimates of violence are not indicative of levels of domestic abuse during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic since the TCSEW was not able to produce such estimates. \nPolice recorded crime data showed a 3% decrease in violence with injury, to 499,880 offences, but a 3% increase in violence without injury (736,185 offences) in the year ending September 2021. \nOverall, total police recorded violence was 8% higher than the previous year. Much of this increase was driven by a rise in the number of stalking and harassment offences, which increased 21% (excluding controlling and coercive behaviour)2 in the year ending September 2021. This may be caused by improvements made by police forces in identifying and recording stalking and harassment offences together with an increased confidence in victims coming forward to report these offences.\nFor more detailed figures relating to violent crime, including a data time series, see Appendix tables.\n\n!\n\nDomestic abuse-related crimes and sexual offences recorded by the police do not provide a reliable measure of trends in these types of crime. Improvements in police recording practices and increased reporting by victims have contributed to increases in recent years. The figures do, however, provide a good measure of the crime-related demand on the police.\n\n\n\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides a more reliable measure of long-term trends in domestic abuse, sexual assault, stalking and harassment. Questions related to these offences had to be suspended with the move to telephone interviewing from May 2020.\nPolice recorded crime data, in isolation, do not provide a measure of prevalence to understand the true extent of domestic abuse. Therefore, figures presented in this release should be interpreted with caution.\nThe police recorded 872,911 offences (excluding fraud) flagged as domestic abuse-related in the year ending September 2021. This represents a 5% increase from 835,319 offences in the same period in the previous year. This included 694,385 violence against the person offences flagged as domestic abuse-related, a 5% increase compared with the year ending September 2020. \nSome of this increase may reflect improvements seen in reporting over the last few years. Following the suspension of the CSEW, we were unable to draw upon analysis from the crime survey as we cannot collect survey data on domestic abuse. This is because of concerns around confidentiality and respondent safeguarding, which limit the types of questions asked via the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales.\nGiven this, we cannot conclude whether there has been an increase in the number of victims of domestic abuse. However, data from victim services suggest that experiences of domestic abuse may have intensified during periods of national lockdown and that victims faced difficulties in safely seeking support under these conditions.\nFurther information and data related to domestic abuse can be found in Domestic abuse in England and Wales overview: November 2021. \nPolice recorded data need to be treated with caution, particularly in the absence of survey data. High levels of non-reporting combined with changes in reporting trends can have a significant impact on sexual offences recorded by the police. Prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of police recorded sexual offences was well below the number of victims estimated by the crime survey, with fewer than one in six victims of rape or assault by penetration reporting the crime to the police. \nThe latest figures may reflect a number of factors, including the impact of high-profile incidents, media coverage and campaigns on people\u2019s willingness to report incidents to the police, as well as a potential increase in the number of victims. The overall trend is also currently difficult to disentangle from the impact of lockdowns. Offences recorded by the police dropped noticeably during the spring 2020 lockdown before rebounding to previous levels in the July to September 2020 quarter. The winter 2020 to 2021 lockdowns saw a smaller reduction in the number of sexual offences recorded by the police but a greater level of increase in these offences in the subsequent quarters. \nThe number of sexual offences recorded by the police showed a 12% increase in the year ending September 2021 (170,973 offences) compared with the same period in the previous year. This is the highest number of sexual offences recorded within a 12-month period, driven by noticeable increases since April 2021. The period July to September 2021 saw the second-highest recorded quarterly figure (47,643 offences), following the highest recorded figures in April to June 2021 (48,131 offences) (see Figure 8).\nRape accounted for 37% of all sexual offences recorded by the police. The number of rape offences in the year ending September 2021 was the highest recorded annual figure to date (63,136 offences). This was driven by a large increase across the last six months of the year, with 17,189 offences recorded in April to June 2021, followed by a further increase to 17,419 offences in July to September 2021. This is the highest number of rape offences recorded within a quarter in England and Wales.\n\n\nFigure 8: July to September 2021 had the highest quarterly police recorded rape offences although sexual offences overall reached the highest level in the previous quarter\nEngland and Wales quarterly data from April 2009 to September 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nOperation Yewtree is the police investigation into allegations of sexual abuse, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 8: July to September 2021 had the highest quarterly police recorded rape offences although sexual offences overall reached the highest level in the previous quarter\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nFurther data related to sexual offences can be found in the Sexual offences in England and Wales overview: year ending March 2020 publication.\nCSEW data on the prevalence of domestic abuse, sexual assault and stalking for the year ending March 2020 can be found in Table S42 in Annual supplementary tables.\nFor information about Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) inspections of police recorded crime and incident data quality see our User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales: Measuring crime during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is the most reliable indicator for long-term trends in the more common types of crime experienced by the general population, such as theft. However, police recorded crime data can give reliable indications of trends in some offences involving theft (for example, domestic burglary) and may provide a better measure of short-term trends. \nThere were 3 million incidents of theft estimated by the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) for the year ending September 2021 (Appendix Table A2). This was an 18% decrease compared with the year ending September 2019 (Appendix Table A3). This large fall was seen across most sub-categories, with the largest fall of 53% seen in the \u201ctheft from the person\u201d offence, followed by a 26% decrease in vehicle-related offences and a 23% decrease in bicycle theft offences.\nA similar pattern was seen in police recorded theft offences, which decreased by 14% in the year ending September 2021 compared with the same period in the previous year, from 1.6 million to 1.4 million offences. This was driven by decreases in offences such as: burglary (21%), theft from the person (20%), vehicle offences (14%) and shoplifting (13%). However, there was a 9% increase in metal theft offences (to 19,044) recorded by the police in England and Wales for the year ending March 2021 following improved recording of catalytic converter theft by the Metropolitan Police. \nPolice recorded robbery offences decreased by 18% in the year ending September 2021 compared with the same period in the previous year, from 75,159 to 61,486 offences. \nAll these falls were likely to be driven by national lockdown restrictions, with non-essential shops and the night-time economy being closed and people spending more time in their homes. However, police recorded crime data indicate theft offences such as theft of a motor vehicle and bicycle theft are starting to return to levels seen before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (see Other related tables). \nFor the latest headline figures relating to theft and for more detailed figures, including data time series, see Appendix tables and our latest Property crime tables.\nFraud estimates do not follow the trend of falling victimisation seen in other crime types over the lockdown periods. Estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 5.1 million fraud offences in the year ending September 2021 (Appendix Table A2). This is a 36% increase compared with the year ending September 2019 (Appendix Table A3). \nThis included large increases in \u201cadvance fee fraud\u201d, \u201cconsumer and retail fraud\u201d and \u201cother fraud\u201d and may indicate fraudsters taking advantage of behaviour changes related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, such as increased online shopping and increased savings. For example, advance fee fraud offences included scams where victims transferred funds to fraudsters for postal deliveries; other fraud included investment opportunity scams. A minority (26%) of these offences resulted in loss of money or property, with no or only partial reimbursement.\nFraud offences reported to the police are recorded and collected by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) from Action Fraud and two industry bodies, Cifas and UK Finance. Action Fraud (the public-facing national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre) reported a 27% rise in fraud offences (to 413,417 offences) compared with the year ending September 2020. The data showed a 42% increase in \u201cfinancial investment fraud\u201d offences in the last year (from 15,702 to 22,372 offences) and an 18% rise in \u201cadvance fee payments\u201d (from 43,555 to 51,407 offences).\nNFIB data showed referrals from Cifas (who report instances of fraud where their member organisations have been victims) increased 5% (to 319,512 offences) compared with the year ending September 2020 while UK Finance reported a 49% increase (to 155,757 offences).\nMany cases recorded separately by UK Finance (via a fraud reporting database called CAMIS) are not reported to the NFIB because they hold insufficient information to be of value from an intelligence perspective. UK Finance reported a 5% increase in fraud incidents (to 3.2 million incidents) in CAMIS. There was a 53% increase in remote banking fraud (to 94,757 incidents), which reflects the greater number of people now regularly using internet, telephone and mobile banking, and the attempts by fraudsters to take advantage of this.\nFor the latest headline figures relating to fraud and for more detailed figures, including a data time series, see Appendix tables, Other related tables and Police force area tables. \nEstimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 1.9 million computer misuse offences in the year ending September 2021 (Appendix Table A2). This was an 89% increase compared with the year ending September 2019, largely driven by a 161% increase in \u201cUnauthorised access to personal information (including hacking)\u201d offences (Appendix Table A3). This included victims\u2019 details being compromised via large-scale data breaches, and victims\u2019 email or social media accounts being compromised. Our most recent Nature of fraud and computer misuse tables reported that 54% of victims were not impacted at all by such incidents.\nThe National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) also reported a 17% increase in \u201cHacking \u2013 personal\u201d offences referred by Action Fraud (from 4,498 to 5,258 offences). See Appendix Table A5. \nThe TCSEW provides a better indication of the volume of computer misuse offences experienced by the adult population as it captures incidents that go unreported to the police. This can be seen by the large difference in the volume of computer misuse offences between the two sources, which also cannot be compared because of differences in coverage.\nFor the latest headline figures relating to computer misuse and for more detailed figures see Appendix tables and Other related tables. Additionally, the Nature of crime: fraud and computer misuse tables hold more in-depth information about these offences from year ending March 2021 data.\nThe Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that 26% of adults personally witnessed or experienced anti-social behaviour in their area in the last 12 months. \nEstimates from the TCSEW showed that 47% of adults noticed individuals breaching virus restrictions in their local area since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began. Of these, 7% reported the breach to the police.\nTCSEW includes a measure of harassment that covers adults experiencing being insulted, called names, threatened or shouted at in public spaces. These estimates showed that 7% of adults experienced these types of harassment in the year ending September 2021. Where a specific perceived reason for the harassment was given, the most common was because of the coronavirus pandemic (27%). This included experiences related to social distancing and lockdown restrictions.\nThe most common non-coronavirus-related perceived reason for these experiences was their education, income level or job (10%), followed by race or ethnicity (6%). \nThe police recorded 1.7 million incidents of anti-social behaviour (ASB) in the year ending September 2021, a 9% decrease compared with the year ending September 2020. Anti-social behaviour was particularly high early on in the year, with the highest number of incidents recorded in January to March 2021 (448,776 offences), which is likely to reflect the reporting of breaches to public health restrictions. This was offset by continued decreases in April to June 2021 (419,128 offences) and July to September 2021 (356,833 offences).\u2003\n\nCrime in England and Wales: Appendix tables  Dataset | Released on 27 January 2022  Long-term trends in Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) crime, estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) and police recorded crime, by offence type.Crime in England and Wales: Coronavirus and crime tables  Dataset | Released on 27 January 2022  Information from a new module of questions included in the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) around perceptions of crime, the police and anti-social behaviour during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and feelings of safety and experiences of harassment.

This could be evidence of fraudsters taking advantage of a switch in behaviour, such as an increase in shopping online.\nThe survey also revealed an 89% increase in computer misuse offences such as hacking compared with the year ending September 2019. This was largely driven by a 161% increase in \u201cunauthorised access to personal information\u201d including hacking. This also included the large-scale data breaches and the compromise of email or social media accounts.\nThere were an estimated 1.9 million computer misuse offences in the year ending September 2021.\n", "id": 181}, {"document": "Helping to protect other people from getting coronavirus (COVID-19) was the main motivation for teenagers getting a COVID-19 vaccine.\nFor 24% of pupils aged 5 to 11 years, their parents said they were unlikely to agree to their child having a COVID-19 vaccine, and reasons for not wanting to vaccinate their children included worrying about the side effects (54%) and waiting to see how it works (49%).\nNearly three-quarters (74%) of secondary school headteachers said pupils wearing face coverings in communal areas was a measure implemented in their school.\nOver three-quarters (76%) of headteachers said that they were \"very willing\" to use CO2 monitors in their schools' classrooms, and 87% of headteachers said that they had been supplied with CO2 monitors.\nThis section contains analysis of the parent and pupil surveys collected between 11 November and 15 December 2021. More information on the collection of data, including sample sizes and weighting, can be found in the Measuring the data section.\nWe found that 70% of pupils in school Year 7 to school Year 13 (aged 12 to 18 years) said they had been vaccinated. Official published figures suggest that on 15 December 2021 when the study closed, 45.9% of 12- to 15-year-olds and 61.5% of 16-to 17-year-olds had received a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. The higher prevalence of self-reported vaccination in our study is likely because of the selection bias of participating students. In our study, COVID-19 vaccine take-up was similar by gender (69% of boys and 71% of girls) but showed differences by age (84% for those aged 16 years and over and 67% for those aged 12 to 15 years). This matches the trend in the official data where COVID-19 vaccine take-up increases with age but is very similar across gender. \u00a0\nWhen asked for all the reasons why they decided to have a COVID-19 vaccine, \"I am helping to protect other people from getting coronavirus\" was a motivation for 63% of pupils. Other motivations included \"it will protect me from getting coronavirus\" (56%) and \"my family have had the vaccine\" (47%). Around 1 in 10 (11%) pupils said someone they respect encouraged them to get the vaccine. When asked to write who this respected person was, the majority of pupils wrote parents, with some stating their family member being vulnerable as the reason.\nOf those who had not received a COVID-19 vaccine, over half (52%) of pupils said they were \"very\" or \"fairly likely\" to get a COVID-19 vaccine this winter if it was offered to them. \nOf those who would be \u201cfairly\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d unlikely to have the vaccine if offered, over half (51%) said they wanted to wait and see how the vaccine works. Other reasons include being worried about the side effects (42%) and \u201cI don\u2019t think I need a COVID-19 vaccine\u201d (34%).\nWe asked parents of children aged 5 to 11 years how likely they were to agree to their child having a COVID-19 vaccine if it was offered to them. For 62% of pupils, parents said they were \"fairly\" or \"very likely\" to agree to their child having a COVID-19 vaccine. For 24% of pupils, parents said they were \"fairly\" or \"very unlikely\" to agree to their child having a COVID-19 vaccine. The remaining responses indicated that parents were undecided whether their child should have a COVID-19 vaccine, or that their child already has received a COVID-19 vaccine. Our results on the likelihood of parents to vaccinate their children are similar to those found in the Coronavirus and social impacts in Great Britain dataset.\nOf those who said they were unlikely to vaccinate their child if offered, the main reasons for not agreeing to get a COVID-19 vaccine were being worried about the side effects (54%) or waiting to see how well the COVID-19 vaccines work (49%).\nThis section contains analysis of the headteacher survey. More information on the collection of data, including sample sizes, can be found in the Measuring the data section.\n\n!\n\nThe data in this section are unweighted. \n\n\n\nHeadteachers in participating schools were asked which infection preventative measures were being implemented at their school in November to December 2021. Implementation of preventative measures may have changed since cases of the Omicron variant started rising in mid-December 2021 after this survey closed. Data has been provided separately for primary and secondary schools in cases where there are substantial differences by type of school, but caution should be used because of small sample sizes.\nAround 9 in 10 (92%) headteachers said that their pupils were sat less than one metre apart from each other in the classroom. Primary schools showed the least distancing, with 95% of primary school headteachers and 84% of secondary school headteachers saying their pupils were sat less than one metre apart.\nTwo-thirds of headteachers (67%) said they were not keeping children in consistent groups or \"bubbles\" (62% of primary schools and 81% of secondary schools). The percentage of primary schools who said they keep pupils in the same classroom all day was 71%. This is likely to reflect how primary schools functioned before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. At the time of collection, there was no policy in place to sit pupils one meter apart or to keep pupils in bubbles.\nThe majority of primary school headteachers (62%) said they were still putting a stop to large gatherings of pupils such as assemblies. This was 45% for secondary schools.\nStaff distancing measures, such as staying at the front of the class (42%) and maintaining a two-metre distance from pupils (35%), are more frequently used in secondary schools. This again is likely to reflect pre-coronavirus conditions, where primary school teachers tend to move around the classroom more.\nA high number of secondary schools implemented students wearing face coverings, with 74% of secondary school headteachers saying pupils wearing face coverings in communal areas was implemented in their school. The national recommendation to wear face coverings in communal areas came in on 29 November 2021. Primary schools have been excluded from this analysis as children aged under 11 years old were exempt from wearing face coverings at the time of the survey. \nA larger proportion of secondary school headteachers reported implementing face coverings for staff in the classroom (42%) than pupil face coverings in the classroom (32%). \nAt the time of collection, the government recommended that children and staff stay at home if they show coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms. Almost all headteachers that completed our survey said that they had implemented these measures; for example, \u201cpupils stay home if they have coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms\u201d (96%) or \u201cstaff stay at home if they have coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms\u201d (95%). However, nearly one-third (30%) of schools said they had major challenges as a consequence of implementing staff staying at home if they have coronavirus symptoms. \nHygiene measures are widely implemented across all schools. Implementation is above 90% for all measures such as washing or sanitising hands for both pupils and staff. In secondary schools, the placement of hand sanitiser in entrance areas (100%) and classrooms (97%) is more prevalent than getting pupils to regularly wash or sanitise their hands (81%).\nThe majority of schools have increased the cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (95%), with 11% of schools saying this was implemented with major challenges. Cleaning the dining hall between groups has been implemented by three-quarters of schools (75%).\nSome measures with low implementation generally focused on remote working for staff. The percentage of schools who allowed staff to stay away from work if they were vulnerable was 9%. The percentage of schools allowing staff to stay away from work if they lived with someone vulnerable was at 3%. \nMeasures focused on school processes also generally saw low implementation, but some exceptions include:\n55% of primary schools were staggering break times\n45% of secondary schools had one-way systems in school corridors\n42% of primary schools were implementing social distancing measures for parents at pick-up and drop-off\nMore detail can be found in the Data section.\nThis section contains analysis of the headteacher survey. More information on the collection of data, including sample sizes, can be found in the Measuring the data section. \n\n!\n\nThe data in this section are unweighted. \n\n\n\nThree-quarters of headteachers (75%) said that they thought ventilation was \u201cvery important\u201d in reducing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in schools, and 70% said they thought ventilation was \u201cvery important\u201d for general health and well-being.\nWhen asked how often headteachers take actions to improve ventilation in their schools, the majority of schools reported opening windows or external doors either periodically or having them open for most of the school day, on a daily basis. For both primary and secondary schools, 93% reported opening windows or external doors periodically every day. \nThe daily use of ventilation systems was more prevalent in secondary schools than primary schools, with 44% of secondary schools reporting using mechanical ventilation systems daily, compared with 26% of primary schools.\nHeadteachers were also asked how challenging each of these measures were to implement. Secondary schools were more likely to report that opening windows or external doors periodically was \u201cvery challenging\u201d, with 29% of secondary schools saying this was very challenging to implement, compared with 9% of primary schools. Nearly half (46%) of primary schools implementing mechanical ventilation systems said they found them \u201cvery challenging\u201d, compared with 18% of secondary schools. Having windows or external doors open throughout most of the school day was reported to be \u201cnot challenging at all\u201d by 51% of primary schools and 38% of secondary schools.\nThe largest barriers to improving ventilation reported by headteachers were temperature (83% stating this was a barrier), heating cost (62%), and rooms becoming too windy or wet (49%). This was similar across primary and secondary schools.\nOver three-quarters (76%) of headteachers said that they were \u201cvery willing\u201d to use CO2 monitors in their schools\u2019 classrooms, and 78% said they\u2019d be \u201cvery willing\u201d to use them in staff only rooms. Furthermore, 87% of headteachers said that they had been supplied with CO2 monitors \u2013 92% of primary school headteachers and 74% of secondary school headteachers. However, around half (51%) said that they had not been supplied with enough monitors to provide the coverage they would like for classrooms and other teaching spaces. Similarly, 56% said they had not been supplied with enough monitors to provide coverage for staff only areas (61% of primary schools and 39% of secondary schools). As of 10 December 2021, the Department for Education (DfE) published that 353,932 monitors had been delivered to schools.\nOf those who had received monitors, 64% of primary school headteachers said all the monitors were in place, compared with 43% of secondary school headteachers. Of those who had put the monitors in place, 59% of primary school headteachers said they were \u201cvery easy\u201d to set up, compared with 32% of secondary school headteachers.\nOf those who had CO2 monitors in place, 19% said they had experienced consistent red readings (1500ppm CO2 concentration). Of those with red readings, 87% said they checked that the monitors worked, and 60% said it was possible to reduce the CO2 levels by increasing ventilation in these spaces. 53% of the teachers with consistent red readings said CO2 levels could not be reduced through improvement works. \nAt the time of collection, nearly a quarter (22%) of headteachers said they had not received any guidance on using CO2 monitors in their school, and 12% said they had received guidance but not yet read it. Of those that received guidance and had read it, we asked on a scale of one to five how useful it was, where one is \"not at all\" and five is \"extremely useful\"; 82% gave a score of three to five.\n\nCOVID-19 Schools Infection Survey, questionnaire and antibody data, England Dataset | Released 1 February 2022 Indicators from the Schools Infection Survey to understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on young people and schools in England. Including antibody data, questionnaire analysis, and breakdowns by age, sex and region where possible. \n\n\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) Schools Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and UK Health Security Agency.\n", "summary": "Just under a quarter of parents unlikely to have children vaccinated\nOf pupils aged 5 to 11 years, 24% had parents who said they were unlikely to agree to their child having a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. Parents of 62% of pupils said they were \u201cfairly\u201d or \u201cvery likely\u201d to agree to their child having a COVID-19 vaccine.\nOver half of parents who didn\u2019t want their children to have a COVID-19 vaccine (54%) said that they worried about the side effects. Meanwhile, 49% said they wanted to wait to see how the vaccine worked.\nWe found that 70% of pupils aged 12 to 18 years taking part in our survey said they had been vaccinated. Official published vaccination figures suggest that on 15 December 2021 when the study closed, 45.9% of 12- to 15-year-olds and 61.5% of 16-to 17-year-olds had received a COVID-19 vaccine.\nWhen asked for their main motivation for getting a COVID-19 vaccine, the majority of teenagers noted that they wanted to help protect other people from getting the virus.\n", "id": 187}, {"document": "There were 594 homicide victims in the year ending March 2021, 79 fewer (a 12% decrease) than the previous year and the lowest number since the year ending March 2016 (540 victims).\nThe preceding year (ending March 2020) included the 39 victims found in a lorry in Grays, Essex and if this incident is excluded from that year, there would have been a smaller (6%) year-on-year decrease.\nThe year ending March 2021 covered certain time periods where coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were in place to limit social contact; these restrictions may have led to a reduction in homicide in this year.\nThe homicide rate was 9.9 per million population, with the rate for males (14 per million population) more than twice that for females (6 per million population).\nThe headline reduction of 12% from the previous year masked different trends between males and females; the number of male victims decreased by 16% (495 to 416) whereas the number of female victims was the same as last year (177 victims).\nAlthough there was a substantial fall in the number of victims who were killed in public places compared with last year (a 27% decrease), there was a 5% increase in victims who were killed in a residential setting, which may explain the different trends between males and females.\nThere were 114 domestic homicides in the year ending March 2021, a similar number to the average over the last five years.\nFor those homicide victims where a suspect had been charged, 92% (380) of victims had suspects who were male.\nThere were 594 victims of homicide in the year ending March 2021, 79 fewer (a 12% decrease) than the previous year and the lowest since the year ending March 2016 (540 victims; Appendix table 1). The year ending March 2020 figures included the 39 victims of human trafficking whose bodies were found in a lorry in Grays, Essex, in October 2019. Excluding this single incident, the number of homicides decreased by 40 (a 6% decrease). \u00a0\nThe year ending March 2021 covered certain time periods where coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were in place to limit social contact. These restrictions may have affected patterns of various crime types during this period, including homicide offences. More recent data from the main police recorded crime return show that the level of homicide increased following the removal of restrictions on 11 April 2021. There were 387 homicides in the six-month period from April to September 2021 compared with 298 in the same period during the previous year. These headline numbers are published as part of the quarterly Crime in England and Wales bulletin.\nThe impact of COVID-19 restrictions appeared to differ by the nature of the homicide. For example, the number of victims who were killed in a public place in the year ending March 2021 fell by 27%, from 350 to 255, whereas the number of homicides in a residential setting increased by 5% (from 323 to 339). Similarly, the number of non-domestic homicides where the victim was aged 16 years or over (which are more likely to occur in a public place) fell by 17% (from 508 to 420) while the number of domestic homicides (114; more likely to occur in a residence) were similar to the previous year (121; Appendix table 13).\nMore information is given in Section 3.\nTo put the raw numbers in context, prevalence rates show the volume of offences as a proportion of the resident population. The incidence rate for homicide remains very low, with 9.9 homicides recorded per million population during the year ending March 2021, the lowest rate since the year ending March 2016 (9.3 per million population).\nThe number of homicides increased from around 300 per year in the early 1960s to consistently over 700 in the early years of this century. This was at a faster rate than population growth over the same period, with the rate of homicide increasing from around 6 per million population in the early 1960s to 15.1 by the year ending March 2002. However, from the peak in the year ending March 2002, the volume of homicides generally decreased while the population of England and Wales continued to grow (excluding the year ending March 2003, when 173 victims of Harold Shipman were recorded). This led to a fall in the homicide rate to a low point of 8.8 per million population in the year ending March 2015. The rate then increased until the year ending March 2018 (11.8) before falling to around 11 in the following two years. The latest year shows a decrease to 9.9 per million population (Figure 1). \u00a0\n\n\nFigure 1: The homicide rate has decreased, following an increase the previous year\nHomicide rate, England and Wales, year ending December 1970 to year ending March 2021\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\n\nNotes:\n\nYear ending December 1987 includes 15 victims of Michael Ryan.\nYear ending March 2001 includes 58 Chinese nationals who suffocated in a lorry en route into the UK.\nYear ending March 2003 includes 173 victims of Dr Harold Shipman.\nYear ending March 2004 includes 20 cockle pickers who drowned in Morecambe Bay.\nYear ending March 2006 includes 52 victims of the 7 July London bombings.\nYear ending March 2011 includes 12 victims of Derrick Bird.\nYear ending March 2017 includes 96 victims of Hillsborough and four victims of the Westminster Bridge attack.\nYear ending March 2018 incudes 31 victims of the terrorist attacks that involved multiple victims, including the Manchester Arena bombing, and the London Bridge attack.

The number of female victims has tended to fluctuate between 180 and 250 a year from the 1960s, although there are occasional years where the number has been higher than 250. In contrast, the number of male victims increased, reaching an average of around 550 a year between year ending March 2001 and year ending March 2005 (Figure 3). After this, there was a fall in the number of male victims, which drove the downward trend in homicide during this time. In the year ending March 2015, there were 319 male victims of homicide, the lowest number in a quarter of a century.\nThe increase in homicide between the year ending March 2015 and year ending March 2018 reflected a 50% rise in the number of male victims, which increased from 319 in the year ending March 2015 to 478 in the year ending March 2018. Over the same period the number of female victims increased from 184 to 218 (18% increase).\nIn the latest year, there has been a decrease of 16% in the number of male victims (495 to 416), returning to the levels seen in the year ending March 2019. Conversely, the number of female victims stayed the same (177 victims), following a large decrease the previous year. More information is given in Section 3.\nCompared with other offences, homicides are relatively low volume, and year-on-year variations need to be interpreted with some caution. This is partly because trends can be affected by single incidents involving multiple victims (such as the Grays lorry incident in 2019 and the Manchester Arena incident in 2017). Figure 2 shows that in the year ending March 2021, there were 582 separate homicide incidents (Appendix table 2).\nA homicide incident can involve one or more victims but is only counted as one incident, while Homicide Index statistics are based on the number of victims. Therefore, homicide incident trend data are not affected by mass fatality homicides such as terrorist attacks.\n\n\nFigure 2: The number of homicide incidents has shown a slight downward trend over the past three years\nNumber of homicide incidents, England and Wales, year ending March 2001 to year ending March 2021\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 2: The number of homicide incidents has shown a slight downward trend over the past three years\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nIt is possible to assess long term trends in the number of homicide incidents using statistical significance testing. The probabilities of homicide incidents happening can be closely modelled by a Poisson distribution and this can be used to test whether any change in the number of incidents per year is statistically significant, or what can be termed within the range of expected \"natural\" variation of the data. The number of incidents recorded in the year ending March 2021 was not statistically significantly different compared with the previous year. The number of incidents seen in the last four years was statistically significantly higher than the four year period from the year ending March 2012 to the year ending March 2015 (Appendix table 3). The number of homicide incidents in the last year was statistically significantly lower than the year ending March 2008 and the early 2000s.\nFurther information on the methodology can be found in Section 11 of the Homicide chapter of Focus on violent crime and sexual offences, England and Wales: year ending March 2016.\u00a0\nDemographic factors discussed in this section are not necessarily independently related to homicide and the findings only report on differences between estimates. Although sex, age and ethnicity are important factors in homicide, there are likely to be many other factors that cannot be examined using the Homicide Index data. For example, socioeconomic indicators at the individual and neighbourhood level are also likely to be related to being a victim of homicide (further information can be found in The social patterning of deaths due to assault in Scotland, 1980-2005: population-based study.)\nAs in previous years, the majority of homicide victims were male. In the year ending March 2021, over two-thirds of all victims were male (70%) and just under a third were female (30%).\nThe number of female victims (177) was the same as last year. During the two previous years, the number of these victims were higher (218 and 219; Figure 3). The number of female victims in the last year was similar to that seen between the year ending March 2012 and the year ending March 2017 (between 167 and 184). For those female victims where a suspect had been charged, 92% (109) of those suspects were male. (Appendix table 31).\nThere is more information on homicide trends by sex in Section 2.\n\n\nFigure 3: The number of male homicide victims has decreased in the latest year while the number of female victims has remained the same.\nNumber of homicide victims, England and Wales, year ending March 2001 to year ending March 2021\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\n\nNotes:\n\nYear ending March 2003 includes 43 male and 130 female victims of Dr Harold Shipman.\nYear ending March 2017 includes 89 male and seven female victims of Hillsborough.\nYear ending March 2017 includes one female and three male victims of the Westminster Bridge attack.\nYear ending March 2018 includes 21 female and 10 male victims of terrorist attacks that involved multiple victims and 11 male victims of Shoreham air crash.\nYear ending March 2020 includes 30 male and nine female victims whose bodies were found in a lorry in Essex.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 3: The number of male homicide victims has decreased in the latest year while the number of female victims has remained the same.\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThe latest annual homicide rate for males (14 per million population) was more than double that for females (6 per million population), Appendix table 4. However, it should be noted that the nature of homicides differs between males and females, as discussed in Section 4.\nChanges in the number of homicides in certain age groups may have reflected changes in the composition of homicides given the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. \u00a0\nThe most common age group for victims of homicides recorded in the year ending March 2021 was those aged 25 to 34 years (124 victims) (Figure 4). This was followed by those aged:\n35 to 44 years (99 victims)\n16 to 24 years (94 victims)\n45 to 54 years (89 victims)\nAs in previous years, children aged under one year had the highest rate of homicide (41 per million population). This rate fluctuates from year to year because of the low number of victims in this age group. This was followed by those aged 16 to 24 years and those aged 25 to 34 years (15 per million population).\nThere were 50 homicides where the victim was a teenager (aged 13 to 19 years), a decrease of 19 (from 69). In 70% of these teen homicides, the method of killing was a knife or sharp instrument (Appendix table 8). See Section 5 for more detail on sharp instrument (including knives) homicides.\nThe overall decrease in homicide victims in the latest year was driven by a decrease in those aged 16 to 24 years, which fell from 141 to 94 (a 33% decrease), Appendix table 4. The trend in this age group has shown a high level of fluctuation over recent years, with the number of victims from the year ending March 2016 being 85, then 151, 147, 111, 141 in the following years and 94 in the latest year. \u00a0\nThose aged 35 to 44 years also saw a decrease of 23% (from 128 to 99 victims). This followed a rise in this age group in the previous year.\nThe largest percentage increase in the latest year was in the number of victims aged under 16 years, up from 43 to 59 (a 37% increase). This was driven by an increase in victims aged under five years, which rose from 28 to 44 victims. Trends for this age group tend to fluctuate from one year to the next because of the relatively low numbers (Figure 4).\n\n\nFigure 4: There was a large decrease in homicides for victims aged 16 to 24 years\nNumber of homicide victims, England and Wales, year ending March 2011 to year ending March 2021 (excluding Hillsborough victims)\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\n\nNotes:\n\nData for the year ending March 2017 do not match Appendix table 4 as Hillsborough victims are excluded from this analysis.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 4: There was a large decrease in homicides for victims aged 16 to 24 years\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nOver two-thirds (409 or 69%) of all homicide victims in the year ending March 2021 were from the White ethnic group (Officer identified ethnicity classification). This was a decrease of 16 victims (from 425) compared with the year ending March 2020.\nThere were 98 victims identified in the Black ethnic group in the last year, accounting for 16% of all victims. This was a decrease of five homicides compared with the previous year and a similar number as the year ending March 2019. There were 48 (8%) victims in the Asian (Indian sub-continent) ethnic group and 16 (3%) in the Other group. (Appendix table 5).\nAlthough the majority of homicide victims were White, accounting for different population sizes shows that Black people had higher rates of victimisation (Appendix table 6). In the three years to year ending March 2021, average rates per million population were around six times higher for Black victims than White victims and almost four times higher than victims of other ethnicities. This is based on mid-2016 population estimates. Three-year averages are used to calculate homicide rates by ethnicity because of the low numbers of victims in some groups. The Other ethnicities category reported here includes Asian and Mixed or multiple ethnicities, to enable population statistics to match the categories in the Homicide Index. As stated previously, demographic factors are not necessarily independently related to homicide. Differences in homicide rates by ethnicity are likely to be influenced by variations in demographic and socioeconomic indicators across ethnic groups. These factors have not been taken into account in these figures.\nHomicide rates across all ethnic groups over the last three years have increased compared with the three-year period to year ending March 2015. The homicide rate for Black victims has shown the biggest increase, from 28.0 to 50.5 per million population. This compares with the rate for White victims, which increased from 8.0 to 8.5 per million population. (Appendix table 6).\nThere were clear differences in the age profile of victims between different ethnic groups. Approximately a third of Black (35%) and Asian (29%) victims were aged 16 to 24 years, whereas this was a much lower proportion for White victims (10%). White victims were the most evenly spread across different age groups (Figure 5; Appendix table 5). This will partly reflect the different age distributions of ethnic groups in the population, for further information see Population estimates by ethnic group and religion, England and Wales: 2019.\n\n\nFigure 5: Over a third of Black homicide victims were aged between 16 to 24 years\nPercentage of homicide victims, by age and ethnicity, England and Wales, year ending March 2021\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\n\nNotes:\n\nOfficer identified classification\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 5: Over a third of Black homicide victims were aged between 16 to 24 years\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nAs in previous years, there were important differences between adult and child victims in their relationship with suspects. For that reason, our analysis examines patterns separately.\nThere were large differences in the profile of victim-suspect relationships between male and female victims. In the year ending March 2021, female victims were more commonly killed by a partner or ex-partner or a family member. For males the suspected killer was more commonly a friend or acquaintance, stranger or other known person.\nThere were 114 domestic homicides in the year ending March 2021, a decrease of 7 (6%) compared with the previous year, however, this is likely to increase as police investigations continue. For example, the number of domestic homicides as published last year was 114 and this has now increased to 121 as police investigations have continued. This is a similar number to the average over the last five years (121). These numbers reflect the low level of domestic homicides seen since year ending March 2017 and the general downward trend in the number of domestic homicides over the last 10 years. While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions did not lead to an increase in domestic homicides in the latest year, as may have been expected, non-domestic homicides decreased by 17% (from 508 to 420).\nOf the 114 domestic homicides, 67 victims were killed by a partner or ex-partner (down from 74), 27 were killed by a parent, son or daughter (down from 32) and 20 were killed by another family member (up from 15).\nAlmost half (49%) of adult female homicide victims were killed in a domestic homicide (75). During COVID-19 lockdown periods covering 23 March to 3 July 2020, 5 November to 2 December 2020 and 5 January to 31 March 2021, this was 56%, highlighting the change in composition of homicides during the restrictions. Of the 75 female victims, 72 were killed by a male suspect (Appendix table 31).\nMales were much less likely to be the victim of a domestic homicide, with only 10% (39) of male homicides being domestic related in the latest year, a similar proportion to the previous year.\nIn over a third of female adult victims, the suspect was their partner or ex-partner (37%, 57 homicides). This was a decrease of 7 homicides compared with the previous year, however, this is again likely to increase as police investigations continue. Over the last 10 years, there was an average of 77 female victims a year killed by a partner or ex-partner. \u00a0\nA stranger was the suspect for around a fifth of male victims (18%, 68 victims). This was a decrease of 25% (excluding the Essex lorry deaths) and a return to the levels seen in year ending March 2018 (Appendix table 13). The suspect was less likely to be a stranger when the victim was female (6%, 9 victims).\nIn 31% of female homicides recorded in the year ending March 2021, no suspect had been charged for the offence at the time of analysis (47 victims). The percentage of male victims (28%) with no suspect charged was similar (105 victims). These numbers will decrease as police continue their investigations.\n\n\nFigure 6: For the majority of female homicide victims aged 16 years and over where a suspect had been identified, that suspect was their partner or ex-partner\nRelationship of victims aged 16 years and over to principal suspect, England and Wales, year ending March 2021\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\n\nNotes:\n\nPartner or ex-partner includes boyfriend or girlfriend, common-law spouse or cohabiting partner, ex-spouse, ex-common-law spouse or ex-cohabiting partner, ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend, spouse (including civil partner), adulterous relationship.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 6: For the majority of female homicide victims aged 16 years and over where a suspect had been identified, that suspect was their partner or ex-partner\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThere were 59 victims of homicide aged under 16 years in the year ending March 2021. As in previous years, the most common suspect was a parent or step-parent (42%, 25 offences). However, as at 10 December 2021, there were 27 victims aged under 16 years (46%) for whom no suspect had been charged (this includes homicide offences where all suspects have been acquitted). This number will fall as police investigations continue. For example, for the year ending March 2020, 44% of victims aged under 16 years had no suspect charged as at 15 December 2020; this has now fallen to 35% and the proportion where the suspect was a parent or step-parent has increased from 27% to 35% (as at 10 December 2021).\nIt is very rare for those aged under 16 years to be killed by a stranger, with one such offence in the last year, similar to previous years.\nThere is more information on suspect characteristics in Section 8.\nAs in previous years, the most common method of killing, for both male and female victims, was by a sharp instrument (including knives; 40%). Since the year ending March 2011, the proportion of homicide offences committed by a sharp instrument has fluctuated between 36% and 41%, (the proportion was 37% in the year ending March 2017 if the Hillsborough manslaughters are excluded).\nThere were 235 homicides committed using a knife or other sharp instrument recorded in the year ending March 2021, a decrease of 13% compared with the previous year (Appendix table 7). This decrease may have reflected changes in the composition of homicides given the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. \u00a0\nThe decrease was driven by a 17% reduction in the number of male victims, which fell from 221 to 183. The largest decrease was seen for male victims aged 18 to 24 years, decreasing from 68 to 50 homicides. In contrast, the number of female victims killed by this method rose slightly from 48 to 52 (Appendix table 9).\nThe latest figures show over half of sharp instrument homicide victims were identified as White (60%, 140 homicides), a decrease of five compared with the previous year. Just under a quarter (24%; 57 victims) were identified as Black, a decrease of 17 compared with the previous year. Of these 57 Black homicide victims, 25 were aged 16 to 24 years (Appendix table 10).\nThere is more information on the characteristics of victims in Section 3.\nThe second most common method of killing was by \"kicking or hitting\", accounting for 107 homicides (18% of the total). As in previous years, the majority (81%) of victims killed in this way were male.\nOne in ten (10%) female victims were killed by \"strangulation, asphyxiation\" (17 victims). In contrast, a much smaller proportion (2%; 10) of male victims were killed in this way.\nThere were 35 homicide victims killed by shooting in the year ending March 2021 (6% of all homicides), five more than the previous year. The proportion of homicide offences committed by shooting has fluctuated between 4% and 8% over the last ten years. The number of these offences is 43% lower than a decade ago (61 in the year ending March 2011).\n\n\nFigure 7: Use of a sharp instrument was the most common method of killing in homicide offences\t\nPercentage of recorded homicides, England and Wales, year ending March 2021\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 7: Use of a sharp instrument was the most common method of killing in homicide offences\t\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nMore detailed information on offences involving a firearm can be found in the Offences involving the use of firearms article and Appendix tables. More recent headline figures on offences involving firearms and those involving knives can also be found as part of the quarterly Crime in England and Wales bulletin.\nIn the year ending March 2021, more than half (54%, 320 offences) of all homicide cases resulted from a quarrel, a revenge attack or a loss of temper. This was a similar proportion compared with previous years. As might be expected, this proportion was higher where the principal suspect was known to the victim (67%), compared with when the suspect was unknown to the victim (41%).\nFurtherance of theft or gain accounted for 4% of homicides (25 offences), and 6% (38 offences) occurred during irrational acts.\nAs at 10 December 2021, the apparent circumstances were not known for 19% of homicides (114 offences) recorded in the year ending March 2021. This figure was similar to the previous year and is likely to decrease as the police carry out further investigations.\nHomicides were mostly likely to take place in or around a house, dwelling or residential home. The number of victims killed in this setting has been largely consistent over the past ten years. Conversely the number of victims killed in a street, path or alleyway has been increasing since year ending March 2015, but has decreased in the latest year by 39% (from 210 to 129), which may be expected because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions in place during most of the latest year(Appendix table 17).\nFemale victims were most likely to be killed in or around a house, dwelling or residential home (81%, 143 offences for year ending March 2021). This compared with 47% of male homicides (196 offences). Around 3 in 10 (29%) male homicides took place in a street, path or alleyway (121 offences) compared with only 5% of female homicides (8 offences). These patterns reflect differing victim-suspect relationships and the circumstances of the homicide (Appendix table 17).\n\n\nFigure 8: Female homicide victims were most likely to be killed in or around a house or dwelling and male victims in public places\nPercentage of recorded homicides, England and Wales, year ending March 2021\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\n\nNotes:\n\n\u201cHouse, dwelling (in and around)\u201d includes residential homes.\n\u201cOther\u201d includes all other locations including other public places.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 8: Female homicide victims were most likely to be killed in or around a house or dwelling and male victims in public places\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThe analysis and commentary in this section focuses on data combined from the last three years (the year ending March 2019 to the year ending March 2021) because of the low number of drug- or alcohol-related homicides in each category. The section is based on all victims and suspects charged from incidents recorded in that period. Information on drug and alcohol use is recorded by the police from toxicology reports and suspect and witness statements.\nAccording to the Homicide Index, in the last three years almost a third (32%) of homicide victims were thought to be under the influence of alcohol and/or illicit drugs at the time of the homicide:\n18% had been drinking alcohol\n6% had been taking an illicit drug (which include all controlled drugs under Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971)\n8% were under the influence of both\nThe proportion under the influence of alcohol and/or illicit drugs was higher among male (37%) than female victims (22%), similar to the analysis in previous years (Appendix table 18).\nThe figures for suspects were similar to that for victims. Over a quarter (28%) of homicide suspects were recorded by the police to have been under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs at the time of the homicide:\n13% had been drinking alcohol\n5% had been taking an illicit drug\n10% were under the influence of both (Appendix table 18)\nAlmost a third (31%) of homicide victims were known to be drug users, and 15% were known to be drug dealers. These proportions were higher among suspects with 45% known to be drug users and over a quarter (29%) known to be drug dealers. These proportions were higher among male than female suspects. In a small proportion of cases, the police identified the suspects' motive as \"obtaining drugs\" (4%) or \"stealing drug proceeds\" (6%) (Appendix table 19).\nThe proportion of homicides that have involved drug users or dealers, or have been related to drugs in any way, have increased over the last decade, from 40% in the year ending March 2011 to 52% in the year ending March 2021. In the last year, there were 306 homicides that were thought to involve drug users or dealers or were in some way drug-related, 33 fewer than the previous year (339) (Appendix table 20). This fall was driven by the number of drug-related homicides that took place in a public place and therefore may be because of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions imposed in the latest year.\nHomicide cases are often complex and can take time to reach an outcome in court. The percentage of homicides recorded in most recent years that have concluded in court is likely to increase when the next figures from the Homicide Index are published, while those without suspects or with court proceedings pending is expected to decrease.\nMore than one suspect may be charged per homicide victim and in some cases no suspect is charged (Table 1). Therefore, the number of suspects charged is not the same as the number of offences. Table 1 shows that the number of homicides where no suspect has been charged falls over time as the police have had longer to conclude investigations and for cases to be tried at court. For example, for the year ending March 2020, 29% of victims had no suspect charged as at 15 December 2020; this has now fallen to 20% (as at 10 December 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Number of suspects for initially recorded homicide victims, year ending March 2019 to year ending March 2021\tNumbers and percentages as at 10 December 2021\t\n\nApr 2018 to Mar 2019Apr 2019 to Mar 2020Apr 2020 to Mar 2021Apr 2018 to Mar 2019Apr 2019 to Mar 2020Apr 2020 to Mar 2021\nNumberPercentage\nNo suspects charged138138175212029\nOne367352304575251\nTwo63616310911\nThree or more51110518169\nSuspects acquitted30226531\nAll initially recorded homicides649683599\n\nSource: Source: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\nNotes\n\nAs at 10 December 2021; figures are subject to revision as cases are dealt with by the police and the courts or as further information becomes available. \nHome Office statisticians and police forces have undertaken a review of homicide data between year ending March 2019 and year ending March 2020 to update suspect data and cancelled crimes, this means totals shown in this table will not match previously published figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload this table Table 1: Number of suspects for initially recorded homicide victims, year ending March 2019 to year ending March 2021\t\n.xls\n.csv\n\nIn total, there were 660 suspects charged as at 10 December 2021 relating to the 599 homicides initially recorded in the year ending March 2021 (Appendix table 24).\nCourt proceedings were pending for 367 suspects (56% of all suspects). Last year this proportion was 64%. During the five years prior to that this proportion has been around 50% (as at the time of publication).\nCourt proceedings had concluded for 273 suspects (41% of all suspects) and 19 had committed suicide or died (3% of all suspects).\nIn the three years from the year ending March 2019 to the year ending March 2021, 81% of suspects indicted for homicide, where we have information on a court outcome, were found guilty of homicide, 13% were acquitted, and 4% were convicted of a lesser offence (Appendix table 25).\nThe case outcomes for suspects of homicides recorded in the year ending March 2021 (Appendix table 25) will change as cases progress through the criminal justice system and more information becomes available.\nFor the three-year period year ending March 2019 to the year ending March 2021, the vast majority of suspects convicted of homicide were male (995; 94%). Four in ten convicted male suspects were aged 16 to 24 years (40%) and 27% were aged 25 to 34 years. This contrasts with female suspects convicted of homicide who had an older age profile, with over half (52%) being aged 35 years and over (Appendix table 28 and Figure 9).\n\n\nFigure 9: Male suspects convicted of homicide show a younger age profile than female suspects\t\nPercentage of convicted suspects, England and Wales, three years combined - year ending March 2019 to year ending March 2021\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Homicide Index\t\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 9: Male suspects convicted of homicide show a younger age profile than female suspects\t\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nFor the three-year period year ending March 2019 to the year ending March 2021, when looking at the principal suspect of a homicide offence, around two-thirds (68%) of those convicted of homicide were identified as White. This was a lower representation than in the general population (around 85%), based on mid-2016 population estimates. Around one in five (18%) suspects were identified as Black, five times higher than the general population (3%) (Appendix table 30). Differences in these figures are likely to be related to the ethnicity of the population differing by age, region and socioeconomic factors, which have not been taken into account.\nThere are issues surrounding the comparability of international homicide data, therefore caution should be taken in comparing homicide rates across countries.\nHomicide figures differ between countries for various reasons, including:\ndifferent definitions of homicide between countries, although definitions vary less than for some other types of crimes\ndiffering points in the criminal justice systems at which homicides are recorded, for instance, when the offence is discovered or following further investigation or court outcome\nfigures for England and Wales are for completed homicides (that is excluding attempted murder) but, in some countries, the police register any death that cannot immediately be attributed to other causes as homicide\nEurostat figures show that police recorded intentional homicide offences generally decreased across EU member states from 2008 to 2019. In 17 out of 27 countries, the intentional homicide rate decreased between 2018 and 2019.\u00a0Latvia had the highest rate of homicide in 2019 (47.4 per million population). In 19 countries the rate was below 10 per million. Iceland had the lowest rate, at 2.8 per million population. England and Wales, at 9.9 per million population in year ending March 2021, had a similar rate to many European countries.\nThe Scottish Government annual homicide figures showed that the number of homicide cases recorded by the police in Scotland decreased by ten cases in the year ending March 2021, from 65 to 55. This was the lowest number of recorded homicide cases since comparable records began in 1976. Over the ten-year period from 2011 to 2012 to 2020 to 2021, the rate of homicides in Scotland has fallen from 17.5 to 10.6 homicide victims per million population. This latest figure is similar to the rate in England and Wales (9.9 per million population).\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland figures show there were 22 homicide offences recorded by the police in Northern Ireland in the year ending March 2021 (11.6 victims per million population), one more than the previous year.\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) publish a Global study on homicide which gives a comprehensive overview of intentional homicide across the world. The most recent publication was in 2019 and showed that the global average homicide rate was 61 per million population in 2017. Central America and South America, at 259 and 242 per million population, respectively, were the subregions with the highest average homicide rates in 2017. This is excluding all the subregions of Africa, for which complete data are not available. The subregions with the lowest levels of homicide, at around 10 per million population were Southern, Western and Northern Europe, East Asia and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand).\nThe Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation published figures showing that the homicide rate in the United States of America in 2019 was 50 per million population, a similar rate to the previous year.\n\nAppendix tables: homicide in England and Wales  Dataset | Released 10 February 2022  Findings from the analyses based on the Homicide Index recorded by the Home Office, including long-term trends, sex of the victim, apparent method of killing and relationship to victim. \n\n\nData presented have been extracted from the Home Office Homicide Index which contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by police in England and Wales. The Homicide Index is continually updated with revised information from the police as investigations continue and as cases are heard by the courts. The version used for analysis does not accept updates after it is \"frozen\" to ensure the data do not change during the analysis period. The data in this article refer to the position as at 10 December 2021. The data will change as subsequent court hearings take place or as further information is received.\nHomicide Index data are based on the year when the offence was recorded as a crime, not when the offence took place or when the case was heard in court. While in the majority of cases the offence will be recorded in the same year as it took place, this is not always so. Caution is therefore needed when looking at longer-term homicide trends. For example:\nthe 96 of the 97 deaths that occurred at Hillsborough in 1989 were recorded as manslaughters in the year ending March 2017 following the verdict of the Hillsborough Inquest in April 2016\nthe 173 homicides attributed to Dr Harold Shipman as a result of Dame Janet Smith's inquiry took place over a long period of time but were all recorded by the police during the year ending March 2003\nFurthermore, where several people are killed by the same suspect, the number of homicides counted is the total number of victims killed rather than the number of incidents. For example, the 39 victims of human trafficking found in a lorry in Grays, Essex, in October 2019 are counted as 39 individual homicides.\nFor the purposes of the Homicide Index, a suspect in a homicide case is defined as either:\na person who has been charged with a homicide offence, including those who were subsequently convicted and those awaiting trial\na person who is suspected by the police of having committed the offence but is known to have died or committed suicide\nWhen the police initially record an offence as a homicide it remains classified as such unless the police or courts decide that a lesser offence, or no offence, took place. In all, 703 deaths were initially recorded as homicides by the police in the year ending March 2020. By 15 December 2020, eight were no longer recorded as homicides.\nWhere there are multiple suspects, they are categorised in the Homicide Index as either the principal or a secondary suspect. The suspect with the longest sentence or most serious conviction is determined to be the principal suspect. In the absence of any court outcome, the principal suspect is either the person considered by the police to be the most involved in the homicide or the suspect with the closest relationship to the victim.\nHomicides are recorded to be \"domestic\" when the relationship between a victim aged 16 years and over and the perpetrator falls into one of the following categories: spouse, common-law spouse, cohabiting partner, boyfriend or girlfriend, ex-spouse, ex-cohabiting partner or ex-boyfriend or girlfriend, adulterous relationship, son or daughter (including step and adopted relationships), parent (including step and adopted relationships), brother or sister, or other relatives.\nHomicides classified as irrational acts cover those offences where there is evidence that the offender was suffering substantial mental illness. These do not account for all homicides committed by mentally ill people, as offences with an apparent motive (for example, during a quarrel or robbery) are instead included under the respective circumstance. Higher overall totals for homicides committed by those suffering mental illness are quoted elsewhere (National confidential inquiry into suicide and safety in mental health).\nIn collaboration with police forces and the National Police Chiefs' Council's Homicide Working Group, Home Office statisticians have undertaken an extensive data quality exercise on suspect information and cancelled crimes for year ending March 2019 and March 2020. Information on these areas published in the tables may therefore differ from recent years, with data now being more complete.\nThe Home Office Homicide Index contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by police in England and Wales. These figures provide much more detail about the nature and circumstances of homicide offences than the main police recorded crime dataset. However, the level of detail in the Homicide Index means that these data take longer to collect and analyse than the more basic counts of recorded offences in the main recorded crime dataset. Headline figures, covering a more recent period, on the number of recorded homicides are published as part of the quarterly Crime in England and Wales bulletin.\nIn accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, statistics based on the Home Office Homicide Index have been re-assessed against the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and found to meet the required standard for designation as National Statistics. The letter of confirmation can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\nFurther information on the Homicide Index can be found in the User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales.\n", "summary": "Coronavirus lockdowns affect homicide trends\nRestrictions on social contact during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns appear to have affected the number and type of homicides in England and Wales.\nData from the Home Office\u2019s Homicide Index for the year ending March 2021 show that while there was a 16% decrease in the number of male homicide victims (495 to 416), the number of female victims was the same as last year (177).\nA headline reduction in homicides of 12% (from 515 to 594) during this period masks a change in trends in homicides committed inside and outside a domestic setting.\nWhile there was a substantial fall in the number of victims who were killed in public places compared with last year (a 27% decrease), there was a 5% increase in victims who were killed in a residential setting, which may explain the different trends between males and females.\nThere was a 17% decrease, from 508 to 420, in the number of non-domestic homicides, which are more likely to take place in a public place. The number of domestic homicides (114), which were more likely to occur in a residence, was similar to the previous year.\nDaily life was turned on its head during lockdown, with our high streets and entertainment venues empty and families staying at home for longer periods of time.\nThe homicide rate remains relatively low in England and Wales, as a proportion of the population: there were 9.9 per million of population during the year ending March 2021.

Results are based only on the responses of people interviewed, and do not account for differences in the respondent group compared with all travellers. The results should not be considered indicative of the travelling population as a whole and cannot be compared with weighted data. See section 7. \n\n\n\nIn December 2021, 9 in 10 travellers arriving in the UK had received at least two coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations (92% of UK and 89% of overseas residents). The percentage of UK residents arriving in the UK who had received more than two COVID-19 vaccinations rose from 11% in November to 28% in December 2021 (Figure 1). There was also an increase in the number of overseas residents arriving in the UK who had received more than two COVID-19 vaccinations (7% in November and 18% in December).\nThe increase in the percentage of UK residents who had received more than two vaccinations reflects the expansion of the NHS booster programme to all adults aged 18 years or over, with those eligible to have been offered a vaccination by the end of January 2022. This follows the advice given to UK health departments by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in light of the new Omicron variant.\nThe Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Passenger Survey found similar levels of vaccination to the International Passenger Survey (IPS): 98% of both UK and overseas residents interviewed departing the UK had received at least one vaccination (December 2021).\nThe UK Coronavirus dashboard, shows 90% of all UK residents had received at least one vaccination by 31 December, with 83% having received two vaccinations and 59% having received a booster or three vaccinations. In line with the vaccine rollout programme, UK residents arriving into the UK in the older age groups were more likely to have received their first vaccine earlier in the year. Proportions in these age groups reporting that they have had at least one vaccination remain stable from August but have increased in younger age groups.\nThe majority of UK residents (83% in December 2021) returning from abroad say that they found it \"easy\" or \"very easy\" to follow the coronavirus (COVID-19) restriction information for the country that they had visited (Figure 2). Of those who reported finding it \"difficult\" or \"very difficult\" to follow the COVID-19 restrictions, the proportion who said that this was because the information \"kept changing over time\" almost doubled between November and December (from 20% to 39%). This reason replaced \"I found them difficult to follow, or overly restrictive\" (23% in November and 19% in December) as the main reason for finding COVID-19 restrictions difficult to follow.\nThe majority of overseas residents arriving in the UK said they understood UK COVID-19 restrictions well and could confidently access information about the restrictions, a trend that has remained consistent since March 2021. In December 2021, 96% of overseas residents said that they understood UK restrictions \u201cquite well\u201d or \u201cvery well\u201d, and 96% that they felt \u201cvery confident\u201d or \u201csomewhat confident\u201d in accessing UK restrictions. \nOnly 3% felt not at all confident or not very confident in accessing information about the UK\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions; 38% of these respondents accessed the information themselves online.\nMost travellers arriving in the UK think that having a coronavirus (COVID-19) test prior to arrival is either \"very important\" or \"quite important\" for safety. In December 2021, 87% of UK residents and 92% of overseas residents said they thought COVID-19 testing prior to arrival is \"quite\" or \"very important\" (Figure 3).\nHowever, the proportion of travellers arriving in the UK who thought COVID-19 testing is \"very important\" fell from around three-quarters of UK residents in February 2021 (73%) to just under a half in August (45%) and has stayed consistently around half since (55% in December 2021). While the proportion of overseas residents who thought COVID-19 testing was \"very important\" also fell during this period, it has not fallen below half of all travellers interviewed. In December, 60% of overseas residents said that they thought COVID-19 testing prior to travel was \"very important\".\nTravellers continue to feel that the wearing of face coverings and the provision of hand sanitiser made them feel safe during their journey. In December 2021, four-fifths of travellers (80% of UK and 82% of overseas residents) said that the wearing of face coverings made them feel safe during their journey to the UK (Figure 4). Three-quarters of travellers said that the availability of hand sanitiser during their journey also made them feel safe (78% of UK and 77% of overseas residents).\nThe Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA's) Passenger Survey asked travellers leaving the UK whether they felt satisfied with the number of travellers wearing face coverings at the airport. In December 2021, the majority of UK (88%) and overseas (86%) residents said they were satisfied or very satisfied (Figure 5).\nIn England, on 10 December 2021, the legal requirement to wear face coverings was re-introduced for indoor settings and on public transport, having been previously removed on 19 July 2021. The legal requirement to wear face coverings was then removed on 22 January 2022. However, individual settings can require the wearing of face coverings or the use of hand sanitiser and most major UK airports and airlines have chosen to do so.\n\nAttitudes towards COVID-19 among passengers arriving into the UK Dataset | Released 9 February 2022 This dataset includes data collected from the International Passenger Survey and the Civil Aviation Authority's Passengers Survey.Results from the International Passenger Survey for the period covering February to December 2021 includes monthly figures on the attitudes of UK and overseas residents arriving in the UK towards social distancing, wearing face coverings, and COVID-19 restrictions and the proportion who had been vaccinated.

We present findings for the most recent fortnight in this section, but a longer\u00a0time series covering 15 August 2021 to 29 January 2022 is available in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19, UK dataset.\nEstimates of the likelihood of some specific characteristics affecting an individual testing positive can fluctuate from one fortnight to another, meaning that findings that were significant in one period may not necessarily be significant in another period. This may be because the effect of a characteristic is genuinely changing, or because we do not have sufficient individuals with that characteristic in a particular fortnight to exclude any differences we find being down to chance.\nOur latest data for the fortnight ending 29 January 2022 show similar conclusions to our last publication, namely:\npeople who had reported receiving first, second and third coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines (including booster vaccines) in most vaccine groups analysed were less likely to test positive than people who were not vaccinated; there was no statistical evidence that having one vaccine more than 90 days ago or a second AstraZeneca or Moderna vaccine 90 to 180 days ago affected a person's likelihood of testing positive\nthose who have previously been infected with COVID-19 continued to be less likely to test positive than those who have not\nthose who were previously infected with COVID-19 during the period when the Delta variant was most common (May to December 2021) continued to be even less likely to test positive again than those infected prior to this period\npeople who had contact with a hospital, as well as people who live with someone who had contact with a hospital, were less likely to test positive, in comparison with those living in households where no one had contact\npeople living in more-deprived areas were more likely to test positive than those living in less-deprived areas\npeople living in multiple occupancy households were more likely to test positive than people living alone\nyoung children were most likely to test positive and people aged around 40 years were also more likely to test positive than most other age groups; older people were the least likely to test positive\npeople who report regularly using lateral flow tests continued to be more likely to test positive compared with those who do not; this is likely related to those at a higher risk of infection being encouraged to take regular lateral flow tests\nIn the same fortnight:\npeople living in rural villages were less likely to test positive than those living in major urban areas\npeople aged under 70 years who live with someone aged 70 years or over were less likely to test positive than people who do not live with anyone in this older age group\nadults who live with a child aged 16 years or under were more likely to test positive than adults who do not live with a child\nethnic minorities were more likely to test positive than people of White ethnicity\nthose who travelled abroad in the last 28 days were more\u00a0likely to test positive than those who had not\npeople who are employed but not working were more likely to test positive than people who are employed and working\nthose who work outside of the home and find it difficult to socially distance at work were more likely to test positive than those who work from home\npeople working in the education sector were more likely to test positive in comparison with other working adults; this is likely because of the recent high infections among school children\nPeople who had reported receiving first, second and third coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines (including booster vaccines) in most vaccine groups analysed were less likely to test positive than people who are not vaccinated in the fortnight ending 29 January 2022. However, there was no statistical evidence in this fortnight that having one vaccine more than 90 days ago or a second AstraZeneca or Moderna vaccine 90 to 180 days ago affected a person's likelihood of testing positive. This is different to findings reported previously, which found that those who had received two vaccinations with any COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to test positive than those who were not vaccinated, regardless of time after the second dose. This change in findings for second vaccines may be because of the priority for vaccine rollout. The majority of those who received a second AstraZeneca vaccine were older, and most will now have received a third vaccine. This means that fewer people will have received a second AstraZeneca vaccine only (and no third vaccine) in this latest time period analysed. \u00a0\n.XLSX\n.XLSX\nAn additional model examines the effect of behavioural characteristics on the likelihood of testing positive, while controlling for the core demographic variables and significant other characteristics shown earlier in this section. This means that we can identify which behavioural characteristics are associated with testing positive while taking other differences between people reporting different behaviours into account.\nOur findings suggest that in the fortnight ending 29 January 2022:\npeople who had any physical contact with those aged under 18 years were more likely to test positive than people who had no physical contact with those aged under 18 years\npeople who had 1 to 10 physical contacts with 18- to 69-year-olds were more likely to test positive than people who had no physical contact with 18- to 69-year-olds\nthose who spent more time socialising with others outside their household continued to be more likely to test positive\nschool aged children who reported never wearing a face covering at school were more likely to test positive than children who reported always wearing a face covering\nschool aged children who reported not needing to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces were more likely to test positive than children who reported always wearing a face covering\nadults who reported sometimes or never wearing a face covering at work were more likely to test positive than adults who reported always wearing a face covering\n.XLSX\nThis section looks at the rate of coronavirus (COVID-19) reinfections in the UK, from 2 July 2020 to 6 February 2022.\nWe first presented results of reinfection analysis in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of reinfections of COVID-19: June 2021. The technical article provides a more detailed explanation of the methods used, some of which have since been updated. Improvements to our modelling approach apply to data published from 6 October 2021 onwards. Tables 5a to 5d in the\u00a0accompanying dataset\u00a0for this bulletin contain our updated reinfections data.\nThe analysis presented in this section includes individuals who have had at least one positive test recorded in the survey and meet our criteria for being \"at risk\" of reinfection where:\n120 days have elapsed since an individual's first positive test in the survey and their most recent test result was negative\nif 120 days have not passed since their first positive test in the survey, the individual's last positive test has been followed by four consecutive negative tests\nAn individual being classified as \"at risk\" reflects that it was possible for a test of theirs to be considered a reinfection if it turns out to be positive. The \"at-risk period\" refers to the period following the first time we could have defined a reinfection. A reinfection is therefore defined as when an \"at risk\" individual has a positive test. This analysis only includes COVID-19 Infection Survey test results, in contrast to the definition we use for previous infections in the characteristics associated with testing positive analysis presented in Section 2.\nBefore 17 May 2021, infections were likely to be compatible with Alpha or other variants. From 17 May to 19 December 2021, substantial numbers of infections compatible with the Delta variant were observed in the survey. From 20 December 2021 onwards, substantial numbers of infections compatible with the Omicron variant were observed in the survey. Therefore, to differentiate between the period when the Alpha or Delta and Omicron variants were most common, we now estimate rates of reinfection up to 19 December 2021 and from 20 December 2021 onwards separately.\nThe estimated rate of all reinfections before the Omicron variant became most common up to 19 December 2021, and after the Omicron variant became most common from 20 December 2021 onwards are presented in Table 1. There has been a large increase in reinfection rates since the Omicron variant became most common in December 2021, both for all reinfections and reinfections with a higher viral load (Cycle threshold (Ct) less than 30).\nViral load is approximated by Ct values, which are lower with a high viral load. Participant days at risk and Ct values are further defined in our\u00a0Glossary.\nThis section presents updated analysis of the risk factors associated with a coronavirus (COVID-19) reinfection identified among participants across the UK who had previously tested positive in the survey. This analysis included 29,960 participants \"at risk\" of reinfection and 1,727 reinfections identified between 2 July 2020 and 6 February 2022.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of reinfections of COVID-19: June 2021\u00a0outlines the model used to investigate how the rate of reinfection varies over time and between individuals. This model explores multiple factors including age, sex, ethnicity, Cycle threshold (Ct) value observed in the initial infection, deprivation, household size, work in patient-facing healthcare, long-term health conditions, vaccination status and the period during which an individual was at risk. For updated methodology, please refer to our technical article.\nWe define the Alpha variant period as prior to 17 May 2021, the Delta variant period as 17 May to 19 December 2021, and the Omicron variant period as 20 December 2021 onwards.\nThe risk of reinfection by characteristic is measured in terms of hazard ratios and presented in Figure 4. In addition to the variables presented in Figure 4, we also looked at the risk of reinfection during the periods when different variants became most common. Compared with the period when the Delta variant was most common, the risk of reinfection was approximately 10 times higher in the period when the Omicron variant was most common (95% confidence interval: 6 to 15 times higher).\nPeople who are unvaccinated were approximately twice as likely to be reinfected\u00a0than\u00a0people who had\u00a0their second\u00a0vaccine 14 to 89 days ago (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 2.5 times higher). People who had their second vaccine over 90 days ago were also more likely to be reinfected than people who had their second vaccine more recently from 14 to 89 days ago.\nPeople who reported symptoms within 35 days of the first positive test in their first infection were less likely to be reinfected. People were more likely to be reinfected if they had a lower viral load (higher Ct value) in their first infection; this may be because of a weaker immune response in \"milder\" primary infections.\nOlder people were less likely to be reinfected, with a 9% lower risk (95% confidence interval: 5% to 12% lower) for every additional 10 years of age.\nPeople who live in less-deprived areas were less likely to be reinfected than people living in more-deprived areas.\nHazard ratios for all characteristics included in the model and for Ct values can be found in Tables 6a and 6b in the\u00a0accompanying dataset.\n.XLSX\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19, UK Dataset | Released 16 February 2022 Characteristics of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency and Wellcome Trust.

For instance, during the second wave people in Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups were more likely to receive a positive test for COVID-19, but in the third wave people in the White British group have been most at risk. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve also found that patterns differ by age groups, especially in the third wave. Whilst case rates were lower in the Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic groups than in the White British group among people aged below 65, they were notably higher among those aged 65 or over. This may partly explain the continued elevated risk of mortality during the third wave for these groups compared to the White British group.\u201d\nVah\u00e9 Nafilyan, Senior statistician, Health Analysis and Life Events Division, Office for National Statistics.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) previously published analysis of coronavirus (COVID-19) case rates by socio-demographic characteristic for England between 1 September 2020 and 25 July 2021. In this article, we update the previous analysis to present provisional analyses of case rates by socio-demographic characteristics in England between 1 September 2020 and 10 December 2021. \nFollowing definitions outlined in the ONS COVID-19 Insights tool, we classified tests up to and including 22 May 2021 as having occurred in the second wave, with tests from 23 May 2021 to 10 December 2021 (latest data available) classified as the first part of the third wave. Estimates relating to the second wave in this article update those reported in our previous release. This is mostly because the primary care data used in the analysis is more up-to-date, thus the study population has been revised.\nThe risk of coronavirus infection is complex and involves a range of inter-related factors. In our previous analysis, we adjusted for differences in age. To understand the drivers of differences in COVID-19 case rates, in this analysis we used logistic regression models to estimate the odds of testing positive for COVID-19. We first adjusted for age and sex, and then present a fully-adjusted model which adjusts for sex, age, geography, socio-demographic characteristics (ethnicity, area deprivation, educational attainment, household tenure, and care-home residence status), and self-reported disability status and the number of pre-existing health conditions.\nWe also further extend previous work by fitting separate models for those aged under 65 years and those 65 years and over. Easing of lockdown restrictions, such as working from home and limits on social contacts, and the vaccine rollout programme may also have played a part in the changing patterns of COVID-19 case rates by socio-demographic characteristics over the course of the pandemic.\n\n!\n\nThe case rates presented in this release cover approximately 80% of the population and may therefore differ from the administrative data on COVID-19 case rates published by Public Health England and our estimates of infection from the Coronavirus Infection Survey (CIS). This is analysis of new recently collected data, and our understanding of it and its quality will improve over time. The estimates presented in this release are experimental statistics as the NHS Test and Trace data is subject to further quality assurance tests. \n\n\n\nDifferences in case rates between ethnic groups varied over time. During the second wave, age-standardised COVID-19 case rates were highest for the Bangladeshi and Pakistani groups and lowest for the Chinese group (Figure 1), with rates of 382.4 and 373.8 per 100,000 person-weeks for the Bangladeshi and Pakistani groups, respectively, compared to 90.8 for the Chinese group (see the data tables for estimated rates in full). These differences were only marginally attenuated when adjusting for geographic factors and socio-demographic characteristics. The sex and age adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the Bangladeshi ethnic group was 2.19, whereas the fully adjusted OR was 1.88 (adjusted ORs can be found in the data tables). These figures are consistent with the differences in COVID-19 mortality seen over the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. They are also consistent \u00a0with results from research monitoring populations at an increased risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection in the community\u00a0carried out by our academic partners at the University of Oxford based on the Coronavirus Infection Survey. \n\n!\n\nMass testing was not available during the first wave, so it was not possible to calculate case rates for this period. Estimates for the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic should be considered provisional because our period of analysis does not encompass all tests occurring during the third wave, which goes beyond 10 December 2021. \n\n\n\nDuring the third wave, however, case rates were highest in the White British group, at 359.7 cases per 100,000 person-weeks. Stratifying the analyses by broad age group (those under 65 years compared with people aged 65 years and over) gives results that may partially explain the continued higher rates of mortality among ethnic minority groups seen in the third wave. Notably, among people aged under 65 years, all ethnic minority groups had lower odds of testing positive than the White British group. Conversely, during the third wave (up to 10 December 2021) among people aged 65 years or over, the fully adjusted odds of testing positive were notably higher for the Bangladeshi (OR 1.63), Pakistani (OR 1.35) and Indian (OR 1.32) ethnic groups.\nFor religious affiliation, during the second wave of the pandemic, case rates per 100,000 person-weeks were highest for people who identified as Muslim (334.9) and Sikh (321.6). The age and sex fully adjusted OR compared with the Christian population was 1.87 for the Sikh group and 1.82 for the Muslim group, with further adjustments only accounting for 15% and 29% of the excess risk, respectively.\nDuring the third wave, those who identified as Christian had the highest rates at 353.8 cases per 100,000 person-weeks, whereas the lowest rates were found in the Buddhist and Muslim groups at 221.4 and 226.7 cases per 100,000 person-weeks, respectively. The fully adjusted odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were highest among those identifying as Christian; the lowest OR was observed in the Muslim population at 0.63.\nDuring the third wave, the adjusted odds of testing positive were lower than the Christian group for all other religions among people aged under 65 years but were higher among people aged 65 years or over in the fully adjusted models for people identifying as Sikh, Hindu, Muslim, or Jewish.\nDuring the second wave, overall case rates were higher for people born outside of the UK than those born in the UK, at 203.1 cases per 100,000 person-weeks compared to 171.7 cases. However, during the third wave, rates were higher among those born in the UK (345.0 compared with 238.2 for non-UK born). In the fully adjusted model, those born outside of the UK have odds ratios relative to those born in the UK of 1.19 during the second wave and 0.79 during the third wave.\nDuring the second wave, COVID-19 case rates were highest among people living in households where the household reference person was in a semi-routine or routine occupation, at 197.1 and 192.5 cases per 100,000 person-weeks, respectively, whereas case rates were lowest among people where the household reference person was in a higher managerial occupation (140.6 cases per 100,000 person-weeks). During the third wave, however, rates were highest among people where the household reference person was in a lower or higher; managerial, administrative or professional occupation (356.5 and 346.9 cases per 100,000 person-weeks respectively) and lowest among people where the household reference person had never worked or were long-term unemployed (254.3 cases per 100,000 person-weeks). We also find that during the second wave, COVID-19 case rates were highest in the most deprived areas, as measured by the Index of Multiple Deprivation, whilst rates were highest in the least deprived areas in the third wave (see the data tables). This is consistent with other data sources. \nDuring the second wave, rates were highest in major or minor conurbations and lowest in villages, hamlets and isolated dwellings with case rates of 215.0 and 118.8 cases per 100,000 person-weeks, respectively. During the third wave, however, rates were lowest in major or minor conurbations (308.7), while the highest rates were seen in towns and fringes (360.1). After adjusting for age and sex only, the odds ratio (OR) for major or minor conurbations relative to villages, hamlets and isolated dwellings during the third wave was 0.94, while the fully adjusted models gives an OR of 1.12, suggesting the reduced relative rates can be explained by socio-economic and health factors. Recent research based on Coronavirus Infection Survey (CIS) data found that rural-urban classification was consistently associated with the risk of infection in the second and third wave. In line with Public Health England, we find substantial variation in case rates across regions, especially in the third wave (see reference Table 9). \nOver the whole analysis period and across the second and third waves of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, COVID-19 case rates were highest among non-disabled people and lowest for disabled people who were \u201climited a lot\u201d in their day-to-day activities. During the second wave, rates per 100,000 person-weeks for the non-disabled, disabled and \u201climited a little\u201d, and disabled and \u201climited a lot\u201d groups were 174.0, 162.9, and 159.9, respectively. During the third wave, differences between the groups were much larger, with rates being 337.6, 272.0, and 212.6, respectively. Several factors may contribute to these differences. Firstly, as disabled people have a greater risk of death involving COVID-19 than non-disabled people, they may have been more likely to shield and follow social distancing guidance. Secondly, disabled people have also been vaccinated more rapidly than non-disabled people, which could explain the lower case rates compared to non-disabled people in the third wave.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) case rates by socio-demographic characteristics, England Dataset| Released 14 February 2022 Analysis of age-standardised case rates of coronavirus (COVID-19) in England by socio-demographic characteristics.\n", "summary": "COVID-19 case rates highest for the White British ethnic group during the third wave\nThe socio-demographic groups at highest risk of infection have changed over the course of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nAfter adjusting for personal characteristics, the case rate was highest in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups during the second wave (1 September 2020 to 22 May 2021), but it has been highest in the White British ethnic group since the start of the third wave (23 May 2021).\nHowever, these patterns differ by age groups, particularly in the third wave.\nWhile case rates were lower in the Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic groups than in the White British ethnic group among people aged below 65 years, it was higher among people aged 65 years and over.

It is estimated that the teaching and education sector may have passed its early January 2022 peak. \nDuring the peak in early January 2022, the social care sector had the highest rate of self-isolation, with an estimated 4.5% (95% confidence interval 3.7% to 5.5%) in self-isolation. \nWe provide self-isolation estimates by country for the working-age population in this section because of smaller sample sizes for some work sectors within each nation. These estimates include working-age adults (aged 17 to 69 years) regardless of employment status. \nThe estimated percentage of the working-age population self-isolating because of coronavirus (COVID-19) increased throughout December, peaking between 1 and 3 January 2022 in all UK countries. Following the peak, self-isolation rates declined across all countries in the first two weeks of January, before beginning to level out and show possible signs of another increase in the latest two-week period (figure 2).\nIn England, the percentage of the working-age population self-isolating because of COVID-19 increased in the two weeks ending 29 January 2022. An estimated 2.2% (95% credible interval 2.0% to 2.3%) of the working-age population were in self-isolation on 15 January 2022, compared with 2.7% (95% credible interval 2.4% to 2.9%) on 29 January 2022. \nIn Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of the working-age population self-isolating because of COVID-19 showed some possible signs of an increase in the two weeks ending 29 January 2022 but with high uncertainty. \nEstimated percentage of the working-age population (aged 17 to 69 years) self-isolating because of coronavirus (COVID-19) from 12 December 2021 to 29 January 2022, UK countries \nWorking from home is allowed within the self-isolation requirements but is not possible for all workers. The ability to work from home varies by occupation, meaning the impact of self-isolation will be different in different work sectors. \nPrevious Office for National Statistics research has found that those in elementary occupations (including cleaners, waiting staff and security guards) are least likely to be able to work from home, together with process, plant and machine operatives. Front line workers were also among those least likely to be able to work from home. These include police officers, paramedics, and firefighters.

We use the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) linked to national testing and vaccination data (see Section 6 for further information). Provisional death registrations up until 25 January 2022 have been used to identify deaths involving COVID-19, which refers to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether as an underlying cause or not.\nThe study population included 1,035,163 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in December 2021 in England. It covers 36.7% of all positive tests in December 2021. In the study population, 78.6% had Omicron-compatible infections and 21.4% Delta-compatible.\nThere were 128 deaths involving COVID-19 and 53 deaths not involving COVID-19 in those infected with Omicron, and 189 and 28, respectively, in those infected with Delta. The mean time from positive result to death involving COVID-19 was 13 days for Omicron and 16 days for Delta (see the accompanying dataset for more information on the study population).\nWe use Cox proportional hazards regression models to measure the risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) following infection by the Omicron variant compared with the Delta variant. \nThe risk of death involving COVID-19 was estimated to be 67% lower (hazard ratio: 0.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.24 to 0.45) following Omicron infection relative to Delta. This was after adjusting for sex, age, vaccination status, previous COVID-19 infection, calendar time, ethnicity, Index of Multiple Deprivation rank, household deprivation, university degree, keyworker status, country of birth, main language, region, disability, and the number of pre-existing conditions. \nWe also assessed if the difference in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between Omicron and Delta variants varied by age and sex. The risk of death varied by age, with those aged under 70 years (Aged 18-59 years: hazard ratio: 0.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.06 to 0.30; Aged 60-69 years: hazard ratio: 0.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.36) having a greater reduction in the risk of COVID-19 death with Omicron compared with Delta than individuals aged 70 years and over (hazard ratio: 0.45, 95% confidence interval: 0.16 to 1.24).\nWe also show that the reduction in the risk of death involving COVID-19 following Omicron relative to Delta is significantly greater in males (hazard ratio: 0.25, 95% confidence interval: 0.17 to 0.37) than females (hazard ratio: 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.28 to 0.68).\nThere was no evidence that the relative risk of death involving COVID-19 varied for Omicron relative to Delta given the number of pre-existing health conditions (see the accompanying dataset). \nOur results based on death registration data are consistent with another study investigating the difference in the risk of hospital admissions or deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test between Omicron and Delta variants.\n\nRisk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) by variant, England: December 2021 Dataset | Released 24 February 2022 Analysis comparing the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19) death in people infected by Omicron and Delta variants, after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, vaccination status and health conditions. \n\n\nOur analysis is based on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Public Health Data Asset (PHDA), linked to national testing data taken in the community from NHS Test and Trace (pillar 2). The Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) is a linked dataset combining the 2011 Census, the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) data for coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic planning and research, the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), death registration data and COVID-19 vaccination data from the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS). The data were restricted to PCR positive tests taken in England between 1 and 31 December 2021 in the community and analysed by Lighthouse laboratories.\nProvisional death registrations up until 25 January 2022 have been used to identify deaths involving COVID-19, which refers to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate.\nThe COVID-19 variant was ascertained using S-gene target failure (SGTF). Tests were identified Omicron-compatible if S-negative, N-positive, ORF1ab-positive (with mean Ct less than 30) or Delta-compatible if S-positive, N-positive, ORF1ab-positive or ORF1ab-positive, S-positive or N-positive, S-positive, and mean Ct less than 30. \nWe used cause-specific Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate the hazard ratio of COVID-19 related death for individuals infected with Omicron versus Delta variants. For non-COVID-19 deaths, individuals were censored at the date of death if this occurred before the end of the study date. We adjusted for sex, age, vaccination status, previous COVID-19 infection, calendar time, ethnicity, Index of Multiple Deprivation rank, household deprivation, university degree, keyworker status, country of birth, main language, region, disability, and the number of pre-existing conditions (as defined in the Qcovid 3 risk model). To test whether the relative risk of mortality of Omicron varied by specific characteristics, we included interactions between variant type and age, and variant type and sex. In addition, we fitted separate fully adjusted models for those aged 18 to 59 years, those aged 60 to 69 years, and those aged 70 years and over to look at interactions between variant and the number of health conditions (zero, one to two, or three and more).\nWe used a large sample of positive cases from the national testing programme, allowing to precisely estimate the relative risk of COVID-19 death following infection with Omicron and Delta variants. We used death certificate data to confirm COVID-19 mortality, preventing our sample being conflated with non-COVID-19 related deaths of individuals that die of other causes following a positive COVID-19 test. We also compared the outcomes during the same time period overcoming any differences because of changes in management of infected patients over the time period of the pandemic. We also adjusted for a wide range of potential confounding factors.\nProvisional death registrations and death occurrences data are used in this article. This enables timely analysis to be completed to monitor mortality trends. However, as the data for 2021 are provisional, they are subject to change. This article uses death occurrences registered up to 25 January 2022. Because of registration delays, more deaths may be registered at later dates, leading to an increase in the death occurrences. This is especially true for more recent deaths. The data are for England only, as vaccinations data for Wales are not yet available and the Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) covers England only.\nImportantly, our results indicate that the risk of a death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) following infection with Omicron relative to Delta is significantly lower, however mortality is only one metric to measure the impact of infection. Subsequent work will investigate long-term outcomes of infection, such as the prevalence of long COVID following Omicron infection.\n", "summary": "Risk of death involving COVID-19 lower following Omicron infection\nThe risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) is 67% lower following an Omicron variant infection compared with the Delta variant.\nThis is an estimate based on data from COVID-19 infections in England in December 2021, adjusting for differences including vaccination status, age, sex, and previous infections.\nThe difference in risk of death involving COVID-19 between Omicron and Delta varied by age and sex.

Of those, 6.3% experienced ongoing symptoms for 12 or more weeks.\nAmong those pupils who had experienced ongoing symptoms, nearly half (49.2%) of primary school-aged pupils were reported as having their emotional well-being \"affected a little\" or \"a lot\" by their symptoms. Over a third (37.1%) were reported as having their ability to stay physically active affected and just over a third (34.0%) as having their ability to learn affected.

Further breakdowns are available in our accompanying dataset.\nWe found 13.8% of pupils of secondary school age (11 to 18 years) had a probable mental disorder, this was significantly higher for girls (18.9%) than boys (8.8%). A further 12.0% of pupils had a possible mental disorder. Probable hyperactivity disorders had the highest prevalence (9.4%), significantly higher than probable emotional disorder prevalence (4.1%) and probable conduct disorder prevalence (1.9%). Significantly more secondary school pupils eligible for free school meals had a probable mental health disorder compared with those who were not eligible (28.3% compared with 12.4%).\n\n!\n\nThis analysis does not account for mental health status before having COVID-19, thus causality cannot be inferred. \n\n\n\nFor primary school pupils, 11.1% of those who received a positive COVID-19 test had a probable mental disorder and 7.2% of those who hadn't received a positive test had a probable mental disorder.

This means the results are based on the responses of only the people interviewed, and do not account for any differences in the respondent group compared with all people travelling during the period. Therefore, the results should not be considered indicative of the travelling population as a whole and cannot be compared with weighted data. See Section 8. \n\n\n\nIn January 2022, nine in ten travellers arriving in the UK had received at least two coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations (98% of UK and 96% of overseas residents). More than half (56%) of UK residents arriving in the UK had received more than two COVID-19 vaccinations (Figure 1). This proportion doubled between December 2021 and January 2022 (rising from 28% in December 2021). The proportion of overseas residents arriving in the UK who had received more than two COVID-19 vaccinations also doubled between December 2021 and January 2022 (18% and 38%, respectively). \nThe increase in the percentage of UK residents who had received more than two vaccinations reflects the expansion of the NHS booster programme to all adults aged over 18 years; all those eligible were offered a vaccination by the end of January 2022. This follows the advice given to UK health departments by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) because of the new Omicron variant.\nThe UK Coronavirus dashboard shows that 91% of all UK residents had received at least one vaccination by 31 January 2022, with 84% having received two vaccinations and 65% having received a booster or three vaccinations. In line with the vaccine rollout programme, UK residents arriving in the UK in older age groups were more likely to have received their first vaccine earlier in the year. Proportions reporting that they have had at least one vaccination have remained stable among these older age groups from August 2021 but have increased in younger age groups. \nMost UK residents (83% in January 2022) returning from abroad said that they find it \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201cvery easy\u201d to follow the coronavirus (COVID-19) restriction information for the country that they had visited (Figure 2).

In January 2022, four-fifths of travellers (78% of UK and 81% of overseas residents) said that the wearing of face coverings made them feel safe during their journey into the UK (Figure 4). Three-quarters of travellers said that the availability of hand sanitiser during their journey also made them feel safe (75% of UK and overseas residents).\nIn England, on 10 December 2021, the legal requirement to wear face coverings was re-introduced for indoor settings and on public transport, having been previously removed on 19 July 2021. The legal requirement to wear face coverings was then removed on 22 January 2022.

The average for 2015 to 2019 has been used as this provides a comparison of the number of deaths expected in a usual (non-pandemic) year. \n\n\n\nThe total number of excess deaths, due to all causes, registered in England and Wales between March 2020 and December 2021 was 133,623. Of these, 81,885 were males (a 17.3% increase) and 51,737 were females (a 10.6% increase). Coronavirus (COVID-19) accounted for many of these deaths. Once deaths where the underlying cause of death was COVID-19 were removed, deaths were 7,401 below average (4,150 excess deaths for males, a 0.9% increase, and 11,552 fewer deaths for females, a 2.4% decrease).\nOnce deaths where there was any mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate were removed (including deaths where there was a different underlying cause of death), deaths were 25,837 below average. Although the overall number of deaths was below average once deaths due to and involving COVID-19 were removed, this trend was not consistent and varied by month. Once deaths involving COVID-19 were removed, the month with the highest number of deaths below average was January 2021 (14,037 fewer deaths). In contrast, the month with the highest number of excess deaths was April 2020 (12,859 excess deaths).\nFrom March 2020 to December 2021, the number of deaths due to all causes in England and Wales was above the five-year average in 19 of the 22 months (Figure 1), with August 2020, April 2021 and May 2021 the only exceptions. When deaths due to COVID-19 were subtracted from the total number of excess deaths, the number of deaths remained above the five-year average in 9 of the 22 months; six of which were consecutive (July 2021 to December 2021).\nThe months with the highest number of total excess deaths were April 2020 (43,796 excess deaths, a 98.8% increase) and January 2021 (16,548 excess deaths, a 29.2% increase). These were also the months in which the highest numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 were registered (29,435 and 27,488 deaths respectively). The number of deaths due to COVID-19 during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic may have been higher because of the limited availability of testing. Data on daily testing capacity in the UK is available.\nThe trend also shows that excess deaths were at their highest in the winter months, when the highest number of deaths are usually expected, and at their lowest in the summer months. The months that saw the highest numbers of excess deaths were generally followed by the months that saw the lowest, which could be evidence of mortality displacement.\nMortality displacement is a phenomenon by which a period of high mortality can be followed by below-average mortality. It occurs when vulnerable people, such as older people and those who already had medical conditions, die sooner than expected. Therefore, these individuals are not dying in the following days, weeks, or months, where they would likely have died, potentially leading to a lower-than-average period of mortality.\nWhen deaths due to COVID-19 were subtracted from the analysis, April 2020 remained the month with the highest number of excess deaths (14,361 excess deaths, a 32.4% increase on the five-year average for deaths due to all causes). Conversely, January 2021 was the month with the largest number of deaths below the five-year average when deaths due to COVID-19 were subtracted (10,940 fewer deaths, a 19.3% decrease).\nThis shows that the relationship between non-COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 mortality has changed over the course of the pandemic. Whereas in April 2020, non-COVID-19 excess mortality correlated positively with COVID-19 mortality, the opposite was the case for January 2021. This could be an indication of mortality displacement. For more information relating to mortality displacement, please see Excess mortality and mortality displacement in England and Wales: 2020 to mid-2021.\nDeaths due to causes other than COVID-19 were above average in each month between July to December 2021. Thus, the remainder of Section 3 discusses this period specifically. There were 32,575 excess deaths in this period, and when deaths due to COVID-19 were subtracted from the total number of deaths, the number of deaths remained 16,796 above average.\nThe overall leading cause of excess mortality during this period was Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions (often linked to old age and frailty), with an excess of 2,289 deaths, a 37.0% increase. This excess was driven by those aged 80 years and over, a group which saw 2,381 excess deaths due to this cause, representing an increase of 43.4%. Within this age group, the excess was largely accounted for by females, who saw 1,640 of the total excess deaths (a 39.6% increase), compared with 741 for males (a 55.3% increase). This could be because of the higher proportion of females in the older population.\nWhereas Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions was the leading cause of excess mortality for females, for males the leading cause of excess mortality was Ischaemic heart diseases, with an excess of 1,908 deaths (an increase of 11.4%). This excess was spread across age groups, with 100 excess deaths among those aged 35 to 49 years (an 18.8% increase), 623 among those aged 50 to 64 years (a 23.3% increase), and 995 among those aged 65 to 79 years (a 16.1% increase).\nDeaths due to Chronic lower respiratory diseases saw notable excesses, an underlying cause which, earlier in the pandemic, saw numbers of deaths below the five-year average. This cause was the fifth leading cause of excess mortality in July to December 2021. Within this period, it was the second leading cause of excess mortality among those aged 65 to 79 years (717 excess deaths, a 13.2% increase). This was perhaps driven by this being the leading cause of excess death for females in this age bracket (461 excess deaths, a 17.9% increase).\nFor younger age groups, deaths due to External causes of morbidity and mortality saw notable excesses. These deaths can be subject to registration delays as they are often referred to a coroner and therefore may have been registered during this period but occurred before. In 2020, deaths from external causes registered within one week remained at a low of 9.9%. 28.9% had a registration delay of between three and six months, 26.3% took between six months and one year, and 9.8% took over one year to be registered. More information can be found in our Impact of registrations delays bulletin.\nFor those aged 1 to 19 years, the leading cause of excess mortality was Suicide and injury or poisoning of undetermined intent (12 excess deaths, a 12.0% increase), followed by Accidental poisoning (seven excess deaths, a 31.8% increase), and Homicide and probable homicide (seven excess deaths, an 18.4% increase). These excesses were driven by males, who saw respective excesses in these causes of 13, 11 and 8 deaths, representing respective increases of 19.1%, 68.8%, and 30.8%. It is important to treat these findings with caution because of low numbers.\nIn early 2022 deaths have been below the five-year average (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021) in most weeks, up to week 10 (week ending 11 March 2022). The same is also true when comparing to the 2015 to 2019 five-year average. We will continue to monitor this trend over the coming weeks in our Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional bulletin.\nFrom March 2020 to December 2021, the number of deaths in England and Wales was above the five-year average in 14 out of 20 five-year age groups. When deaths due to coronavirus (COVID-19) were subtracted, the number of deaths remained above the five-year average in eight of these age groups.\nThe age group with the highest number of excess deaths that were not due to COVID-19 was those aged 70 to 74 years with 4,059 excess deaths, an increase of 4.4% on the five-year average. As a proportion, the age group with the largest excess was those aged 35 to 39 years with a 9.0% increase (571 excess deaths).\nDeaths due to all causes except COVID-19 were below the five-year average in each of the seven youngest age groups (aged 29 years and under). Of these, the age groups with the largest number of deaths below the five-year average were those aged under one year, (404 fewer deaths, an 8.3% decrease) and those aged 20 to 24 years (198 fewer deaths, an 8.1% decrease). As a percentage, the age group with the largest decrease compared with the five-year average were those aged one to four years (22.7%, 169 fewer deaths) followed by those aged five to nine years (19.0%, 90 fewer deaths).\nDeaths due to all causes except COVID-19 were also below the five-year average in the three oldest age groups (those aged 80 to 84 years, 85 to 89 years, and 90 years and over: 4,262, 8,543, and 3,037 fewer deaths respectively). These were also the age groups in which deaths due to COVID-19 were the highest (24,987, 27,106, and 29,794 deaths respectively). This could be evidence that, in the age groups most vulnerable to deaths due to COVID-19, deaths may have been subject to mortality displacement.\nThe three oldest age groups were also those that saw the largest differences in excess deaths due to causes other than COVID-19 when comparing March to December 2020 and January to December 2021. In those aged 90 years and over there was an excess of 2,200 deaths (a 2.4% increase) due to causes other than COVID-19 from March to December 2020, followed by 5,237 deaths below average in 2021 (a 4.6% decrease). It is possible that deaths being below average in 2021 was because of the high numbers of deaths due to causes other than COVID-19 in 2020. It could also be the case that high levels of COVID-19 mortality in 2020 displaced many of the deaths that would have normally been expected to occur because of other causes in this age group in 2021.\nDifferences were also observed when comparing data for England and Wales separately. The age group with the largest percentage difference in excess deaths between England and Wales was those aged 25 to 29 years. This age group saw a decrease in deaths due to causes other than COVID-19 of 2.8% in England, and a 22.6% decrease in Wales, representing a 19.8% difference. This was followed by those aged five to nine years, in which a 16.9% decrease was seen in England compared with 30.8% in Wales, representing a difference of 13.9%.\nThis section refers to excess deaths by chapter of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The ICD-10 chapter categorisation which had the highest number of excess deaths in England and Wales, from March 2020 to December 2021, was Diseases of the nervous system with 12,297 excess deaths (a 20.9% increase). The excess in this cause grouping was driven largely by deaths due to Parkinson disease (2,334 excess deaths, a 21.6% increase) and Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (573 excess deaths, a 0.5% increase).\nFor males, Diseases of the circulatory system had the highest number of excess deaths (5,245 deaths, a 4.2% increase), with the largest excess seen in deaths due to Ischaemic heart diseases. For females, Diseases of the nervous system had the highest excess (7,500 deaths, a 22.6% increase), with the largest excess seen in deaths due to Parkinson disease.\nDeaths due to Diseases of the digestive system had 4,684 excess deaths (a 10.1% increase). The excess in this cause grouping was driven largely by an excess in deaths due to Cirrhosis and other diseases of liver (3,061 excess deaths, a 20.4% increase).\nExternal causes of morbidity and mortality displayed contrasting trends. For instance, whereas deaths due to Accidental poisoning had 1,143 excess deaths (an 18.0% increase), Land transport accidents saw numbers of deaths below the five-year average (834 fewer deaths, a 28.8% decrease). This could be because of the impact of restrictions on social contact during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Also, deaths due to external causes can be subject to registration delays as they are often referred to a coroner and therefore may have been registered during this period but occurred before. More information can be found in our Impact of registrations delays bulletin.\nThe ICD-10 chapter categorisation which had the largest decrease in deaths was Diseases of the respiratory system with 28,755 fewer deaths (a 22.1% decrease), COVID-19 is not included in this chapter. This could also have been because of restrictions on social contact during the pandemic, and the consequent stemming of transmission of such diseases. It remains possible, however, that deaths due to COVID-19 have also displaced some of the deaths due to diseases of the respiratory system that we would expect in a non-pandemic year. Further investigation is required to understand this.\nThe leading underlying causes of death are based on a list developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This categorises causes using the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10), specially designed for determining the leading causes of death. More information about leading causes of death is available in our Leading causes of death methodology.\nFrom March 2020 to December 2021, the leading cause of death with the highest number of excess deaths in England and Wales was Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions (often linked to old age and frailty) with an excess of 7,085 deaths (a 30.6% increase). The excess for this cause was driven by those aged 80 years and above, in which 7,123 excess deaths were registered (an increase of 34.4% on the five-year average for this age group). This was also the leading cause of excess deaths for both males and females among those aged 80 years and over.\nCirrhosis and other diseases of liver had the second largest number of excess deaths within the same period, with 3,061 more deaths (a 20.4% increase). Of these excess deaths, 1,739 were males (an 18.8% increase) and 1,322 were females (a 22.9% increase). This excess was driven by Cirrhosis and other diseases of liver being among the top five leading causes of death with the highest number of excess deaths, in all age groups for those aged between 20 and 79 years.\nDiabetes also saw an excess of 2,696 deaths, representing a 24.7% increase compared with the five-year average. This excess was driven by Diabetes being among the top five leading causes of death with the highest number of excess deaths in those aged 20 to 34 years and all other age groups aged 50 years and over.\nThe leading cause of death with the highest percentage of excess deaths was Chronic rheumatic heart diseases with an increase of 33.5% (478 excess deaths). Males saw an increase of 39.0% (193 excess deaths) while females saw an increase of 30.5% (284 excess deaths).\nThe leading causes of death where the numbers of deaths were below the five-year average were Influenza and pneumonia (18,133 fewer deaths, a 37.1% decrease) and Chronic lower respiratory diseases (8,345 fewer deaths, a 14.9% decrease). Both causes are categorised as Diseases of the respiratory system, the cause grouping with the largest decrease in deaths compared with the five-year average between March 2020 and December 2021.\nThere is further evidence of mortality displacement in the analysis of excess deaths by underlying cause when comparing the period March to December 2020 with January to December 2021. Though most causes of death saw similar proportions of excess deaths across these two periods, deaths due to Dementia and Alzheimer's disease displayed a notably different trend. From March to December 2020, there was an excess of 4,990 deaths due to these causes, representing an increase of 9.7%. In contrast, in 2021, deaths due to these causes were 4,417 below average, representing a 6.7% decrease.\nMalignant neoplasms of the prostate, though with smaller numbers of deaths, showed a similar trend, with an excess of 352 deaths from March to December 2020 (a 4.0% increase), followed by 312 deaths below average in 2021 (a 2.9% decrease). Though further investigation is required to understand this, it offers cautious evidence that the indirect effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may have accelerated mortality in certain causes of death, thereby causing deaths to be below average later in the pandemic, an example of mortality displacement.\nFrom March 2020 to December 2021, in England and Wales, the place of occurrence with the highest number of excess deaths due to causes other than coronavirus (COVID-19) was private homes with a 75,668 excess (a 33.3% increase).\nLeading causes of death that saw a marked excess of deaths in private homes included Ischaemic heart diseases (8,095 excess deaths, a 20.2% increase), Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (7,836 excess deaths, a 71.4% increase), and numerous Malignant neoplasms, including of the trachea, bronchus, and lung (5,033 excess deaths, a 27.7% increase), and of the colon, sigmoid, rectum, and anus (3,362 excess deaths, a 36.8% increase). More information is available in our Deaths registered in private homes release.\nThere is evidence that deaths due to causes other than COVID-19 usually expected to have occurred in hospitals were transposed to other places of occurrence, particularly private homes. Hospitals saw 74,183 fewer deaths due to causes other than COVID-19 between March 2020 and December 2021, which was a 16.6% decrease on the five-year average.\nThough this was driven in part by fewer deaths due to Influenza and pneumonia (13,810 deaths below average, a 38.9% decrease). There was also fewer deaths due to Ischaemic heart diseases (9,253 fewer deaths, a 19.4% decrease) and Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (9,046 fewer deaths, a 31.3% decrease), the same two causes of death that saw the largest increases in deaths in private homes.\nThere is evidence of the same pattern for deaths occurring in hospices, which saw 10,037 deaths below the five-year average (an 18.3% decrease) due to causes other than COVID-19 over the period studied. Most of this decrease was accounted for by deaths due to several Malignant neoplasms, particularly of the trachea, bronchus, and lung (2,321 fewer deaths, a 27.4% decrease), of the colon, sigmoid, rectum, and anus (1,015 fewer deaths, an 18.7% decrease), of the breast (838 fewer deaths, a 23.6% decrease), and of the prostate (734 fewer deaths, a 28.2% decrease). Deaths occurring in private homes increased for all of these causes.\nBetween March 2020 and December 2021, for deaths due to causes other than COVID-19, care homes saw 4,531 fewer deaths compared with the five-year average, representing a decrease of 2.2%.\nWhen comparing the trend in excess mortality due to causes other than COVID-19 between the period March to December 2020 and January to December 2021, we see evidence of mortality displacement in care homes. From March to December 2020, 7,341 excess deaths were recorded in care homes, followed by 11,872 deaths below average in 2021. Though further investigation is required, it could therefore be the case that the excess mortality observed from March to December 2020 has displaced some of the mortality that would be expected to occur in 2021.\nFrom March 2020 to December 2021, there were 127,516 excess deaths in England (a 14.2% increase) and 6,864 excess deaths in Wales (a 11.4% increase). When deaths due to coronavirus (COVID-19) were subtracted, there were 5,250 deaths below the five-year average in England (a 0.6% decrease) and 1,164 fewer deaths in Wales (a 1.9% decrease).\nFor deaths due to causes other than COVID-19, three of the nine English regions saw an increase on the five-year average. These were the West Midlands (1,134 excess deaths, a 1.1% increase), East Midlands (409 excess deaths, a 0.5% increase), and the South West (165 excess deaths, a 0.2% increase). The other six regions saw a decrease, the most notable being in London (1,624 fewer deaths, a 1.8% decrease), East of England (1,558 fewer deaths, a 1.5% decrease), and the South East (1,105 fewer deaths, a 0.8% decrease).\nThe local authority with the highest proportion of excess deaths due to causes other than COVID-19 was Warwick with an 11.5% increase on the five-year average for deaths due to all causes (249 excess deaths). This was followed by Melton with a 10.3% increase (89 excess deaths), and Harborough with a 10.1% increase (149 excess deaths). The greatest proportion of deaths below the five-year average was observed in Three Rivers with a 15.9% decrease (232 fewer deaths), followed by Dartford with a 10.7% decrease (174 fewer deaths), and Watford with a 9.1% decrease (120 fewer deaths).\nThere is evidence of a small divide between urban and rural areas in excess mortality due to causes other than COVID-19. Overall, areas classified by the 2011 census Rural Urban Classification as \"Rural\" saw an excess of 1,518 deaths compared with the five-year average for deaths due to all causes (a 0.8% increase). Areas classified as \"Urban\" saw a 1.0% decrease (7,933 fewer deaths).\nPlease see the accompanying datasets for more data on geographical breakdowns.\nFor deaths due to causes other than COVID-19 in England from March 2020 to December 2021, two of the ten Index of Multiple Deprivation deciles saw an increase compared with the five-year average for deaths due to all causes. These were the two least deprived deciles of the ten; the tenth decile saw an excess of 1,403 deaths (a 1.8% increase) and the ninth decile saw an excess of 798 deaths (a 0.9% increase).\nIn Wales, the number of deaths due to causes other than COVID-19 was below average in every quintile. The number of deaths in the least deprived quintile (quintile 5) was the closest to the five-year average with four deaths below average. The second most deprived quintile (quintile 2) had the largest decrease compared with the five-year average (352 deaths below).\n\nExcess deaths in England and Wales: March 2020 to December 2021 Dataset | Released 22 March 2022 Number of excess deaths, including deaths due to COVID-19 and due to other causes.

Alongside data from the NRM, other data sources show:\nan increase of 27% (to 3,239) in the number of modern slavery offences involving a child victim recorded by the police in England and Wales in the year ending March 2021 compared with the previous year\n16,830 episodes of need for child sexual exploitation and 2,710 for trafficking identified by the Department for Education\u2019s children in need census in the year ending March 2021, both representing a 10% decrease from the previous year; likely the result of a fall in referrals from schools during the pandemic\na 43% decrease in the number of potential child victims reported to the Modern Slavery and Exploitation Helpline in the year ending December 2021 compared with the previous year\nBetween April 2016 and March 2021, the Crown Prosecution Service completed 185 modern slavery-related prosecutions involving a child victim in England and Wales \u2013 with a 51% conviction rate.\nThe statistics in this release are used by the UK for the reporting and monitoring of indicators 8.7.1 and 16.2.2 of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.

The majority of these referrals (60%) were of UK nationals (Dataset Table 4). \nTrends in the data may not reflect underlying changes in prevalence and may be related to changes in awareness and identification of potential child victims. \n\n\nFigure 1: National Referral Mechanism (NRM) referrals and positive reasonable grounds decisions continue to increase over time\n'Number of referrals to the NRM and positive referral grounds decisions (RGDs) of children, UK, year ending December 2009 to year ending December 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office \u2013 National Referral Mechanism\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 1: National Referral Mechanism (NRM) referrals and positive reasonable grounds decisions continue to increase over time\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nOf children who received a positive RGD (assessed as reasonably likely to be a victim of modern slavery) in the year ending December 2021:\nalmost four in five (79%) were boys and one in five (21%) were girls (Dataset Table 7)\nmore than four in five (82%) were aged 15 to 17 years (Dataset Table 8)\nboys were most likely to have experienced criminal exploitation (62%) and girls\u2019 sexual exploitation (42%; Figure 2)\n\n\nThey had loads of money and nice cars.

Data on modern slavery cases that come to the attention of the police only provide a partial picture as many cases remain unreported. Changes in police recording practices and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic have likely affected the number of child victims identified in recent years.\n\n\nI will get my head kicked in if I am seen talking to anyone.\n\n- female victim of sexual exploitation aged 14 years\n\nData from England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland cannot be combined to calculate the total number of offences in the UK, because they use different recording processes and offence codes.\nIn the year ending March 2021, police recorded modern slavery offences involving a child increased by 27% to 3,239, continuing the upwards trend seen in recent years (Dataset Table 12). The majority of offences were for \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d (64%; Dataset Table 12). \nThe proportion of offences involving boys has increased over time (Figure 3), accounting for four-fifths of recorded offences in the year ending March 2021. This may be because of the steep increase seen in \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d offences, where boys are typically victimised.\n\n\nFigure 3: Number of boys victimised increased more rapidly than girls\nNumber of police recorded modern slavery offences where victim was aged under 18 years, by sex, England and Wales, year ending March 2017 to year ending March 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office Data Hub \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nFigures are based on 40 police forces that supplied data, where both sex and age of victim were recorded.

In the five years between April 2016 and March 2021, around two-thirds (68%) of modern slavery offences involving children had a male victim. \nBetween April 2016 and March 2021, the Police Service of Northern Ireland recorded 25 modern slavery offences where the victim was aged under 18 years at the time of the offence. The majority of victims (72%) were girls (Dataset Table 16).\nModern slavery cases are among the most challenging and complex to investigate and prosecute. The hidden nature of this crime reduces the available evidence to make a charging decision. This is compounded by the level of control and coercion from perpetrators. \n\n\nI was scared he would come after me if I tried to leave.\n\n- female victim of sexual and criminal exploitation aged 14 years\n\nIn England and Wales, between April 2016 and March 2021, 185 prosecutions were completed for cases flagged as modern slavery in which the victim was a child. Of these cases, 95 resulted in a conviction and 90 in non-convictions (Dataset Table 17). Non-convictions were mainly because of prosecutions being dropped.\nIn the five years ending December 2021, Scotland completed eight prosecutions for modern slavery offences involving a child, and Northern Ireland completed one. However, none resulted in a conviction.\nThe children in need census (CIN) is an annual statutory census that collects data on children who are referred to local authority social care services in England. A child begins an \u201cepisode of need\u201d when they are referred to children\u2019s social care services. Local authorities then undertake an assessment of the child\u2019s needs to determine which services to provide.\nIn the year ending March 2021, a total of 496,030 episodes of need had a factor identified at the end of an assessment (Dataset Table 20). Of these, 16,830 identified the child sexual exploitation (CSE) factor, 2,710 identified the trafficking factor, and 1,950 identified the abuse linked to faith or belief factor (which includes domestic slavery and sexual exploitation). The number of episodes for CSE and trafficking each reflect a 10% decrease compared with the previous year. \nThe CSE factor was identified in more episodes of need for girls (11,230) than boys (5,490) \u2013 a pattern consistent over time (Dataset Table 20). This is illustrated in Figure 4. CSE accounted for 5% of all factors for girls, compared with 2% for boys.\n\n\nFigure 4: More girls had the child sexual exploitation factor flagged\nNumber of episodes of need with factors identified at the end of assessment, by factor and sex, England, year ending March 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Department for Education \u2013 Children in need census\n\nNotes:\n\nA child may have more than one episode of need during a year and therefore may be counted more than once in these figures.\nAn individual factor is counted only once against each episode of need.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 4: More girls had the child sexual exploitation factor flagged\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n \n\nMen took me, they did whatever they wanted to me. I just cried every night. If my parents ever found out, they\u2019d kill me.\n\n- female aged 16 years who was sexually exploited\n \nIn the year ending March 2021, children aged 10 to 15 years had the highest number of episodes of need with the CSE factor and abuse linked to faith factors (8,090 and 660 respectively). Children aged 16 years and over had the highest number of episodes of need with a trafficking factor identified (1,320; Dataset Table 21). \nData from charities help to indicate the number of victims seeking or accepting support, and subsequently the workload of the organisations, which may have been affected by the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. While such data provide insight into those victims receiving support, many are dependent on receiving cases from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM). They are therefore unlikely to highlight new victims of modern slavery.\n\n\nWe can only tackle it if we have successfully identified it in the first place, and this is why the data is so vital.\n\n- Sarah Parker, Catch22 Missing and Child Exploitation Services\n\nThe UK\u2019s Modern Slavery and Exploitation Helpline is independently operated by the anti-slavery charity, Unseen. Unseen gathers information from the calls and reports they receive through the helpline to build a picture of modern slavery in the UK and internationally. \nIn the year ending December 2021, the Modern Slavery and Exploitation Helpline indicated that there were 194 potential child victims (aged 17 years or under) of modern slavery from calls, webforms and app entries. This is a 43% decrease from the previous year (340; Dataset Table 22). Prior to this, the number of potential child victims indicated through the helpline year-on-year had remained stable. \nOf the 194 potential child victims of modern slavery indicated in the latest year, 61 were girls, 57 were boys, and the sex was unknown for the remining 76. This reflects the difficulty of collecting complete or accurate information from witness reports, particularly for such a hidden crime. \nBetween January 2017 and December 2021, 37% of potential child victims of modern slavery indicated through the helpline had experienced labour exploitation and 27% had experienced sexual exploitation (Dataset Table 23). While the number for labour exploitation has gradually decreased over the previous five years, the number for sexual exploitation had been increasing from the year ending December 2018 until the year ending December 2021, when it dropped by 69% (Figure 5). \n\n\nFigure 5: Child labour exploitation indicated by the helpline decreased over time\nNumber of potential child victims indicated from submissions to the Modern Slavery and Exploitation Helpline, by exploitation type, UK, year ending December 2017 to December 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Unseen \u2013 Modern Slavery and Exploitation Helpline\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 5: Child labour exploitation indicated by the helpline decreased over time\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThe Independent Child Trafficking Guardians (ICTGs) service is run by Barnardos and sponsored by the Home Office. It supports trafficked children to navigate criminal justice, immigration, and social care systems. \nIn the year ending December 2020, there were 27% more referrals than the previous year (555 compared with 437; Dataset Table 24). Data on demographics and exploitation type are presented for October 2018 to December 2019. Within this time frame, 379 boys and 134 girls were referred to ICTGs (Dataset Table 25), with a higher number of boys criminally exploited than girls (216 compared with 17; Dataset Table 26). \nCatch22 is a non-profit organisation that supports young people at risk of trafficking and exploitation through its Missing and Child Exploitation Services. This involves sharing intelligence with police, children\u2019s services, and Local Safeguarding Children Partnerships. \nOf providers within the service who were able to provide data in the year ending March 2021, Catch22 flagged 157 children at high risk of trafficking and exploitation across England (Dataset Table 28).\nThe Scottish Guardianship Service, run by Aberlour, supports unaccompanied asylum-seeking and trafficked children who arrive in Scotland alone (without parents), through immigration and welfare processes. If a trafficked child is referred to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), the Scottish Guardianship Service may provide supporting information as part of this process.\nBetween January 2019 and February 2022, the Scottish Guardianship Service submitted 147 trafficking-flagged cases of children to the NRM. Labour exploitation and cannabis cultivation (a type of criminal exploitation) accounted for 36% of referrals each (Figure 6). \n\n\nFigure 6: Most referrals were for child labour exploitation or cannabis cultivation\nProportion of Scottish Guardianship Service cases that identified a trafficking indicator and were referred to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), by type of exploitation, Scotland, January 2019 to February 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Aberlour \u2013 Scottish Guardianship Service\n\nNotes:\n\n''Intent to exploit\u201d are cases where a child has been trafficked with intent to exploit, however the child has either escaped or has been rescued before the exploitation could occur.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 6: Most referrals were for child labour exploitation or cannabis cultivation\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\n\nChild victims of modern slavery in the UK  Dataset | Released 29 March 2022  A range of available data from various organisations relating to child victims of modern slavery. \n\n\n", "summary": "Child victims of modern slavery and the coronavirus\nThe number of child victims of modern slavery identified by the police and through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) continues to increase.\nHowever, in the latest year we have seen falls in potential victims indicated by other data sources. This could be due to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdown restrictions and makes measuring the underlying number of child victims even more challenging.\nModern slavery covers all forms of slavery, human trafficking and exploitation. It is a hidden crime with victims often unable to come forward due to fear or shame, or because they are unable to leave their situation.\nThis is our first attempt to bring together data sources on child victims of modern slavery.\nIn the year ending December 2021, the number of referrals of children to the NRM increased by 9% compared with the previous year (from 5,028 to 5,468), continuing an upward trend over time.\nChanges in police recording practices and the coronavirus pandemic have likely affected the number of child victims identified in recent years.

Our\u00a0methodology article\u00a0provides more information on the methods used for our models.\nThis analysis was first presented in our\u00a0Analysis of populations in the UK by risk of testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19)\u00a0September 2021 publication, which provides a more detailed explanation of the methods used. We present findings for the most recent fortnight in this section, but a longer data time series covering 26 September 2021 to 12 March 2022 is available in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19, UK dataset.\nEstimates of the likelihood of some specific characteristics affecting an individual testing positive can fluctuate from one fortnight to another, meaning that findings that are statistically significant in one period may not necessarily be statistically significant in another period. This may be because the effect of a characteristic is genuinely changing, or because we do not have sufficient individuals with that characteristic in a particular fortnight to exclude any differences we find being down to chance.\nOur latest data for the fortnight ending 12 March 2022 shows similar conclusions to our last publication 2 March 2022, specifically that: \npeople who received a third vaccine 15 to 90 days ago, a second Pfizer vaccine 15 to 90 days ago or more than 180 days ago, a second AstraZeneca vaccine more than 180 days ago, one vaccine 15 to 180 days ago, or any vaccine up to 14 days ago, were less likely to test positive than those who reported not being vaccinated; there was no statistical evidence that having one vaccine more than 180 days ago, a second Pfizer vaccine 91 to 180 days ago or a third vaccine more than 90 days ago affected a person's likelihood of testing positive\npeople who had previously been infected [note 1] with coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to be less likely to test positive than those who had not been previously infected\npeople who were previously infected with COVID-19 during the period when the Delta variant was most common (May to December 2021) continued to be less likely to test positive than those infected prior to this period\npeople who had contact with hospitals, or shared a household with someone who had, continued to be less likely to test positive, compared with those living in households where no one had contact with hospitals\npeople who reported that they travelled abroad in the last 28 days continued to be more likely to test positive than those who had not\npeople who reported regularly using lateral flow tests continued to be more likely to test positive compared with those who did not; this is likely related to those at a higher risk of infection being encouraged to take regular lateral flow tests\nIn the same fortnight:\npeople from ethnic minority groups were less likely to test positive than those reporting White ethnicity\u00a0\npeople who were not working were less likely to test positive than those who were employed and working\u00a0\npeople living in multigenerational households were less likely to test positive than people not living in multigenerational households\u00a0\nfemales were less likely to test positive than males\npeople who were impacted \"a lot\" by a disability were less likely to test positive than those who were not impacted by a disability \u00a0\npeople who work in a care or nursing home were more likely to test positive than those who did not\nthose living in larger households in Northern Ireland and Scotland were more likely to test positive, but this was not the case in many other parts of the UK\nchildren and those aged around 30 years were more likely to test positive than people of other ages\nAn additional model examines the effect of behavioural characteristics on the likelihood of testing positive, while controlling for the core demographic variables and significant other characteristics shown earlier in this section. This means that we can identify which behavioural characteristics are associated with testing positive while taking other differences between people reporting different behaviours into account.\nOur findings suggest that in the fortnight ending 12 March 2022:\npeople who reported having physical contact with those aged under 70 years were more likely to test positive than people who had no physical contact with those aged under 70 years\npeople who reported that they spent more time socialising outside their home continued to be more likely to test positive\nThis section looks at the rate of coronavirus (COVID-19) re-infections in the UK, from 2 July 2020 to 20 March 2022.\nWe first presented results of re-infection analysis in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of re-infections of COVID-19: June 2021. The technical article provides a more detailed explanation of the methods used, some of which have since been updated. Improvements to our modelling approach apply to data published from 6 October 2021 onwards. Tables 5a to 5d in the\u00a0accompanying dataset\u00a0for this bulletin contain our updated re-infections data.\nWe have updated our definition of a re-infection in this analysis to reflect the shorter time between re-infections that have occurred during the Omicron variants period, compared with earlier variants.\nA re-infection was identified in this analysis if any one of the following three conditions were met.\na positive test 120 or more days after an initial first positive test and following one or more negative tests\na positive test 90 or more days after an initial first positive test and following two or more negative tests\na positive test 60 or more days after an initial first positive test and following three or more negative tests\na positive test after an initial first positive test and following four or more negative tests\nfor positive tests on or after 20 December 2021, when Omicron was the main variant, we also include positive tests 90 or more days after an initial first positive test and following one negative test.\nWhere both the first positive test and subsequent positive test have a high viral load, or there has been an increase in viral load between first positive test and subsequent positive tests.\nWhere there is evidence, based on either genetic sequencing data or gene positivity from the PCR swab test that the variant differs between positive tests.\nThis analysis includes individuals who have had at least one positive test recorded in the survey and meet our criteria for being \"at risk\" of re-infection. An individual is classified as \"at risk\" if it is possible for a test of theirs to be considered a re-infection if it turns out to be positive. The \"at-risk period\" refers to the period following the first time we could have defined a re-infection based on condition one. A re-infection is therefore only identified when an \"at risk\" individual has a positive test. This analysis only includes COVID-19 Infection Survey\u00a0test results, in contrast to the definition we use for previous infections in the characteristics associated with testing positive analysis, which uses data from other sources, and uses a different definition.\nFrom 20 December 2021 onwards, substantial numbers of infections compatible with the Omicron variants were observed in the survey. Therefore, to differentiate between the period when the earlier Alpha or Delta variants were most common from the Omicron variants period, we now estimate rates of re-infection up to 19 December 2021 and from 20 December 2021 onwards separately (see Table 1).\nViral load is approximated by Cycle threshold (Ct) values, which are lower with a high viral load. Participant days at risk and Ct values are further defined in our\u00a0Glossary.\nThis section presents updated analysis of the risk factors associated with a coronavirus (COVID-19) re-infection identified among participants across the UK who had previously tested positive in the survey. This analysis included 37,298 participants \"at risk\" of re-infection and 3,540 re-infections identified between 2 July 2020 and 20 March 2022.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of re-infections of COVID-19: June 2021\u00a0outlines the model used to investigate how the rate of re-infection varies over time and between individuals. This model explores multiple factors including:\nage\nsex\nethnicity\nCycle threshold (Ct) value observed in the initial infection\ndeprivation\nhousehold size\nworking in patient-facing healthcare\nlong-term health conditions\nvaccination status\nthe period during which an individual was at risk\nFor updated methodology, please refer to our technical article.\nWe define the Alpha variant period as prior to 17 May 2021, the Delta variant period as 17 May to 19 December 2021, and the Omicron variants period as 20 December 2021 onwards.\nThe risk of re-infection by characteristic is measured in terms of hazard ratios and presented in Figure 4. In addition to the variables presented in Figure 4, we also looked at the risk of re-infection during the periods when different variants became most common.\nCompared with the period when the Delta variant was most common, the risk of re-infection was approximately 10 times higher in the period when the Omicron variants were most common (95% confidence interval: 8 to 14 times higher).\nPeople who were unvaccinated were more likely to be re-infected\u00a0than\u00a0people who had been vaccinated.\nPeople who reported symptoms within 35 days of the first positive test in their first infection were less likely to be re-infected. People were more likely to be re-infected if they had a lower viral load (higher Ct value) in their first infection; both of these findings may be because of a weaker immune response in \"milder\" primary infections.\nOlder people were less likely to be re-infected.\nPeople who live in less deprived areas were less likely to be re-infected than people living in more deprived areas.\nHazard ratios for all characteristics included in the model, including for age and for Ct values separately, can be found in Tables 6a to 6c in the\u00a0accompanying dataset. Estimated rates of re-infection over time can be found in table 6d in the accompanying dataset.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19, UK Dataset | Released 30 March 2022 Characteristics of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency and Wellcome Trust.

The pupil antibody test used in SIS is based on oral fluid collection because this is a non-invasive alternative to collecting blood. However, this test has a lower sensitivity (estimated at 80%) for unvaccinated pupils. To account for this, results from unvaccinated pupils were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody tests. For more information on the adjustments, please see the Glossary section.\nThe unadjusted percent of pupils testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 50.3% in primary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 47.9% to 52.7%) and 86.8% in secondary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 84.3% to 89.1%).\n\n!\n\nPupils were tested for both anti-N (antibodies from natural infection) and anti-S (antibodies from natural infection or vaccination) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Further information about the antibody tests used can be found in our COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey, 2021 to 2022: methods and further information article. \n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the percentage of pupils with SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels above the limit of detection in schools sampled. After adjusting for the sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests and the vaccination status of pupils tested, we estimate that 62.4% of primary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 60.0% to 64.7%) and 96.6% of secondary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 95.1% to 97.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels above the limit of detection.\nThe percentage of pupils testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies increased significantly for both primary school and secondary school pupils between Round 1 (10 November to 10 December) and Round 2, as shown in Figure 2.\nIn Round 1, 40.1% of primary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 37.3% to 43.0%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels above the limit of detection, after adjusting for sensitivity and specificity. For secondary school pupils, 82.4% (95% confidence intervals: 79.5% to 85.1%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels above the limit of detection.\nAntibody testing in Round 2 took place while COVID-19 cases in England were increasing because of the Omicron variant (declared a variant of concern on 27 November 2021), especially among school children. It is likely that antibody prevalence was higher in Round 2 than Round 1 because of an increase in infections in the community and the continuing vaccination programme for secondary school pupils.\nPupil vaccination data were obtained by linking to the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS). Pupils were defined as vaccinated if they had their first dose at least 14 days before their antibody test.\nOf secondary school pupils tested in Round 2, 46.6% had received at least one vaccination dose at least 14 days before their antibody test. No primary school pupils tested in Round 2 were vaccinated. Based on adjusted figures, 97.4% (95% confidence intervals: 96.1% to 98.4%) of vaccinated secondary school pupils had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 97.0% (95% confidence intervals: 95.5% to 98.1%) of unvaccinated secondary school pupils had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.\nFigure 3 shows the percentage of pupils that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by their vaccination status. At the time of antibody testing in Round 2, most secondary school pupils (those aged 12 years and over) were eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. Based on adjusted figures, 45.4% (95% confidence intervals: 41.9% to 48.9%) of pupils were both vaccinated and SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive and 51.2% (95% confidence intervals: 47.7% to 54.7%) were unvaccinated and antibody positive. Further analysis by vaccination status, including by region and age, can be found in our accompanying dataset.\nResults based on vaccination status should be treated as an indication only. Vaccinated pupils could develop antibodies through vaccination and/or natural infection, whereas unvaccinated pupils will only have antibodies following natural infection. Antibodies following natural infection could fall below levels of detection faster than antibodies following vaccination. Further information can be found in the\u00a0Strengths and limitations\u202fsection.\nFigure 4 shows the adjusted percentage of pupils in primary and secondary schools testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by region. The highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in secondary school pupils were identified in London (greater than 99%, 95% confidence intervals: 95.3% to 100%) and the West Midlands (greater than 99%, 95% confidence intervals: 95.5% to 100%).\nAs in Round 1, the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for primary school pupils were identified in the West Midlands (73.6%, 95% confidence intervals: 66.8% to 79.7%). In all regions, more secondary school pupils tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than primary school pupils. More information on breakdowns by region, including unadjusted figures, is available in\u00a0our accompanying dataset.\nFigure 5 shows the adjusted percentage of pupils testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by age. The proportion of primary school pupils (those aged 4 to 10 years) testing positive for antibodies steadily increased by age.\nAmong secondary school pupils, nearly all pupils aged between 12 and 15 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Pupils aged 12 years and over were eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine at the time of testing. More information on breakdowns by age for pupils aged 4 to 16 years, including unadjusted figures, is available in\u00a0our accompanying dataset.\nOver a half of pupils aged four to seven years (54.9%, 95% confidence intervals: 51.4% to 58.4%) tested positive for antibodies. This is a statistically significant increase from Round 1 (33.9%, 95% confidence intervals: 30.1% to 37.9%).\nIn our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, antibody data, UK bulletin, we also produce antibody estimates for pupils aged 8 to 11 years and aged 12 to 15 years.

We also compare changes in the types of goods and services purchased during the pandemic with those purchased during the impact of the global financial crisis. We also use higher-frequency credit card transactions data to provide insight into the effects of the Omicron variant in late 2021.\n\n!\n\nFrom Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020, estimates of household final consumption expenditure have been subject to more uncertainty than usual. The temporary suspension of the Living Cost and Food survey (LCF), and other data sources for Office for National Statistics household expenditure estimates have led to some difficulties with data surveying and collection.\n\n\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on household spending has been more striking than that of the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis (GFC). This reflects the effects of coronavirus restrictions that were in place during 2020 and 2021, which particularly affected non-essential retail, hospitality, and recreational and cultural industries (Figure 1). Recent analysis from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) found that 45% of respondents avoided close contact with people they do not live with to avoid infection, compared with 94% when surveyed in April 2020. This highlights how consumer behaviour has changed over time. Households were more cautious in the earlier stages of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe effects of the coronavirus pandemic hit household spending harder and faster than following the GFC. During the first two quarters of the pandemic, household spending fell 22.2% because of the introduction of lockdowns and other public health restrictions. These particularly affected \u201csocial spending\u201d, such as dining in restaurants and cafes, recreation, and culture. \nHousehold spending recovered 19.6% in the following quarter and had almost returned to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels two years after the start of the pandemic, while household spending took over five years to recover following the GFC (Figure 1). This likely reflects the fact that household incomes have largely been protected since the start of the pandemic given the availability of government schemes such as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme. \nMass closures of parts of the economy and the shift towards working from home help explain the changes in spending habits over the last two years. During the height of the first UK lockdown (between 23 March and 5 April 2020), Office for National Statistics (ONS) Business Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Survey (BICS) data found that 24% of businesses that responded had temporarily closed or paused trading. This is reflected in real-time indicators that track spending on credit and debit cards. The indicators have captured some of the behavioural responses to the coronavirus restrictions, in particular, social and work-related spending. \nRecent ONS analysis on homeworking and household spending found that almost half (46%) of homeworkers who responded said they spent less money while working from home because of the coronavirus pandemic. \nFigure 2 shows the comparison between the effect of the GFC and the coronavirus pandemic on household spending on goods and services. Household spending during the coronavirus pandemic saw lower spending on services. This is in contrast to the period after the GFC when the impact on household spending was smaller and more evenly distributed across goods and services. \nThis decrease in spending on services during the coronavirus pandemic was mostly driven by the tightening and easing of spending restrictions in high contact service industries. Other developed economies also experienced this shift between spending. The changes in relative demand and supply in the global economy may help explain some of the recent inflationary trends that have been experienced in recent months. For example, the latest Bank of England Monetary Policy Report says that it is this switch in demand from services to goods that has further worsened the supply chain disruption.\n\u201cSocial consumption\u201d refers to spending on eating out, leisure travel and cultural activities, which have been particularly affected by coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions (Figure 3). Households have been unable and/or unwilling to spend on these types of social activities, because of the restrictions that have been in place and possibly also personal concerns for virus transmission. Figure 3 shows how household spending on services has evolved during the coronavirus pandemic relative to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019, and that social consumption has been most affected.\nThe largest decline in spending on services for Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020 was mostly driven by restaurant and hotel services, mainly restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Spending on transport services such as air and rail transport have also fallen sharply, reflecting the local and international mobility restrictions in place at the time. \nFigure 3 also shows that within recreation and culture, spending on cultural services such as cinemas and theatres, as well as sporting services , which include gyms and live sport attendances, were most negatively affected for Quarter 2 2020. However, there was an increase in spending on pets and pet products, and veterinary services, which has been above its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels since Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020. This could be explained by the rise in the number of households with pets, from 41% of households with pets in 2019 to 2020 to 59% of households with pets in 2020 to 2021, according to the Pet Food Manufacturers\u2019 Association. \nSpending in restaurants and hotels rose as coronavirus restrictions eased. The low levels of spending in transport services could be because of behavioural changes by households, such as the shift to working from home and local travel restrictions. Recent findings from the Opinions and Lifestyle survey on homeworking and spending show that half of homeworkers reported spending less on fuel and parking for commuting, and two-fifths reported spending less on commuting using public transport.\nOffice for National Statistics (ONS) analysis on how people spent their time during lockdown found that households were spending more time on leisure activities, such as gardening and DIY, in April 2020 when coronavirus restrictions were stricter. Spending on other services including hairdressing, education, and outpatient services grew as government restrictions eased. Expenditure on vehicle fuel and maintenance services recovered beyond its pre-coronavirus pandemic level following the end of the extension of the MOT test interval and as local travel restrictions loosened.\nHousehold spending on goods has shown a faster recovery than spending on services. Figure 4 shows that while there was an initial decline in household spending on semi-durables, which can be mostly attributed to the closure of non-essential retail, spending recovered and exceeded pre-coronavirus pandemic levels in Quarter 3 (Jul to Sep) 2020. This recovery was mainly driven by spending on recording media, toys and hobby equipment, and sporting and camping equipment. The recovery may be linked to businesses expanding their online operations as more households turned to online shopping in response to the coronavirus pandemic; there was a rise in the share of online shopping in total retail sales.\nFigure 4 also shows that there was a rise in home improvements and home entertainment (digital subscription and recording media). This could be explained by people spending more time at home because of homeworking and studying at home. This could also be linked to the housing market as evident in the Bank of England\u2019s 2021 Quarter 4 Credit Conditions Survey which shows the increase in demand for secured lending for house purchases and re-mortgaging over the coronavirus pandemic. \nThe rise in spending on equipment relating to staycations and outdoor exercising may be because more households chose to engage in outdoor leisure to mitigate the risks from COVID-19. Evidence suggests that as restrictions eased there was a rise in people visiting parks and travelling between local authorities as found by the Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports.\nThere have also been some examples of shifts in spending between and within products. For example, Figure 5 shows ONS estimates of \u201ctotal dining\u201d which captures a broader measure of spending on food and drink \u2013 it covers spending on food, non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages, and catering services \u2013 and includes those consumed at home. There was a sharp fall in expenditure on catering services, but an increase in spending on food and beverages consumed at home. The subsequent recovery in catering services may be partially because of the inclusion of takeaways. Under coronavirus restrictions, more restaurants and pubs grew their takeaway services. As household spending on catering services recovered over the coronavirus pandemic, expenditure on food and beverage consumed at home fell. \nAs part of our response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we have developed a range of real-time indicators to provide more timely and higher-frequency insights into how the economy is evolving over time. We have been working collaboratively with the financial technology company Revolut [note 1]\u00b9 which has allowed us to produce additional consumer spending insights. This includes understanding some of the impacts in response to the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021. \nFigure 6 shows a relative change in card spending, comparing the change in the monthly levels in December 2021 with the change in the monthly levels in December 2019. Given the seasonality in these types of transactions, this differencing allows us to approximate what the effect of the Omicron variant might have been on \u201ctypical\u201d spending in December 2021. Total card spending was 3% lower relatively in December 2021, particularly driven by declines in pubs, restaurants, and fast food, entertainment, and travel and hotels. These trends likely reflect the cautious behaviour by individuals to reduce the spread of Omicron and restrictions that were introduced in the UK. \nThere was a relative increase in spending on food and drink, which includes supermarkets and convenience stores, and might capture some shifts in demand by consumers. Services include financial services, utility and insurance, professional services, which are less likely to be affected by any type of restrictions. \n\n\nFigure 6: Timely card transactions insights point to a relative decline in spending on pubs, restaurants, and fast food, entertainment, and travel and hotels in December 2021\nDifference in the monthly change between December 2021 and December 2019 spending levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Revolut \u2013 Office for National Statistics (ONS) calculations\n\nNotes:\n\nMerchant category codes classify businesses dependent upon primary business categories, which are then grouped into higher, mutually exclusive sectoral levels.\nRetail spending includes clothing, department, mixed retail, and household stores.\nFood and drink includes supermarkets, convenience and other food providers.\nEntertainment includes membership clubs, cinemas, ticketed events, sports, galleries, and tourist attractions.\nServices includes financial services, utility and insurance, professional, and hospitality and personal services.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 6: Timely card transactions insights point to a relative decline in spending on pubs, restaurants, and fast food, entertainment, and travel and hotels in December 2021\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\n\nConsumer trends: chained volume measure, seasonally adjusted Dataset | Released 31 March 2022 Quarterly and annual data on household expenditure in the UK, chained volume measure, seasonally adjusted.

High-frequency credit card transactions data, which provide insights into the initial impact of the Omicron variant on spending, reinforced some of the earlier trends seen during the pandemic.\nThe extent to which any of the changes in how and what we consume that have been experienced over the last two years may continue into the future is uncertain. For example, increased levels of hybrid working could have an impact on where spending is taking place and what people are spending money on. On the other hand, the online share of retail spending has fallen considerably from its coronavirus pandemic highs, as shops and restaurants re-open. We will continue to provide insights on the extent to which we see any structural changes.\n", "summary": "COVID-19 caused a larger impact on spending than the 2008 recession\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused a larger impact on household spending in the UK than the 2008 financial crisis.\nUnprecedented public health measures during the pandemic caused an uneven fall in spending on goods and services. Reduced spending in restaurants, hotels and transport services were the main drivers for the overall fall in spending, along with changes in the ways goods and services were consumed following the start of the recovery from the pandemic.\nNew insights from card spending transaction data show that the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant in late 2021 led to relatively lower levels of spending in pubs, restaurants and fast-food venues along with entertainment, and travel and hotels. Meanwhile there was a relative increase in spending on food and drink.\nDuring the first two quarters of the pandemic, household spending fell 22.2% because of the introduction of lockdown and other public health restrictions, which particularly impacted \u201csocial spending\u201d, such as restaurants and cafes, recreation and culture. Household spending recovered 19.6% in the following quarter and had almost returned to pre-coronavirus levels after two years following the pandemic. Following the financial crisis, household spending took over five years to recover.\n", "id": 255}, {"document": "In February 2022, most UK residents (91%) and overseas residents (88%) arriving in the UK said they had received at least two coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations.\nTwo in three UK residents and half of overseas residents arriving in the UK had received more than two COVID-19 vaccinations.\nThe proportion of travellers arriving in the UK with more than two COVID-19 vaccinations has continued to rise for both UK and overseas residents (68% and 50% respectively; February 2022).\n\n!\n\nThis bulletin contains unweighted data.

More than two-thirds (68%) of UK residents arriving in the UK and half (50%) of overseas residents arriving in the UK had received more than two COVID-19 vaccinations (Figure 1).\nThe increase in the percentage of UK residents who had received more than two vaccinations reflects the expansion of the National Health Service (NHS) booster programme to all adults over 18 years of age, with those eligible to have been offered a vaccination by the end of February 2022. This follows the advice given to UK health departments by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in light of the new Omicron variant.\nThe UK coronavirus dashboard shows 92% of all UK residents had received at least one vaccination by 28 February 2022, with 85% having received two vaccinations and 67% having received a booster or three vaccinations. In line with the vaccine rollout programme, UK residents arriving into the UK in the older age groups were more likely to have received their first vaccination earlier in the year. Proportions reporting that they have had at least one vaccination have remained stable among these older age groups from September 2021 but have increased in younger age groups.\nDownload the data\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

It considers what percentage of these people reported individual and groups of symptoms [note 1] within 35 days of the first positive test. We present this analysis for the whole of the UK split by month, which covers 1 December 2020 to 27 March 2022, and for the period from 1 December 2021 to 27 March 2022 split by UK country.

We have seen that the viral load of strong positive results increased during January 2022, as measured by decreases in the average Ct value (see\u00a0Glossary, for more information on Ct values). This will also affect the prevalence of symptoms within these strong positive cases.\nIn March 2022, 66% (95% confidence interval: 66% to 67%) of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the UK with a strong positive test reported any specific symptoms [note 1].\nThe percentage of people testing positive who reported \"any\" and \"classic\" symptoms increased from January to March 2022. The percentage of people testing positive who reported loss of taste or smell decreased sharply between December 2021 and January 2022 and remains at a lower level in March 2022. These changes coincide with increasing infections with the Omicron variants of COVID-19. The percentage of people testing positive who reported gastrointestinal symptoms decreased slightly in December 2021 and has remained unchanged since then.\nThe percentages of people testing positive who reported each group of symptoms are similar for each country between 1 December 2021 and 27 March 2022. However, the percentage of people testing positive who reported \"any\" symptoms and \"classic\" symptoms were higher for Scotland compared with the other UK countries.\u200b\n\n!\n\nBecause of smaller sample sizes in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison with England, the confidence intervals are wider indicating higher uncertainty. \n\n\n\nIn the UK, the most commonly reported symptoms have consistently been cough, fatigue and headache. The least commonly reported symptoms have consistently been abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and nausea or vomiting. The percentage of people reporting a sore throat, cough or fatigue increased between January and March 2022, and the percentage reporting myalgia increased between February and March 2022. However,\u00a0these are symptoms that can occur with a number of other infections circulating at the same time, such as the common cold or flu. The percentage of people reporting loss of taste or loss of smell, fatigue and headache decreased sharply in December 2022, when the Omicron variants of COVID-19 became most common.\u200b\nDownload the data\nWe report on recent trends in this section, but the full data time series for this analysis, which covers the period between 20 July 2020 and 27 March 2022 for England, and 28 September 2020 to 27 March 2022 for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, is available in the\u00a0accompanying dataset.

Our estimates have been weighted to be representative of the total population in each of the four UK countries.\nThe number of socially distanced contacts adults reported with all ages has increased since January 2022 in all four UK countries.\nIn all four UK countries, the number of physical contacts adults reported with all ages increased temporarily over Christmas but fell back down to previous levels in January 2022, likely because of decreased mixing following Christmas. However, the number of physical contacts has increased slightly since January 2022 in England and Wales.\n\u200bSchool term dates, and coronavirus (COVID-19)-related school policies vary by nation and this is reflected in the data.

The article uses a statistical model to examine which characteristics of people sampled in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) are associated with those who did and did not report having received a third vaccination against COVID-19 of those who were eligible.\nEligibility for receiving a third vaccination was defined as those adults who had received their second vaccination at least three months ago. This was defined as three 28-day periods; 84 days. Adults who had not received any vaccinations, or had received only one vaccination or a second vaccination within the previous three months were not eligible and have not been included in this analysis.\nThose eligible for a third vaccination and vaccination rates differed considerably by age, mainly because of first and second vaccinations occurring at different times in different age groups. Adults are now only eligible for a third vaccination if their second vaccination was at least three months ago, but this has also varied over time, being initially six months. This meant that people then became eligible for their third vaccination at different times.\nAnalysis was restricted to eligible participants in the following age groups: 18 to 34 years, 35 to 64 years, and those aged 65 years and over. These age groups were also used in our previous article, CIS technical article: Analysis of characteristics associated with vaccination uptake. Third vaccination uptake within these groups is summarised in Figure 1.\nThis analysis used vaccination status reported by participants taking part in the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS). CIS is a large household survey monitoring COVID-19 infections within private households in the UK. It excludes those in hospitals, care homes, or other communal establishments. Participants are asked about demographics, living environment, behaviours, work, and vaccination uptake. Further information on the study design can be found in COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nDaily official government vaccination figures provide the recorded actual numbers of vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2. Our vaccination estimates are likely to differ from the official figures because they are estimates based on a sample survey. In addition, our sampling method for Northern Ireland is different to the other UK nations. Our method in Northern Ireland is to only invite people who have previously participated in a Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) survey, which could result in a sample of individuals who are more likely to get vaccinated.\nDifferences between official figures and the estimates from this survey may also vary in scale across each of the four UK nations (with some survey estimates closer to the official reported figures than others). This is because of differences in reporting dates and the inclusion of National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) data for England. We use NIMS data where it is available for survey participants, and use self-reported vaccination status where NIMS information is not available. Adding this information improves the quality of the data we have for England. The equivalent of NIMS is currently not available for other countries, so vaccination estimates for Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are produced only from self-reported vaccination status. This means that vaccination estimates may differ more for these countries because they rely on the accuracy of participants' reporting of how many vaccinations they have received. To make sure that comparisons of other characteristics are not affected by this, we control for country and region in all estimates.\nIn this analysis, two logistic regression models were run for each of the three age groups: 18 to 34 years, 35 to 64 years, and those aged 65 years and over. Our outcome was third vaccination status - defined as a participant having received three COVID-19 vaccinations prior to their most recent survey visit, which took place in the 28-day period from 21 February to 20 March 2022. The models included all participants across the UK who had received a second vaccination more than 84 days ago (three 28-day periods ago) and were therefore eligible for their third vaccination.\nOur first model, Model 1 (the core model), estimated the likelihood of an individual having received a third vaccination, for eight core demographic characteristics:\nsex\nethnicity\nage\ngeographical region\nurban or rural classification of their address\ndeprivation percentile\nhousehold size\nwhether the household was multigenerational\nThese characteristics are related to each other, for example some regions have higher levels of deprivation. To estimate the impact of each characteristic on its own, we need to control for the impact of all of these factors in one model. Model 1 estimated the total effect of these core demographic characteristics on the likelihood of having a third vaccination and included all participants. The model gives the overall effect of these factors and does not try to estimate how much of these overall effects might be explained by other factors such as work status.\nModel 2 tested whether other factors that may change over time, such as work status, affected the likelihood of having had a third vaccination. The core characteristics can affect the likelihood of being vaccinated both directly and indirectly through other factors (such as work status or health status). Therefore, for this second group of characteristics, we also adjusted for the core demographic characteristics. This means that we can say, for example, that people aged 35 to 64 years were less likely to have received a third vaccination if they were not working between 21 February and 20 March 2022, regardless of where in the UK they lived, or whether they were a man or a woman. It also means that when looking at results for Model 2, we do not draw conclusions about the core demographic characteristics from Model 1. Work status was included in Model 2 for each of the three age groups.\nHaving tested the different characteristics for Model 2, we only included characteristics that were associated with whether someone reported having had a third vaccination independently of the other characteristics. We did this using a backward elimination technique, with a significance threshold of 0.05.\nBoth models were used for all three age groups. Outputs of each model are presented in the accompanying dataset.\nThis analysis used data from 21 February to 20 March 2022. During this period, 37,263 people aged 18 to 34 years had survey visits, of whom 33,710 participants were eligible for their third coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination (who had received their second vaccination at least 84 days ago). We restricted analysis to this subset, of whom 26,848 (80%) participants reported having received a third vaccination.\nFigure 2 presents findings from Model 1 for those aged 18 to 34 years who were eligible.

During this period, 111,714 people aged 65 years and over had survey visits, of whom 110,948 participants were eligible for their third coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination (who had received their second vaccination at least 84 days ago). We restricted analysis to this subset, of whom 108,745 (98%) participants reported having received a third vaccination.\nFigure 6 presents findings from Model 1 for those aged 65 years and over who were eligible. Key findings are that those:\nwho lived in more deprived areas were less likely to have received a third vaccination\nidentifying as non-white ethnic minorities were less likely to have received a third vaccination than those reporting white ethnicities\nliving in multigenerational households were less likely to have received a third vaccination\nfrom two person households were more likely to have received a third vaccination compared with those living alone\nThere are fewer statistically significant associations in the oldest age group because there are far fewer people who have not received a third vaccination who were eligible to do so. As a result, the model has less power to detect effects, and the findings that it does produce have greater uncertainty, as indicated by wider confidence intervals in Figure 6.\nResults for other characteristics included in the model can be found in the accompanying dataset.\nDownload the data\nFigure 7 presents the effects of additional factors on the likelihood of people aged 65 years and over having received a third vaccination against COVID-19.\nKey findings are that those:\nwho worked five days or more outside the home were less likely to have received a third vaccination\nworking in care homes, or the personal services or transport sectors were less likely to have received a third vaccination\nwith a disability that affected them a lot, or who live with someone whose disability affected them a lot, were less likely to have received a third vaccination\nwho had previously been infected with COVID-19 in the pre-Alpha or Alpha periods were less likely to have received a third vaccination\nDownload the data\nGenerally, these findings are consistent with the findings from our previous analysis regarding the uptake of first coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations, even though the analysis of third vaccinations was restricted to those who had already had two vaccinations.\nThose living in more deprived areas were consistently less likely to receive a first or third vaccination across all three age groups. For first or third vaccinations, those identifying as a non-white ethnicity were less likely to have been vaccinated than those reporting white ethnicities in the 18 to 34 years and 35 to 64 years age groups. For third vaccinations, this effect was also seen in those aged 65 years and over. Those reporting working in the hospitality, personal services, transport and manufacturing sectors had lower uptake of both first and third vaccinations in the 18 to 34 years age group. The hospitality, personal services and transport sectors also had lower vaccination uptake in the 35 to 64 years age group. Those who had been previously infected in any age group were less likely to have received first or third vaccinations.\nFemales were more likely to have had third vaccinations across the youngest two age groups; this effect was not observed in our analysis of first vaccinations. Those aged 18 to 64 years who had contact with care homes were more likely to have had a first vaccination. This association was not found for third vaccinations, and those who worked in a care home in the 35 to 64 years and 65 years and over age groups were less likely to have had a third vaccination.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) third vaccination uptake Dataset | Released 21 April 2022 Analysis of populations in the UK by likelihood of having received a third vaccination against COVID-19 using the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey.

The lack of uptake was also seen among those not currently working or who were working entirely from home (compared to those working one or two days per week outside of the home). The final group to be seen avoiding the third vaccination were males, aged between 18 and 64 years.\nThis article used a statistical model to examine the data from 21 February to 20 March 2022.

Each participant was regularly tested during the duration of their time in the study. The swabs were tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We use COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19 in the UK. The people included in the survey were aged two years and over and were living in private households; those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments were not included.\nWe take all positive and negative tests in the survey and apply statistical modelling techniques to estimate the number of people who have had COVID-19 in the population, in each of the four UK nations for the duration of the survey.\nThis analysis provides an estimate of the number of people who have ever had a coronavirus (COVID-19) infection during the time periods covered by our survey. The starts dates for this analysis relate to when the survey started, which is different for each country, and the analysis goes up to 11 February 2022. Therefore, the time periods covered are:\n27 April 2020 to 11 February 2022 for England\n30 June 2020 to 11 February 2022 for Wales\n27 July 2020 to 11 February 2022 for Northern Ireland\n22 September 2020 to 11 February 2022 for Scotland\nIn epidemiology, daily prevalence is the number of people with an infection on a given day, while incidence is the number of people newly infected on a given day. In the survey, we estimate both the number of people in the population who would test positive on a nose and throat swab (positivity) and the number of people who would be newly positive on a nose and throat swab each day (incidence). We do this using both positive and negative swab results.\nPositivity refers to the proportion or number of people who would test positive on any given day if we sampled the whole population. Positivity is not the true number infected on a given day, it is those testing positive on a given day. To calculate the true number of people infected on a given day (prevalence), we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nTo estimate how many people have had at least one COVID-19 infection we need to first estimate the number of people who would test positive for the first time on any given day and then aggregate this over time. We first estimate the daily proportion of the population who would test positive with their first known COVID-19 infection (if they were tested). We then apply our established incidence methodology to provide an estimate of the daily numbers becoming test-positive for the first time, and then aggregate this to estimate the number of people who have ever been test-positive.\nTo differentiate between subsequent infections in the same person, and to estimate the length of time a person would test positive for, we need to define an episode of infection. In this analysis, a new episode of infection is defined by:\na new positive test which occurs 120 days or more after an individual's first positive test in the\u00a0survey\u00a0and their most recent prior test result was negative\nor, if 120 days has not passed since their first positive test in the survey, the individual's last positive test has been followed by four consecutive negative tests\nAny other positive tests are counted as being within the same infection episode. In this analysis, to estimate the daily proportion of the population who would test positive with their first COVID-19 infection, we reclassify any positive tests after the first infection episode as \"negative\". Reclassifying positive tests in observed subsequent infection episodes allows us to include only first infections to estimate positivity with a first COVID-19 infection, while retaining in the population people who have had COVID-19 before.\nWe then apply a general additive mixed model (GAMM) to obtain a smoothed time series of positivity and post-stratify using age and region to obtain a nationally representative estimate. For England, because of computing constraints, two models were run from 27 April 2020 to 11 May 2021 and 12 April 2021 to 11 February 2022. These two models overlap by 30 days from 12 April to 11 May 2021 to allow for the resulting incidence estimates series to be smoothly spliced together.\nTo obtain the daily incidence of new positive infection episodes, we require an estimate of how long a person with a COVID-19 infection will test positive for. Using data from people who have tested positive in the survey we can estimate the time between a person first testing positive and when they would first test negative again. This duration varies from person to person and so we estimate and allow for the duration distribution to vary over the course of the coronavirus pandemic.\nWe combine the estimates of positivity and duration to obtain daily incidence. That is, we transform the \"first infection episode\" positivity series into daily incidence of \"first episodes\" of being test-positive. In general, incidence and duration can be used straightforwardly to give prevalence. The reverse process of estimating incidence is called \"deconvolution\".\nSpecifically in our case, having reclassified the data so only positive tests in first episodes are counted positive, positivity on any given day is the sum of those first testing positive on previous days who are still test-positive on that particular day. A single linear equation relates prior (unknown) daily incidence, and corresponding (known) durations, to each day's (known) positivity. Combining multiple days of positivity gives a system of linear equations which can be solved mathematically to give the unknown daily incidences. The daily incidences are cumulated to give the estimated number of people who have ever been test-positive over time.\nOwing to computing constraints because of the large amount of data, it was not possible to run one positivity model for England across the whole time period. The positivity series and deconvolution were therefore run twice, and the resulting two incidence series spliced together. The two series were weighted and averaged on each day of the 30 day overlap proportionally to their position in the overlap period. For example, the first day of the overlap period gave the early model 100% weight and late model 0% weight, linearly swapping over time. The overlap of 30 days gives a reliable, smooth join, and the join is positioned at a period of very low positivity to minimise the impact of the splicing.\nA smaller number of participants from each of the devolved administrations meant it was possible to run a single model for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland separately. As such, splicing was not necessary.\nThe figures from the different devolved administrations are not directly comparable with each other or the England estimate as they refer to different time periods.\nThe cumulative incidence analysis produces an estimate of the number of people who have been infected with coronavirus (COVID-19) since the start of the Coronavirus Infection Survey (CIS) to 11 February 2022 for each of the four UK countries. The start dates for this analysis relate to when the survey started, which is different for each country.\nAcross all four UK countries, the percentage of the population that have had COVID-19 since the start of the survey has increased at varying rates up to February 2022. An estimated:\n70.7% of the population in England (90% credible intervals: 66.0% to 75.6%) had COVID-19 between 27 April 2020 and 11 February 2022\n56.0% of the population in Wales (90% credible intervals: 44.3% to 69.4%) had COVID-19 between 30 June 2020 and 11 February 2022\n72.2% of the population in Northern Ireland (90% credible intervals: 56.0% to 90.9%) had COVID-19 between 27 July 2020 and 11 February 2022\n51.5% of the population in Scotland (90% credible intervals: 40.5% to 63.6%) had COVID-19 between 22 September 2020 and 11 February 2022\nOur estimates are based on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS), a nationally representative survey that tests a large sample of people living in private households each month. Because we retest the same people, regardless of whether they have symptoms, we can identify both infections and re-infections and our data includes asymptomatic cases. This allows us to estimate the number of people who have had COVID-19 since the survey began in April 2020.\nOur estimates of cumulative incidence are broadly consistent with those modelled by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University, which are based on Office for National Statistics (ONS) data. The Cambridge University modelling estimates that 40.2 million people had COVID-19 in England from 20 February 2020 to 10 February 2022. Their approach is different in how re-infections are treated. Currently (April 2022), they estimate that 30% of all infections are re-infections.\nOther data sources provide different totals of people who test positive for COVID-19 over periods of time. However, because they are not based on repeat testing, it is not possible to establish whether a positive test is an initial infection or a re-infection.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures compile the number of people who have tested positive in the last seven days and the total number of people who tested positive during the coronavirus pandemic (from 30 January 2020). The dashboard is based on clinical testing data, including NHS Test and Trace data (using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results and results of registered lateral flow devices), which have a number of limitations.\nNHS Test and Trace data are primarily a clinical testing service for people in England with symptoms or who have been in contact with known COVID-19 cases. Testing capacity has varied over the course of the pandemic. This means that the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 through NHS Test and Trace data will not be nationally representative and are likely to underrepresent people that were infected but did not experience symptoms. The data were not intended for use in monitoring prevalence or incidence, and we do not know how many of these positive tests are re-infections.\nAdditionally, clinical testing data are collected differently across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, meaning that total estimates are not directly comparable between countries. The methodology used to produce estimates from the CIS is consistent for all UK countries.\nThe Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study also collects data about the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general population, but is limited in scope to England. Each month, 150,000 different participants are tested to assess community transmission of COVID-19 in real time. However, since participants are different each month, it is not possible to calculate incidence or numbers of re-infections.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Cumulative incidence of the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 infections, UK  Dataset | Released 22 April 2022  Estimated percentage of the population in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who have tested positive for COVID-19 during the survey period from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. \n\n\nThis Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are:\nSarah Walker - University of Oxford, Nuffield Department for Medicine: Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology and Study Chief Investigator\nAnna Seale - University of Warwick, Warwick Medical School: Professor of Public Health; UK Health Security Agency, Data, Analytics and Surveillance: Scientific Advisor\nOur Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey methodology article provides further information around the survey design and how we process data.\nMore information on the strengths and limitations of the data, data uses and users is available in the Coronavirus Infection Survey QMI and the Coronavirus Infection Survey statistical bulletin.\nThere is no source of data that provides a precise count of the number of people who have been infected with coronavirus (COVID-19). This analysis is based on a method that provides our best current estimate of the number of people who have been infected since the survey started. Our method contains several sources of potential bias, which may have affected our estimates.\nThe method assumes first infection episodes identified in the Coronavirus Infection Survey (CIS) data are truly the first time a person had COVID-19. While this will have been (nearly) true at the start of the pandemic, as more people have been infected and then re-infected with COVID-19, an increasing proportion of \"first infection episodes\" will be re-infections where the first infection was not identified in CIS. This means our estimates of first-infection positivity will be inflated (by inclusion of some second or later infections which we were unable to identify as such). Therefore, our current estimates of how many people have had COVID-19 since the start of the survey could be biased upwards. The credible intervals do not allow for this uncertainty.\nOur definition of an infection episode assumes that individuals can test positive for up to 120 days within the same infection. Since the Omicron variants became dominant, we and others have observed a high number of re-infections, many shortly after Delta infections, suggesting that this is less appropriate. As we use the definition of an infection episode to estimate the time people will test positive for, changing the definition to allow for re-infections happening much more quickly after a previous infection will reduce the estimated number of days an individual will test positive for. This will increase the estimates of incidence, meaning our current estimates would be biased downwards.\nInfections before the CIS survey started in the respective UK countries are not included. This means our current estimates will be biased downwards from the true figure, particularly in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland where data collection started later. However, this will not change the shape of the curves noticeably. Estimates of antibody positivity from CIS suggest that around 6% of the England population had COVID-19 before the start of the survey.\nThe beginning and ends of the time series are subject to less information and instability and subject to greater relative uncertainty which may not be fully captured in the credible intervals. We have removed the last 14 days of the series to attempt to mitigate against some of this. The net effect on the bias is unclear.\nWe do not know the exact specificity (percentage of true negatives that test negative) and sensitivity (percentage of true positives that test positive) of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The credible intervals do not adjust for this uncertainty. As this uncertainty is primarily driven by the uncertainty in the sensitivity of the tests, and given the high specificity of the test, true positivity and duration of positivity are both likely to be biased slightly downwards. However, the deconvolution means that the net bias could go in either direction.\nMore information about test sensitivity and specificity is available in our methodology article.\nTo develop the analysis presented in this article further, we plan to apply our updated definition of an episode of infection to the current method. Our updated definition of an episode has been applied to our re-infections analysis, and reflects the shorter time between re-infections that have occurred during the Omicron variants period, compared with earlier variants.\nWe are also developing models to estimate the percentage of people who have had coronavirus (COVID-19) during the study period by age group.\n", "summary": "7 in 10 people in England have had COVID-19\nMore than one in two people in each UK country have had coronavirus (COVID-19) since the start of the Coronavirus Infection Survey.\nBetween 27 April 2020 and 11 February 2022, more than 7 in every 10 people in England (70.7%) are estimated to have had COVID-19.\nIn Northern Ireland, a similar proportion (72.2%) are estimated to have had COVID-19 between 30 June 2020 and 11 February 2022.\nEstimates in other nations vary according to the date the Coronavirus Infection Survey began in that area.\nThe estimated percentage of the community population (those not in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings) that had COVID-19 was:\n - 70.7% of the population (38.5 million people) in England between 27 April 2020 and 11 February 2022.\n - 56.0% of the population (1.7 million people) in Wales between 30 June 2020 and 11 February 2022.\n - 72.2% of the population (1.3 million people) in Northern Ireland between 27 July 2020 and 11 February 2022.\n - 51.5% of the population (2.7 million people) in Scotland between 22 September 2020 and 11 February 2022.\n", "id": 270}, {"document": "The sickness absence rate in the UK in 2021 rose to 2.2%, from a record low of 1.8% in 2020; this is the highest it has been since 2010, when it was also 2.2%.\nAn estimated 149.3 million working days were lost because of sickness or injury in the UK in 2021, equivalent to 4.6 days per worker.\nThe most common reason for sickness absence in 2021 was \"other\" conditions, including accidents, poisonings, diabetes and coronavirus (COVID-19).\nCOVID-19 accounted for nearly one in four of all occurrences of sickness absence in 2021.\nThe groups with the highest rates of sickness absence in 2021 included women, older workers, those with long-term health conditions, people working part-time and people working in caring, leisure and other service occupations.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the sickness absence data in many ways. While the virus may have led to additional sickness absence, measures such as furloughing, social distancing, shielding and increased homeworking helped to reduce other causes of absence in 2020. However, the reduction to the furlough scheme and its eventual end in September 2021, coupled with the decline in homeworking, shielding, social distancing policies, and new COVID-19 variants, led to a rise in sickness absence in 2021 to above pre-pandemic levels.\nMore information on definitions and how these are used in our estimates can be found in the Glossary\nMany people in employment were on furlough during 2020. Furloughed employments, as reported in\u00a0HM Revenue and Customs' Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme statistics,\u00a0increased from the start of the scheme to a peak of 8.9 million employments on 8 May 2020. A year later, in May 2021, only 2.8 million employments were still on furlough and when the scheme ended on 30 September 2021, 1.2 million employments were on furlough.\nThe number of people in employment shielding, that is staying at home because of underlying health conditions, reduced between 2020 and 2021. Labour market statistics show that, on average, 200,000 people were shielding between July and December 2020. This decreased to 173,000 on average between January and June 2021, becoming negligible after this time.\nThis group of people would normally have a higher sickness absence rate than those not shielding. If fewer from this group were present in the workplace in 2020, then they would be contributing less to the number taking days off because of sickness. This could be one explanation for the reduction in the sickness absence rate in 2020. Following this, an increase in the number of these workers returning to work in 2021 could partly explain the increase in rates in 2021.\nHomeworking became more prevalent in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, with\u00a08.4 million people working at home in the reference week\u00a0up from 4.0 million in 2019. This may have had an impact on sickness absences in 2020\u00a0and 2021. For example:\nhomeworking may have allowed people to work when they were a little unwell; they might not have travelled to a workplace to work but felt well enough to work from home\ngovernment restrictions requiring people to observe social distancing and self-isolate, may have led to less exposure to germs and minimised some of the usual sickness absences in 2020\nThe subsequent relaxation of coronavirus restrictions during periods of 2021 and less requirement to work from home, may have contributed to an increase in sickness absence in 2021.\nEstimates showing trends in homeworking and compliance with government guidance such as wearing a face covering, social distancing or self-isolating from March 2020 to April 2022 are available within\u00a0our Public opinions and social trends bulletin.\nThe sickness absence rate (or the percentage of working hours lost because of sickness or injury) generally declined through the 2000s and has remained relatively flat throughout the 2010s, dropping to a record low in 2020. In 2021, the rate increased to 2.2%, the highest it has been since 2010. The increase in 2021 was driven by increases seen between October and December 2021.\nThe number of working days lost because of sickness or injury increased in 2021, to an estimated 149.3 million working days, equivalent to 4.6 days per worker. Caution should be taken when analysing total days lost for 2020 and 2021, because of the impact of furloughed workers and policy during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe main reasons for sickness absence over the time series have been minor illnesses and musculoskeletal problems, but this has changed in the recent periods because of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nIn 2021, \"Other\" conditions (which includes COVID-19) were the most common reasons for sickness absence, accounting for 26.9% of occurrences of sickness absence. This was followed by minor illnesses, at 21.9%, musculoskeletal problems, at 13.4%, and mental health conditions, at 9.8%.\nCOVID-19 accounted for 24.0% of all occurrences of sickness absence in 2021, up from 13.9% in 2020. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) reported that two-thirds of organisations include COVID-19 among the top three reasons of short term absence in 2021.\nSickness absence rates have been consistently lower for men than for women since 1995, with the rates for both sexes generally falling between 1995 and 2020. Men lost 1.8% of their working hours in 2021 (an increase of 0.3 percentage points from 2020) as a result of sickness or injury and women lost 2.6% of their working hours (an increase of 0.3 percentage points from 2020).\nSickness absence rates are higher among older workers as they are more likely to develop health problems. The rate increased for all age groups from 2020 to 2021. In 2021, the sickness absence rate for those aged 65 years and over was the highest on record (at 3.2%).\nIn 2021, as in previous years, workers living in Wales had the highest sickness absence rate (2.8%). Those living in London had the lowest sickness absence rate (1.7%), 0.5 percentage points below the UK average.\nThis can be largely explained by the younger age profile of people and workers living in London and the types of occupations that they do. There is a large concentration of high-skilled jobs in London, which tend to have lower rates of sickness absence.\nIn 2021, sickness absence rates for public and private sector workers were 3.0% and 1.9% respectively, both up 0.3 percentage points from their 2020 rates. Sickness absence rates for public sector workers have been consistently higher than those for private sector workers for every year on record.\nThere are several factors to consider when examining the differences between the public and private sectors, including:\nthere are differences in the types of jobs between the sectors, and some jobs have higher likelihoods of sickness than others\nworkers in the private sector are more likely not to be paid sickness absence than those in the public sector\nthe analysis only counts someone as sick if they work fewer hours than they are contracted for and would exclude someone who makes up lost hours at a later point in the week; individuals in smaller workforces, which are more prominent in the private sector, may be under more pressure to make up any lost hours, but no data are collected on hours made up following sickness absence\nManagers and senior officials (for example, chief executives and financial managers) had the lowest sickness absence rates in 2021, at 1.1%. Workers in caring, leisure and other service occupations had the highest rates, at 3.8%. Occupational groups will have been affected differently by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the ability to work from home would be very different across these groups. This can be seen in our article Which jobs can be done from home? published in July 2021.\nThe sickness absence rate for part-time workers has been consistently higher than the rate for full-time workers. This can be explained in part by higher numbers of women working part-time, as they also tend to have higher rates of sickness absence. The sickness absence rate for part-time workers was 3.1% in 2021, a 0.5 percentage point increase on the previous year. The sickness absence rate for full-time workers was 2.0% in 2021, an increase of 0.3 percentage points on the previous year.\n\nSickness absence in the UK labour market  Dataset | Released 29 April 2022  Annual sickness absence rates of workers in the UK labour market.\n\n\nThe estimates included in this release have been produced using the Labour Force Survey (LFS). They relate to people aged 16 years and over in employment and are for the whole of the UK. Estimates are available from 1995 onwards for most breakdowns. Estimates calculated using the LFS are based on annual averages across quarters for each calendar year: taking an average of the January to March, April to June, July to September and October to December datasets within a calendar year.\nThe total number of days lost is presented in millions, unless otherwise stated.\nThe sickness absence rate is presented as a percentage throughout these analyses.\nThe\u00a0Labour Force Survey (LFS) Quality and Methodology Information (QMI) reports\u00a0contain important information on:\nthe strengths and limitations of the data and how it compares with released data\nthe uses and users of the data\nhow the output was created\nthe quality of the output including the accuracy of the data\nMore information on the quality, methodology and history of the LFS can be found in the\u00a0Labour Force Survey -\u00a0user guidance.\nEstimates of sickness absence at the UK level in 2021 were based on a sample size of approximately 1,000 averaged across the year. There is therefore a limit to how many breakdowns can be made of the data without significantly reducing quality or requiring an element of disclosure control.\nThe numbers quoted throughout this release are based on sample sizes of three or higher. Within the main tables, any estimate based on fewer than three people has been suppressed. In instances where secondary disclosure was possible, the \"Prefers not to say\" category has also been suppressed. Any estimate based on a sample size of between 3 and 25 has been highlighted (with grey shading), to emphasise the potential quality limitation of the estimate. These have been applied as per\u00a0our Measuring and reporting reliability of Labour Force Survey and Annual Population Survey Estimates methodology.\nBecause of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a high number of people in employment were on furlough (away from work which they expect to return to) during 2020 and 2021. This has affected some of the measures of sickness absence; some of the falls seen in 2020 will be because there were fewer people in work, therefore fewer people taking days off because of sickness or injury. However, decreases in furlough in 2021 could have led to higher levels of sickness absence as people return to work.\nThe LFS design is based on interviewing households over five consecutive quarters. Generally, the first of these interviews, called Wave 1, takes place face-to-face, with most subsequent interviews, for Waves 2 to 5, conducted by telephone. During March 2020, we stopped conducting face-to-face interviews, instead switching to using telephone interviewing exclusively for all waves. This initially caused a significant drop in response. New measures have been introduced to improve this, which have increased sample sizes, although they are still below normal LFS sample sizes.\n", "summary": "UK sickness absence rate hit 10-year high in 2021\nThe sickness absence rate (or the percentage of working hours lost because of sickness or injury) in the UK labour market rose to 2.2% in 2021, up from a record low of 1.8% in 2020. This is the highest sickness absence rate since 2010.\nMeasures in place because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic such as the furlough scheme, increased homeworking, social distancing and shielding reduced sickness absence in 2020, but the gradual removal of these measures and emergence of new COVID-19 variants in 2021 led to absences rising above pre-coronavirus levels.\nAn estimated 149.3 million working days were lost because of sickness or injury in the UK in 2021, equivalent to 4.6 days per worker. \u201cOther\u201d conditions (which include COVID-19) overtook minor illnesses as the most common reason for sickness absence for the first time in 2021, with COVID-19 accounting for 24.0% of all occurrences.\nWorkers in caring, leisure and other service occupations had the highest sickness absence rate in 2021, at 3.8%.\nSickness absence increased in all age groups between 2020 and 2021, with sickness absence among workers aged 65 years and over reaching 3.2%, the highest on record.\n", "id": 274}, {"document": "Patterns of crime over the last two years have been substantially affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and government restrictions on social contact. While periods of national lockdown have seen decreases in the incidence of many types of crime, fraud and computer misuse offences have not followed a lockdown-related pattern and have increased substantially. \nSince restrictions were lifted following the third national lockdown in early 2021, police recorded crime data show indications that certain offence types are returning to or exceeding the levels seen before the pandemic. While violence and sexual offences recorded by the police have exceeded pre-pandemic levels, theft offences and robbery remain at a lower level despite increases over the last nine months.\nOverall, Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) estimates provide the best indicator of long-term trends in crime. Estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) for the year ending December 2021 compared with the pre-coronavirus year ending December 2019 [note 1] show:\nan 18% increase in total crime, driven by a 54% increase in fraud and computer misuse offences\na 15% decrease in theft offences\nNew TCSEW data provided insights into phishing, one of the main methods used for committing fraud. Although less than 1% of survey respondents who received a suspected phishing message provided personal details that criminals could use, the scale of phishing messages received every month is likely to translate into a high number of fraud offences. \nPolice recorded crime data give more insight into lower-volume but higher-harm crimes that the survey does not cover or does not capture well. Compared with the year ending December 2020 they show:\nthe number of homicides increased by 14% to 691 offences; this was driven by increases in the April to December 2021 period where levels returned to those seen before the pandemic\na 4% decrease in the number of police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime) and a 5% decrease in offences involving firearms; although these offences increased over the last nine months of the year, levels remained lower than before the pandemic\nCSEW data on sexual assaults are not available for this release making interpreting trends in sexual offences challenging. Police recorded sexual offences rose by 22% to the highest annual figure recorded in England and Wales (183,587 offences). This includes the highest recorded annual number of rape offences to date (67,125 offences). Caution is needed when interpreting these figures as they may reflect a number of factors including the impact of high-profile cases and campaigns on victims\u2019 willingness to report incidents. \n\n!\n\nCrime estimates for the year ending December 2021 best reflect the current extent of crime experienced by the population resident in households (Appendix Table A2). However, new telephone-based survey (TCSEW) estimates are not directly comparable with previous survey (CSEW) estimates because of changes to the sample and questionnaire (see Section 14). Percentage changes are presented using figures adjusted for these differences (Appendix Table A3). \n\n\n\nThe Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) began data collection on 20 May 2020 to capture trends in crime while normal face-to-face interviewing was suspended because of restrictions on social contact during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nAccording to TCSEW estimates, adults aged 18 years and over experienced 12.8 million offences in the year ending December 2021 (Appendix Table 2). This was an 18% increase in estimated levels of crime compared with the year ending December 2019 (Appendix Table 3). There were decreases across a range of individual crime types, particularly theft offences. However, these were offset by rises in fraud and computer misuse offences resulting in an overall increase in crime estimates.\nFor the crime types and population it covers, the face-to-face CSEW is a better indicator of long-term trends than police recorded crime. It is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police or police recording practices. Our comparability report has shown that TCSEW estimates can be directly compared with these long-term CSEW estimates when certain adjustments are applied.\nFurther information on these changes is available in the Measuring the data section.\nThe latest estimates show that approximately 8 in 10 adults did not experience any of the crimes asked about in the TCSEW in the year ending December 2021 (Figure 2). The likelihood of being a victim of crime varies by crime type, with fraud having the highest proportion of victims (9%), followed by computer misuse (4%) and vehicle-related theft (3%).\nThe TCSEW also showed that the likelihood of being a victim of crime varied by demographic characteristics. For more information, see the annual trend and demographic tables.\n\n!\n\nImprovements to recording processes and practices by the police, expansions of the recorded crime collection to include new offences, variations in police activity, more victims reporting crime, and genuine increases in some types of crime, have each made substantial contributions to rises in recorded crime over recent years. This effect has been more pronounced for some crime types. For some types of offence these figures do not provide reliable trends in crime.\n\n\n\nThe police recorded 6 million crimes in England and Wales in the year ending December 2021. This was a similar level to the pre-coronavirus year ending March 2019 and an 8% increase compared with the year ending December 2020. \nTotal police recorded crime saw the lowest number of offences in the first quarter (January to March 2021) of the year ending December 2021 coinciding with a period of national lockdown. However, from April 2021 recorded crime returned to the levels seen before the pandemic (Figure 3). \n\n\nFigure 3: Police recorded crime has returned to similar levels seen before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\nEngland and Wales, quarterly data (April 2017 to December 2021) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nPolice recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 3: Police recorded crime has returned to similar levels seen before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nInformation on case outcomes can be found in Home Office Crime outcomes in England and Wales.\u2003\u2003\nCrime survey and police recorded crime data can be used together to develop a more complete picture of crime (Table 1). The TCSEW data showed increases in fraud and computer misuse and decreases in theft offences compared with the year ending December 2019. Police recorded crime also showed decreases in individual theft offences, such as burglary and vehicle offences, compared with the year ending December 2020.\nThe police recorded 691 homicide offences in the year ending December 2021, a 14% increase compared with the year ending December 2020 (604 offences). This was similar to the number of offences recorded in the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) year ending March 2019 (683 offences). Within this annual figure, the number of homicides was lower during periods of lockdown but there have been increases since April 2021.\nThe rate of homicide in the population remains low at 12 per 1 million people in the year ending December 2021 compared with 10 per 1 million people in the year ending December 2020.\n\n\nFigure 4: Homicide increased by 14% in the latest year \nEngland and Wales, year ending March 2003 to year ending December 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nThe dates shown for the London terrorist attacks in 2005 and 2017, and the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, correspond to when the events occurred, rather than when the homicides were recorded by the police.\nData on homicide offences given in these police recorded crime data will differ from data from the Home Office Homicide Index\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 4: Homicide increased by 14% in the latest year \nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nOf all recorded homicides in the year ending December 2021, the proportion of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was the method of killing increased to 44% compared with 39% in the year ending December 2020.\nFor the latest analysis of information on homicide offences held within the Home Office Homicide Index, see our Homicide in England and Wales: year ending March 2021 article.\nPolice recorded crime provides a better measure than the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) of higher-harm but less common types of violence, such as those involving a knife or sharp instrument (knife-enabled crime).\n\n!\n\nFigures referenced in this section are not directly comparable with those previously published because of a change in knife or sharp instrument data collection practices.\n\n\n\nKnife-enabled crime recorded by the police saw a 4% decrease to 46,950 offences in the year ending December 2021, from 49,152 in the year ending December 2020. This was driven by a 15% decrease in robbery offences to 16,228. \nLevels of knife-enabled crime were lower during periods of lockdown but returned to pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) levels in the April to December 2021 period. Despite this, knife-enabled crime was still 10% lower in the year ending December 2021 compared with the pre-coronavirus year ending March 2019.\n\n\nFigure 5: Knife-enabled crime recorded by the police decreased for the second consecutive year\nEngland and Wales (excluding Greater Manchester Police), year ending March 2011 to year ending December 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nGreater Manchester Police reviewed their recording of offences involving knives or sharp instruments in December 2017 which revealed that they were under-counting these offences. Previous data were not revised at the time and therefore data from Greater Manchester Police are excluded to allow for comparison over time.\nAn adjustment has been made to data prior to the year ending March 2020 for police forces who are now using the NDQIS tool and the total for England and Wales. For more information on the adjustment to the time series and the differences in data collection methods, please see the methodology note Police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments: methodology changes.\nOther selected offences include rape, attempted murder, homicide, and sexual assault.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 5: Knife-enabled crime recorded by the police decreased for the second consecutive year\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nPatterns of knife or sharp instrument offences vary across police force areas [note 1].

This could have been influenced by increases in targeted police action.\nThe Home Office and police forces have continued to roll out a new methodology for identifying recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime). Thirty-six forces have now switched to the National Data Quality Improvement Service (NDIQS) data collection methodology [note 3]. It is aimed that the new methodology will be rolled out to all forces in England and Wales over the next year. Estimates in this release include a combination of both new and old data collection methods. \nFor more information, including the differences in data collection methods, please see our methodology note Police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments, methodology changes and improving data collection blog. \nThe latest provisional admissions data for NHS hospitals in England and Wales reported a 6% decrease in admissions for assault by a sharp object in the year ending December 2021 (to 4,026 admissions) compared with the year ending December 2020.\nData related to stop and searches can be found in the Home Office publication Police powers and procedures.\nPolice recorded offences involving firearms are at their lowest level since the year ending March 2016 at 5,682 (Figure 6). This was a 5% decrease compared with the year ending December 2020 (5,983 offences) and a 17% decrease compared with the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) year ending March 2019 (6,882 offences). \nBroken down by type of weapon, there was a 17% and 23% decrease in offences using handguns (to 1,865 offences) and shotguns (to 445 offences) respectively, while there was a 26% increase in offences using imitation firearms (to 1,819 offences).\n\n\nFigure 6: Police recorded firearms offences are at their lowest level since the year ending March 2016 \nEngland and Wales, year ending March 2003 to year ending December 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nExcludes offences involving the use of conventional air weapons, such as air rifles and offences recorded by British Transport Police.

For data relating to offences involving firearms see Other related tables.\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides the best picture of the overall trend in violent crime.\nEstimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 1.8 million violent offences in the year ending December 2021. \nUsing a comparable dataset adjusted for changes in the sample and questionnaire between the CSEW and TCSEW, there was no statistically significant change in the total number of violent incidents, or the number of victims compared with the year ending December 2019 (Figure 7). \nPolice recorded crime data in the year ending December 2021 showed increases in violence with injury (8% increase to 530,374) and violence without injury (11% increase to 773,878) compared with the year ending December 2020. \nThe increases in police recorded violence with injury offences are reflected in research conducted by the Violence Research Group at Cardiff University. An estimated 146,856 people attended emergency units in England and Wales for treatment of violence-related injury in the year ending December 2021 [note 1]. This is a 23% increase compared with the year ending December 2020 (119,111 people).\nViolence with injury was still lower than the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) year to March 2019 (549,647 offences) but levels of violence without injury had exceeded those seen in the year ending March 2019 (679,161 offences). \nOverall, police recorded violence increased by 13% from 1,780,556 to 2,017,307 in the year ending December 2021 compared with the previous year. The highest increase was seen in stalking and harassment offences, which rose by 19% to 673,129 (excluding controlling and coercive behaviour [note 2]). This increase may be caused by improvements made by police forces in identifying and recording stalking and harassment offences together with an increased confidence in victims coming forward to report these offences.\n\n!\n\nDomestic abuse-related crimes and sexual offences recorded by the police do not provide a reliable measure of trends in these types of crime. Improvements in police recording practices and increased reporting by victims have contributed to increases in recent years. The figures do, however, provide a good measure of the crime-related demand on the police.\n\n\n\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides a more reliable measure of long-term trends in domestic abuse, sexual assault, stalking and harassment. Questions related to these offences were removed from the survey with the move to telephone interviewing from May 2020 because of concerns around confidentiality and respondent safeguarding. As a result, CSEW estimates for these offences are not available for this release. \nPolice recorded crime data, in isolation, do not provide a measure of prevalence to understand the true extent of domestic abuse, sexual assault, stalking and harassment. Therefore, figures presented in this release should be interpreted with caution.\nThe police recorded 895,782 offences (excluding fraud) flagged as domestic abuse-related in the year ending December 2021. This represents a 7% increase from 839,376 offences in the previous year and a 20% increase from 746,219 offences in the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) year ending March 2019. This included 712,584 violence against the person offences flagged as domestic abuse-related, a 7% increase compared with the year ending December 2020. \nSome of this increase may reflect improvements seen in reporting over the last few years. Given this and the absence of domestic abuse survey estimates, we cannot conclude whether there has been an increase in the number of victims of domestic abuse.\nFurther information and data related to domestic abuse can be found in our Domestic abuse in England and Wales overview: November 2021 bulletin. \nHigh levels of non-reporting combined with changes in reporting trends can have a significant impact on sexual offences recorded by the police. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the number of police recorded sexual offences was well below the number of victims estimated by the crime survey, with fewer than one in six victims of rape or assault by penetration reporting the crime to the police. \nThe latest figures may reflect a number of factors, including the impact of high-profile incidents, media coverage and campaigns on people\u2019s willingness to report incidents to the police, as well as a potential increase in the number of victims.\nSexual offences recorded by the police were at the highest level recorded within a 12-month period (183,587 offences) in the year ending December 2021, a 22% increase from the same period in 2020 (Figure 8). Within these annual figures, the number of recorded sexual offences were lower during periods of lockdown but there have been substantial increases since April 2021. \nOf all sexual offences recorded by the police in the year ending December 2021, 37% (67,125) were rape offences. This was a 21% increase from 55,592 in the year ending December 2020. Other sexual offences increased by 22% to 116,462 compared with 95,156 the previous year. \n\n\nFigure 8: Police recorded rape and sexual offences were the highest on record in the year ending December 2021 \nEngland and Wales quarterly data from April 2009 to December 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nOperation Yewtree is the police investigation into allegations of sexual abuse, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 8: Police recorded rape and sexual offences were the highest on record in the year ending December 2021 \nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nFurther data related to sexual offences can be found in our Sexual offences in England and Wales overview: year ending March 2020 bulletin.\nCSEW data on the prevalence of domestic abuse, sexual assault and stalking for the year ending March 2020 can be found in Table S42 in Annual supplementary tables.\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is the most reliable indicator for long-term trends in the more common types of crime experienced by the general population, such as theft. However, police recorded crime data can give reliable indications of trends in some offences involving theft (for example, domestic burglary) that are well-reported and may provide a better measure of short-term trends. \nThere were 2.9 million incidents of theft estimated by the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) for the year ending December 2021 (Appendix Table 2). This was a 15% decrease compared with the year ending December 2019 (Appendix Table 3). This large fall was seen across most sub-categories, with a 42% decrease in \u201ctheft from the person\u201d offences, followed by a 30% decrease in bicycle theft offences and a 21% decrease in vehicle-related theft offences.\nPolice recorded theft offences decreased by 3% to 1.4 million in the year ending December 2021. This decrease was seen across most subcategories: burglary (14%), bicycle theft (8%) and vehicle offences (6%). \nAlthough levels of theft offences increased after restrictions related to the third national lockdown were lifted, recorded theft in the year ending December 2021 remained lower than the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) year ending March 2019 (approximately 2 million offences). \nPolice recorded robbery decreased for the second year to 62,354 offences; this was a 9% decrease compared with the year ending December 2020. This follows the trend of consecutive annual increases seen from the year ending March 2015 to the year ending March 2020. The largest decreases were seen in the London and South East regions, which saw 18% and 20% falls, respectively.\nFraud estimates do not follow the trend of falling victimisation seen in other crime types. Estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 5.2 million fraud offences in the year ending December 2021 (Appendix Table 2), a 41% increase compared with the year ending December 2019 (Appendix Table 3). \nLarge increases were seen in \u201cadvance fee fraud\u201d and \u201cconsumer and retail fraud\u201d. This may indicate fraudsters taking advantage of behavioural changes related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, such as increased online shopping. For example, advance fee fraud offences included scams where victims transferred funds to fraudsters for postal deliveries.\nPhishing is one of the main methods used to commit fraud. Approximately half (53%) of TCSEW respondents reported receiving an email, text or social media message that may have been phishing in the last month (Coronavirus and Crime Table 7). \nOf those who had received phishing messages, 56% had received messages from fraudsters pretending to be delivery companies, 34% from banks, building societies or other financial institutions, and 28% from e-commerce companies. Where respondents had received phishing messages, 3% replied or clicked on a link in the message. Of those who replied or clicked on a link, 14% provided personal information that could be used by fraudsters (equivalent to less than 1% of respondents who received a phishing message).\nFraud offences reported to the police are recorded and collected by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) from Action Fraud and two industry bodies, Cifas and UK Finance. Action Fraud (the public-facing national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre) reported a 15% rise in fraud offences (to 400,763 offences) compared with the year ending December 2020. The data showed a 29% increase in \u201cfinancial investment fraud\u201d offences in the last year (to 22,683 offences) and a 12% rise in \u201cadvance fee payments\u201d (to 51,667 offences).\nNFIB data showed referrals from UK Finance and Cifas (who report instances of fraud where their member organisations have been victims) increased by 78% (to 190,327 offences) and 10% (to 329,442 offences), respectively, compared with the year ending December 2020. These trends need to be interpreted in the context of differences in coverage and fraud types captured by each reporting body.\nThe Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) provides a better indication of the volume of computer misuse offences experienced by the adult population as it captures incidents that go unreported to the police. This can be seen by the large difference in the volume of computer misuse offences between the two sources, which also cannot be compared because of differences in coverage.\nEstimates from the TCSEW showed that computer misuse offences doubled in the year ending December 2021 (to 1.8 million offences) compared with the year ending December 2019. The biggest increase was seen in \u201cUnauthorised access to personal information (including hacking)\u201d offences. This included victims\u2019 details being compromised via large-scale data breaches, and victims\u2019 email or social media accounts being compromised. This increase may correlate with the rise in the number of large-scale data breaches around the world.\nThe National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) also reported a 6% increase in \u201cHacking \u2013 personal\u201d offences referred by Action Fraud (from 4,915 to 5,187 offences) for the year ending December 2021 compared with the previous year. \nOur Nature of crime: fraud and computer misuse datasets hold more in-depth data about these offences from the year ending March 2021.\nThe police recorded 1.5 million incidents of anti-social behaviour (ASB) in the year ending December 2021. This was a 25% decrease compared with the year ending December 2020. \nLevels of ASB incidents were particularly high in the year ending December 2020 because of people reporting breaches of virus restrictions in their local area since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The number of ASB incidents in the year ending December 2021 was similar to that of the pre-coronavirus year ending March 2019. \nThe Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TSCEW) showed that 24% of adults personally witnessed or experienced anti-social behaviour in their area in the last 12 months. \nThe TCSEW includes a measure of harassment that covers adults\u2019 experiences of being insulted, called names, threatened or shouted at in public spaces. Estimates showed that 7% of adults experienced these types of harassment in the year ending December 2021. Where a specific perceived reason for the harassment was given, the most common was because of the coronavirus pandemic (21%), followed by education, income level or job (8%).\nIn the next few months we will be running a user consultation regarding the future transformation work on the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). This consultation will cover future questionnaire content, sample design and modal changes. There will also be sections on violence against women and the 10- to 15-year-olds crime survey. If you would like to review the proposed changes and provide feedback on the recommendations, please subscribe to Office for National Statistics email alerts where you will be notified when the consultation is made available.\n\nCrime in England and Wales: Appendix tables  Dataset | Released on 28 April 2022  Long-term trends in Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) crime, estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) and police recorded crime, by offence type.Crime in England and Wales: coronavirus (COVID-19) and crime tables  Dataset | Released on 28 April 2022  Information from a new module of questions included in the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) around perceptions of crime, the police and anti-social behaviour during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and feelings of safety and experiences of harassment.

For example, advance fee fraud offences included scams where victims transferred funds to fraudsters for \u201cfake\u201d postal deliveries.\nNew TCSEW data provided insights into \u201cphishing\u201d, one of the main methods used for committing fraud. Although less than 1% of survey respondents who received a suspected phishing message provided personal details that criminals could use, the scale of phishing messages received every month is likely to translate into a high number of fraud offences. Around half (53%) of TCSEW respondents reported receiving an email, text or social media message that may have been \u201cphishing\u201d in the last month. Of those who had received phishing messages, 56% had received messages from fraudsters pretending to be delivery companies, 34% from banks, building societies or other financial institutions, and 28% from e-commerce companies.\nOf those who replied or clicked on a link, 14% provided personal information that could be used by fraudsters.\n", "id": 275}, {"document": "Overseas residents made 398,000 visits to the UK in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020; this was 96% fewer than Quarter 2 2019 as travel reduced because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nOverseas residents spent \u00a3218 million on their visits to the UK in Quarter 2 2020; this was 97% less than in Quarter 2 2019.\nUK residents made 939,000 visits abroad in Quarter 2 2020, which was 96% fewer than the corresponding period the previous year and was because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nUK residents spent \u00a3402 million on visits abroad in Quarter 2 2020; this was 98% less than in Quarter 2 2019.\nData collection by the International Passenger Survey (IPS) was suspended for the period covered by this release, so the figures in this relase are based on administrative sources and modelling. \u2003\nTravel and tourism statistics are usually based on the results of the International Passenger Survey (IPS), but the survey was suspended on 16 March 2020 because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. No IPS data will be collected for the period when the survey is not operational. We are working to resume interviewing as soon as it practical and safe to do so. More information will be made available as soon as possible.\nThe figures published in this article, for April to June 2020, are based on administrative sources and modelling, and the methods used are described in Section 6: Data sources and quality. The statisitics have been produced to the highest quality possible, but the methods used have not been subject to full review and scrutiny. Also, we have made assumptions that some previous trends have continued, for example, the proportions of passengers travelling for business or holidays. The results should therefore be viewed with caution. We have produced these estimates to provide users with as much information as possible about international travel over this period. The figures presented for the period April to June 2020 have not been shown to meet the high standards required for designation as National Statistics. \nThe range of variables published here are much more limited than in the regular quarterly publications, and the usual supporting dataset has not been produced. Some cells in the tables presented are not populated because the relevant breakdown was not produced. \nThis article also presents data for the period January to March 2020 in the charts and tables. As IPS survey data were not collected after 16 March 2020, incomplete information was obtained. Every effort was made to ensure the quality of these statisitics, but in the circumstances we cannot be confident that they meet the high standards required for designation as National Statistics. For this reason, the National Statistics status of these statistics for the period January to March 2020 was temporarily suspended under the provisions made for exceptional difficulties encountered in compiling statistics because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nOverseas residents made a total of 398,000 visits to the UK during Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, a decrease of 96% compared with the same period a year earlier, (Figure 1). The large fall is attributable to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with travel restrictions and reluctance to travel becoming widespread.\nExtrapolating from past trends, taking holidays was the most popular reason for visiting the UK in Quarter 2 2020, with 177,000 visits. This was a 96% decrease compared with Quarter 2 2019. Business visits decreased to 85,000, 96% fewer than in 2019. Visits to friends and relatives decreased by 96% to 112,000.\nSimilar trends were observed for different areas of the world. Visits by North American residents decreased by 97% to 40,000, and visits by residents of \u201cother countries\u201d (countries outside of Europe and North America) decreased by 97% to 60,000. Visits by European residents decreased by 96% to 298,000.\nEstimated spending in the UK by overseas visitors decreased by 97% to \u00a3218 million in Quarter 2 2020 when compared with Quarter 2 2019. \nOverseas residents made an estimated 176,000 visits to the UK in June 2020, which was 95% fewer than in June 2019 (Figure 3). Overseas residents spent \u00a360 million on visits to the UK in June 2020, which was 98% less than in June 2019 (Figure 4).\nOverseas residents made an estimated 127,000 visits to the UK in May 2020, which was 96% fewer than in May 2019 (Figure 3).

Overseas residents spent \u00a379 million on visits to the UK in April 2020, which was 96% less than in April 2019 (Figure 4).\nUK residents made 939,000 visits abroad in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, 96% fewer than Quarter 2 2019 (Figure 5). \nUsing modelling to extrapolate from past trends, holidays continued to be the most common reason for UK residents\u2019 visits abroad. In Quarter 2 2020, there were 617,000 holidays; this decreased by 96% when compared with a year previously. Visits to friends or relatives decreased by 96% to 219,000, while business visits decreased by 97% to 87,000. The number of visits for miscellaneous reasons decreased by 97%, although the numbers are smaller.\nThere was a 97% decrease in visits to North America (43,000 visits), and visits to European countries decreased by 96% (745,000 visits). Visits to \u201cother countries\u201d decreased by 96% to 152,000. \nUK residents spent \u00a3402 million during visits abroad in Quarter 2 2020; this was a decrease of 98% when compared with the same period in 2019. \nThere were an estimated 445,000 visits overseas by UK residents in June 2020, which was 95% fewer than in June 2019 (Figure 5). This large fall in visits overseas resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic mirrors the fall in visits to the UK. UK residents spent \u00a3119 million on visits overseas in June 2020, which was 98% fewer than in June 2019 (Figure 6).\nThere were an estimated 275,000 visits overseas by UK residents in May 2020, which was 97% fewer than in May 2019 (Figure 5). UK residents spent \u00a3147 million on visits overseas in May 2020, which was 97% fewer than in May 2019 (Figure 6).\nThere were an estimated 219,000 visits overseas by UK residents in April 2020, which was 97% fewer than in April 2019 (Figure 5). UK residents spent \u00a3136 million on visits overseas in April 2020, which was 97% fewer than in April 2019 (Figure 6).\nThis section describes the methods and sources used to produce the estimates presented in this release. The primary approach used to estimate international visits was to model the relationship between past International Passenger Survey (IPS) estimates and the visits recorded in administrative data that are regularly used to weight the survey data. This means including:\nCivil Aviation Authority (CAA) data\nsea traffic data from the Department for Transport (DfT)\nEurostar passengers\nEurotunnel passengers\nA time series was constructed from 2009 to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020 for the total monthly visits reported in IPS releases (overseas residents visiting the UK and UK residents visiting overseas, combined for all purposes). The administrative data and total visits reported in the IPS differ because of their definitional differences. For example, IPS estimates exclude transit passengers who do not pass through passport control in the UK, while working air crew and certain other categories of passenger are also excluded from the estimates. \nThe ratio of total survey visits over mean of admin arrivals and departures was calculated as the ratio of these two series.\nA regARIMA time series model (including a significant Easter regressor to capture one week either side of Easter) was fitted to the data up to March 2020, and it was used to forecast the ratio between numbers in the administrative data and visits as reported by the IPS.\nThe total number of IPS visits for April to June 2020 was calculated from this forecasted ratio and the totals in the administrative data for arrivals and departures. \nSeparate time series were constructed from 2009 to Quarter 1 2020 for the monthly visits reported by IPS, broken down by residence and purpose.\nThe total for each combination of residence and purpose was divided by total IPS visits to give a proportion for each purpose and residence out of the total visits.\nFor each purpose and residence, a separate time series model was fitted to the data up to March 2020 and used to forecast proportions for April to June 2020.\nThe forecasts were used to produce the estimates for Quarter 2 (Apr to June), with the UK residents\u2019 miscellaneous visits being the residual after the other purpose and residence groups were subtracted from the total. This was also in good agreement with the separately modelled estimate for UK residents and miscellaneous purpose.\nThe overall overseas residents totals were the sum of all purposes for overseas residents, and UK residents totals were the sum of all purposes for UK residents.\nThe next step was to break the estimates down into visits to and from regions of the world. The available administrative data provided the overseas origin or destination port (air, sea or rail) for the immediate journeys to and from the UK. The IPS reports results primarily on the basis of main country visited (or country of residence). IPS data for 2016 to 2019 were used to model the relationship between these two sets of figures, and this was used to model visits to and from the regions of the world for the period April to June 2020.\nInternational travel for this period was more frequent in routes where we normally observe high proportions of overseas residents compared to the totals, such as on the Channel Tunnel and routes outside Europe. As passengers may have chosen to travel by different routes during this time, we assumed that the overall proportion of overseas residents normally observed should be maintained in the estimates. Therefore, the proportion of overseas residents was constrained to the estimate from the time series models. \nThe suspension of the IPS has meant that some important users have utilised other sources to provide spending figures for the period of the survey\u2019s suspension. In our UK trade release, we have taken the following approach: \n\u201cFor Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, we have worked with ONS\u2019s Data Science Campus to create new estimates using alternative data sources. The data sources that have been used include Civil Aviation Authority, Eurotunnel, Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs (CPIH), airline stock figures and aggregated and anonymised foreign-issued card spend processed through Barclays Point-of-Sale (POS) and \u201ccard-not present\u201d channels.\u201d\nIn this release, we have utilised the data produced for the UK trade release to estimate spending in the UK by visiting overseas residents and spending in the UK by overseas visitors. We have applied adjustments to account for the definitional differences between the two outputs.\nA feature of international travel at the start of the coronavirus pandemic was the delayed return of travellers who had been stranded because of the cancellation of their flights. We investigated this phenomenon by computing the expected numbers of UK residents overseas and overseas residents in the UK in mid-March, then looking at day-by-day numbers on flights in March, and then doing the same in April to June. \nFor most routes, and especially departures from the UK, the analysis showed that the numbers of passengers over this period substantially exceeded the numbers that could be expected to be stranded following the start of lockdown. Not all travellers were stranded passengers returning home: a substantial proportion seemed to be those starting their trips overseas after the intial lockdown in March.\nThe estimates presented in this article for April to June 2020 must be treated with particular caution, since the methods used have not been fully scrutinised or tested. \nConfidence intervals have not been provided for the April to June estimates because we would only be able to provide this based on how well the model predicts data already collected by the IPS. The trends observed this year are not like previous years, and therefore stating these confidence intervals would indicate a misleading level of confidence in the predictions, as the assumptions of the model may not be correct.\nThe usual source of travel and tourism statistics, the IPS, has been suspended since 16 March 2020.\nThe estimates presented in this article make the best use of the available data and methods to produce estimates of international visits and spending. However, as noted, the methods are new and the results should be treated with caution. It has not been possible to produce the full range of variables normally presented in the quarterly publication.\nTravel and tourism statistics are usually based on the results of the International Passenger Survey (IPS), but the survey was suspended on 16 March 2020 because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. No IPS data will be collected for the period when the survey is not operational. We are working to resume interviewing as soon as it practical and safe to do so. More information will be made available as soon as possible.\n", "summary": "Overseas travel in spring 2020 was down 96% from the same time last year\nThe number of visits abroad made by UK residents in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020 dropped 96% compared with the same time the previous year.\nUK residents made fewer than 1 million (939,000) trips abroad in the three months to June 2020, a substantial decrease that was largely because the country was under lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).\nThe number of overseas residents travelling to the UK also decreased dramatically in Quarter 2 compared with the same time in 2019. Residents from abroad made 398,000 visits to the UK between April and June 2020, which was also a 96% decrease on the previous year.\nThe amount of money spent by overseas residents on visits to the UK dropped 97% compared with Quarter 2 2019, to \u00a3218 million, while UK residents spent 98% less on travel abroad compared with the same time the previous year.\nData collection by the International Passenger Survey (IPS) was suspended for the period covered by this release, so the figures are based on administrative sources and modelling.\n", "id": 280}, {"document": "Those in the North West region of England had the highest proportion of adults reporting they were living under highest coronavirus alert level restrictions, with nearly 8 in 10 (77%) adults living under Tier 3.\nThis week, around 7 in 10 (71%) adults in Great Britain strongly supported or tended to support the use of targeted lockdown measures for local areas affected by coronavirus outbreaks; this percentage has been declining since the end of September (86% over the period 24 to 27 September 2020).\nA lower percentage of those living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 (37% and 34% respectively) reported that they had enough information about government plans to manage the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, compared with nearly half (45%) of those in Tier 1.\nLess than a quarter (24%) of adults reported that they were in direct physical contact with at least one other person indoors, including settings such as the home, caf\u00e9s, pubs or restaurants in the last 24 hours, excluding those in their household or support bubble.\nThis week, life satisfaction (6.5) and worthwhile (7.2) scores were at their lowest since our survey began at the end of March and in comparison to pre-pandemic levels in February 2020, and happiness scores continued to decrease for the third week in a row (6.7).\n\n!\n\nOn Saturday 31 October, the UK government announced a second national lockdown for England, which started on 5 November.

Results from this week are based on 4,111 responding adults (68% response rate).\nIt contains breakdowns of results by country and English regions, including self-reported local COVID alert levels in England, as well as those in self-reported local lockdown areas in Scotland, and those in \"firebreak\" lockdown in Wales. The new increased survey sample size will allow us to explore additional breakdowns by various characteristics in future publications.

This week we asked people which COVID alert level or \"tier\" they believed their area was under. The definition of local COVID restrictions is included in Section 10: Glossary.\nThis week, nearly half of adults (46%) in England reported they were in Tier 1, while nearly 4 in 10 (35%) reported they were in Tier 2, and more than 1 in 10 (14%) in Tier 3, the remaining 5% did not know or were unsure.\nThose in the North West region had the highest proportion of adults reporting they were living under the highest restrictions, with nearly 8 in 10 (77%) adults living under Tier 3.\nThe region with the highest proportion of adults reporting living under Tier 2 restrictions was the North East, with 95%, followed by London (90%). The South West had the highest proportion of people reporting they were living in the lowest level of restrictions, with 93% under Tier 1, followed by the South East (91%).\nThis week, around 7 in 10 (71%) adults in Great Britain strongly supported or tended to support the use of targeted lockdown measures for local areas affected by coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks. This is the same percentage as last week and has been declining since the end of September (86% over the period 24 to 27 September).\nA lower percentage of adults supported the use of targeted lockdown measures in Tier 3 (65%) compared with those in Tier 2 and Tier 1 (70% and 76% respectively). In Wales, 70% of adults supported targeted lockdown measures, and for those in local lockdown in Scotland, 80% supported this.\nWhen asked where they looked for information about the restrictions in their area, nearly 6 in 10 (59%) adults in England referred to television news, while 37% referred to online or print news sources and 34% to the NHS COVID app.\nNearly 8 in 10 (77%) adults in England said that it was easy or very easy to find out about the alert levels in their area, while 5% found it difficult or very difficult.\nA lower percentage of those living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 (37% and 34% respectively) reported that they had enough information about government plans to manage the coronavirus pandemic, compared with nearly half (45%) of those in Tier 1.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

There was no statistically significant difference in avoiding contact, social distancing, handwashing and use of face-coverings between Tiers, regions and countries.\n\n!\n\nOfficial guidance varies across England, Wales and Scotland. \n\n\n\n\u201cRule of six\u201d measures are in place to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Official guidance on social gathering varies by local COVID alert level in England, and across Wales and Scotland. \nThe rule of six applies both indoors and outdoors for Tier 1. For those in Tier 2, people are not allowed to meet with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, whilst the rule of six applies outdoors. For Tier 3, people are not allowed to meet up with anyone outside their household or support bubble both indoors and outdoors.\nA lower proportion of adults in Tier 3 and Tier 2 (62% and 63% respectively) said they strongly support or tend to support the rule of six measures, compared with 72% in Tier 1.\nAround half of adults (51%) in Tier 3 reported that the rule of six measures were very simple or simple, a lower percentage than those in Tier 1 and Tier 2 (67% and 59% respectively). \nUnder the local COVID Alert System, different rules applied in different parts of the country for meeting up with others outside their household or support bubble.\nThis week, we asked adults about the rules that applied where they live. In Tier 1, 89% of adults identified with the rule that people must not meet in groups larger than six indoors.\nIn Tier 2 and Tier 3, the majority of adults (73% and 80% respectively) identified with the rule that people must not meet indoors with others from outside their household. \nThis week, people were asked to think of the largest group they had met up with indoors (excluding a work or education setting) in the past seven days, including themselves. It is important to note that this group size could include people (partially or solely) from within an individual's household and/or support bubble. Therefore it should not be considered a precise measure of compliance with government guidance.\nThis week, 19% of those in Tier 2 and 18% in Tier 3 had not met up with another household, compared with 6% of those in Tier 1. Among those who had met up with another household, a lower percentage in Tier 2 and 3 (71% and 70% respectively) reported meeting up with friends and family compared with 83% in Tier 1.\nIn Tier 1, the only local COVID alert level where rule of six guidance for meeting indoors applied, less than 1 in 10 (5%) adults said they had met up indoors with a group of more than six people including themselves in the past seven days. Among those, 6% met up with only people from their household.\nAmong those in Tier 1 who met up with more than six people, and the group included people from outside their household, more than half (52%) met up for one of the following reasons: funeral, worship service, sports or exercise. The remaining 44% met up with friends and family, or for other reasons. \nThis week, respondents were asked to think about when they have had direct physical contact with people outside of their household or support bubble in the last 24 hours. Examples of direct physical contact may include shaking or holding hands, hugging, and making contact when passing objects. \nLess than a quarter (24%) of adults reported that they were in direct physical contact with at least one other person indoors, including settings such as the home, caf\u00e9s, pubs or restaurants in the last 24 hours, excluding those in their household or support bubble.\nMore than 9 in 10 (94%) adults in Great Britain said they had left their home for any reason in the past seven days. A lower percentage (92%) of those in Tier 3 left home in the past seven days, compared with those in Tier 2 and Tier 1 (94% and 96% respectively).\nAmong those who left their home in the past seven days, a lower percentage (8%) of those living in Tier 3 areas met up with people in a personal place compared with those in Tier 1 and 2 (27% and 10% respectively). Similarly, a lower percentage of those in Tier 3 reported leaving home to eat or drink at a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bar or pub, at 20% compared with 29% in Tier 1 and 26% in Tier 2.\nA similar percentage of adults reported that they are very or somewhat worried about the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on their life right now across each of the local COVID alert levels (76% in Tier 1, 77% in Tier 2 and 78% in Tier 3).\nHowever, there were some differences in concerns reported between the local COVID alert levels. The concerns with the largest difference between those in Tier 3 compared with those in Tier 1 were:\nlack of freedom and independence (Tier 3: 68% compared with Tier 1: 57%)\nwell-being (for example, boredom, loneliness, anxiety and stress) (Tier 3: 57% compared with Tier 1: 50%)\nlife events (for example, weddings and funerals) (Tier 3: 48% compared with Tier 1: 41%)\nrelationships (Tier 3: 29% compared with Tier 1: 23%)\nThis week, life satisfaction scores (6.5) and worthwhile (7.2) scores were at their lowest since our survey began at the end of March and in comparison with pre-pandemic levels in February 2020, and happiness scores continue to decrease for the third week in a row (6.7). The recent worsening of life satisfaction, happiness and feelings that things done in life are worthwhile could in part be explained by seasonal variation. A technical report on \u00a0Personal well-being quarterly estimates found that, on average, happiness scores decrease by 1.0% between Quarter 3 (July to September) and Quarter 4 (October to December). The technical report found some worsening to all four personal well-being scores with the greatest impact being to average scores of happiness and anxiety.\nGreat Britain, March to October 2020\nThis week, around half of working adults (51%) reported that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was affecting their work. A similar percentage of working adults reported travelling to work (exclusively, and in combination with working from home), in each of the local COVID alert tiers: 57% in Tier 1, 52% in Tier 2 and 61% in Tier 3.\nA higher percentage of those in Tier 2 (44%) reported that they had worked from home in the past seven days, compared with those in Tier 1 and Tier 3 (both 35% respectively).\nAmong those that had worked from home in the past seven days, 30% of those in Tier 3 said the reason they had worked from home is because they live in a local lockdown area and have been advised to work from home, compared with 8% in Tier 2.\nIn London, 60% of working adults reported working from home in the past seven days - a higher percentage compared with adults who had worked from home in the North East (23%).\nMore than half (56%) of working adults in Wales reported not being able to work from home, compared with 19% of those living in London. \nOfficial estimates of labour market participation can be found in the\u00a0Labour market overview.\n\nCoronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain Dataset | Released 6 November 2020 Indicators from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) to understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain.

Therefore, the price data feeding into the September 2020 UK HPI will begin reflecting those agreements that occurred after the tax changes took place.\nBecause of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on both the number and supply of housing transactions, we might see larger revisions to the published HPI estimates than usual.

The beginning of 2020 saw a pickup in annual growth in the housing market before the coronavirus restrictions were put in place at the end of March 2020.\nPrice variations at the beginning of 2020 may reflect the unusual conditions in the housing market at the time. People were advised not to move house during the tightest restrictions in April and May. As such, property transactions completed during that time may have been more concentrated than usual among those without complicating factors, such as a chain. For example, first-time buyers \u2013 typically at the lower end of the price scale \u2013 may have been freer to complete transactions than former owner occupiers, who may have had to co-ordinate multiple sales during lockdown.\nRecent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations.\nPent-up demand may have contributed towards an increase in house prices. The Bank of England's Money and Credit September 2020 release reported that mortgage approvals for house purchases (an indicator of future lending) increased further in September 2020 to 91,500, the highest since September 2007.\nThe pandemic may have also caused house buyers to reassess their housing preferences. In our UK HPI data, we have seen the average price of detached properties increase by 6.2% in the year to September, in comparison to flats and maisonettes increasing by 2.0% over the same period.\nOn 8 July 2020, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a suspension of the tax paid on property purchases with immediate effect in England and Northern Ireland, coming into effect slightly later on 15 July in Scotland and 27 July in Wales. In England and Northern Ireland, properties up to the value of \u00a3500,000 would incur no tax, while the thresholds for Scotland and Wales were \u00a3250,000. The tax holiday is due to end on 31 March 2021 across the whole of the UK.

Official OBR estimates (XLS, 201KB) published on 21 August 2020 indicate that the \u00a3214.9 billion borrowed by the public sector in the financial year-to-October 2020 could reach \u00a3372.2 billion by the end of March 2021.

We will work with HMRC with the intention of fully incorporating these forecasts in the December 2020 Public sector finances release (published 22 January 2021). \nIn total, over 40 schemes have been announced by the UK government and the devolved administrations to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic. In this section we list the largest of the active schemes by implementation status within the public sector finances. More details on the impact of the pandemic on the public sector finances are provided in Section 11 of this release and the accompanying Recent and upcoming changes to public sector finances, October 2020 article. \nSchemes fully recorded in compliance with existing international statistical guidance are:\nCOVID-19 Corporate Financing Facility\nCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)\nSelf-employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS)\nEat Out to Help Out\nsome subsidies paid out to businesses\nOn 5 November 2020, the government announced the extension of its current job furlough schemes CJRS and SEISS to the end of March 2021. \nThe following schemes are partially or not yet implemented in the public sector finance statistics:\nCoronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme\nCoronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme\nBounce Back Loan Scheme\nFuture Fund\nEmergency Measures Agreements for train operating companies\nTrade Credit Reinsurance Scheme\nFinally, some schemes have been announced but relate to future periods. This category includes cases where the scheme may be open for applications, but no payments have yet been made. This group includes the following schemes:\nJob Support Scheme (JSS)\nLocal Restrictions Support Grant\nIn October 2020, the public sector spent more money than it received in taxes and other income, requiring it to borrow \u00a322.3 billion, \u00a310.8 billion more than it borrowed in October 2019.\nTable 1 summarises the components of public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks) in October 2020 and compares them with the equivalent measures in the same month a year earlier. Additionally, the table presents estimates of the borrowing of public sector banks and the full public sector net borrowing measure.\n\n!\n\nBorrowing estimates in the current financial year (April to October 2020) are subject to more uncertainty than usual as a result of the challenges we face in collecting data during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and because some estimates are based on official projections that are more uncertain than usual. \n\n\n\nCentral government is the largest sub-sector of the public sector. Of the \u00a322.3 billion borrowed by the public sector in October 2020, \u00a318.9 billion was borrowed by central government. \nIn October 2020, central government receipts were estimated to have fallen by \u00a31.7 billion compared with October 2019 to \u00a358.8 billion, including \u00a339.7 billion in tax receipts. In the most recent months, tax receipts recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis are always subject to some uncertainty, as many taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT), Corporation Tax and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Income Tax contain some forecast cash receipts data and are liable to revision when actual cash receipts data are received. \nCentral government bodies spent \u00a375.1 billion in October 2020, \u00a38.3 billion more than in October 2019. Of this, \u00a371.3 billion was spent on day-to-day activities (often referred to as current expenditure), such as:\nproviding services and grants (for example, related to education, defence, and health and social care) \u2013 including the current job furlough schemes\npayment of social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, Child Benefit and Statutory Maternity Pay)\npayment of the interest on the government\u2019s outstanding debt\nThe remaining \u00a33.8 billion was spent on capital investment such as infrastructure.\nCentral government departments spent \u00a36.3 billion more on goods and services in October 2020 than in October 2019, including \u00a35.4 billion more on procurement and \u00a31.1 billion more on pay. These increases partially reflect the expenditure by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), devolved administrations and other departments in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn October 2020, central government paid \u00a34.3 billion in subsidies to businesses and households. These payments included \u00a31.3 billion as a part of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and \u00a30.3 billion as part of the Self Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). On 5 November 2020, the government announced the extension of both its job furlough schemes to the end of March 2021. \nInterest payments on the government\u2019s outstanding debt were \u00a32.0 billion in October 2020, \u00a34.4 billion less than in October 2019. Changes in debt interest are largely a result of movements in the Retail Prices Index to which index-linked bonds are pegged. \nBoth local government and public corporations data for October 2020 are initial estimates, largely based on the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR\u2019s) Coronavirus Reference Scenario (14 July 2020) and Fiscal Sustainability Report (July 2020), which will be revised when further information is available.\nSubsidies paid out to businesses as part of the Coronavirus Small Business Grant Fund, the Coronavirus Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund, the Coronavirus Local Authority Discretionary Grants, and similar schemes in devolved administrations, are included based on administrative data published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) and by the Scottish and Welsh Governments.\nCurrent and capital transfers between these sub-sectors and central government are based on administrative data supplied by HM Treasury and have no impact at the public sector level.\nIn the current financial year to October 2020, the public sector borrowed \u00a3214.9 billion, \u00a3169.1 billion more than in the same period last year. \nThis substantial increase largely reflects the impact of the pandemic on the public finances, with the furlough schemes (CJRS and SEISS) alone adding \u00a354.4 billion to borrowing in the financial year-to-October 2020.\nCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) payments on an accrued (or national accounts) basis for the period March to October 2020 are based on HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) estimates. SEISS payments are currently recorded on a cash basis, reflecting HMRC coronavirus statistics. \nDuring August 2020, the government ran its Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which offered a discount to diners. This discount, provisionally estimated at \u00a30.5 billion was reimbursed to participating businesses by HMRC and, like CJRS and SEISS, is recorded as subsidy paid by central government. \nFurther, on 8 July 2020, the government announced that it would introduce a temporary reduction of VAT rate in certain hospitality sectors from 15 July 2020 to 12 January 2021, subsequently extended to 31 March 2022. \nTable 2 summarises the components of public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks) in the financial year-to-October 2020 and compares them with the equivalent measures in the same period a year earlier. Additionally, the table presents estimates of the borrowing of public sector banks and the full public sector net borrowing measure.\nBorrowing had generally been falling since its peak in the financial year ending (FYE) 2010. However, the \u00a356.1 billion borrowed in the latest full financial year (April 2019 to March 2020) was \u00a317.1 billion more in the previous financial year, largely because of the impact of the pandemic evident from March 2020. \nThe borrowing estimates presented in this bulletin are not adjusted for inflation. We recommend that users consider borrowing as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) when analysing its movements over a long period. \nThe central government net cash requirement (CGNCR) excluding UK Asset Resolution Ltd and Network Rail is the amount of cash needed immediately for the UK government to meet its obligations. To obtain cash, the UK government sells financial instruments, gilts or Treasury Bills. \nThe amount of cash required will be affected by changes in the timing of tax payments by individuals and businesses but does not depend on forecast tax receipts in the same way as our accrued (or national accounts) based measures.\nThe CGNCR consequently contains the most timely information and is less susceptible to revision. However, as for any cash measure, the CGNCR does not reflect the overall amount for which the government is liable or the point at which any liability is incurred \u2013 it only reflects when cash is received and spent. \nOn 20 March 2020, the government introduced a Value Added Tax (VAT) payment deferral policy to support UK business during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by enabling them to pay Value Added Tax (VAT) due between 20 March and 30 June 2020 at a later date (though before 31 March 2022). This policy has substantially lowered VAT cash receipts over this four-month period.\nTables 3 and 4 demonstrate how CGNCR is calculated from cash receipts and cash outlays. This presentation focuses on the central government\u2019s own account and excludes cash payments to both local government and public non-financial corporations. \nOn the same day that we release the public sector finances, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) publishes a Summary of HMRC tax receipts, National Insurance contributions (NICs), tax credit expenditure and Child Benefit for the UK containing a detailed list of cash receipts.\nPublic sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) rose by \u00a3276.3 billion in the first seven months of the financial year to reach \u00a32,076.8 billion at the end of October 2020, \u00a3283.8 billion more than in October 2019.\nThe extra funding required to support government coronavirus support schemes combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) have all helped push public sector net debt as a ratio of GDP to levels last seen in the early 1960s. Public Sector Net Debt (excluding public sector banks) at the end of October 2020 was equivalent to 100.8% of GDP. \nDebt represents the amount of money owed by the public sector to the private sector and is largely made up of gilts (or bonds) issued to investors by central government. \nAt the end of October 2020, there was \u00a31,774.9 billion of central government gilts in circulation (including those held by the Bank of England (BoE) Asset Purchase Facility Fund). These gilts are auctioned by the Debt Management Office (DMO), on behalf of central government in accordance with its financing remit.\nThere has been a substantial month-on-month increase in gilts issuance at face (or redemption) value in the current financial year, partially reflecting the need for extra funding to support government coronavirus (COVID-19) support schemes and to compensate for the fall in tax revenue.\nThe Bank of England (BoE)\u2019s contribution to debt is largely a result of its quantitative easing activities via the BoE Asset Purchase Facility Fund (APF) and Term Funding Schemes (TFS). \nIf we were to remove the temporary debt impact of these schemes along with the other transactions relating to the normal operations of the BoE, public sector net debt excluding public sector banks (PSND ex) at the end of October 2020 would reduce by \u00a3232.9 billion (or 11.3 percentage points of GDP) to \u00a31,843.9 billion (or 89.5% of GDP). \nGilts are the primary financial instrument purchased under the APF. At the end of October 2020, the gilt holdings of the APF were \u00a3584.8 billion at face (or redemption) value, an increase of \u00a315.6 billion compared with a month earlier. Following a government announcement on 5 November 2020, the gilt holdings of the APF are currently capped at \u00a3875 billion.\nThe estimated impact of the APF\u2019s gilt holdings on debt currently stands at \u00a3107.8 billion, representing the difference between the value of the reserves created to purchase gilts (or market value of the gilts) and the face (or redemption) value of the gilts purchased. \nIn this case, it is not the gilt holdings themselves that contribute to debt but the difference in the valuations for these assets. The final debt impact of the APF depends on the disposal of these financial instruments at the end of the scheme (more specifically the price received at their re-sale compared with their purchase price).\nCorporate bond purchases under the APF umbrella have been on a smaller scale than gilt purchases. The total corporate bond holdings at end of October 2020 stood at \u00a320.1 billion, adding an equivalent amount to the level of debt. \nThe Term Funding Schemes aim to reinforce the transmission of Bank Rate cuts to those interest rates faced by households and businesses.\nThe public sector balance sheet contains a liability as a result of the creation of the central bank reserves and an asset as a result of the loans to TFS (and TFSME) participants\nAt the end of October 2020, TFS loan liability stood at \u00a370.7 billion and TFSME loan liability stood at \u00a348.5 billion making a combined liability of \u00a3119.2 billion, adding an equivalent amount to the level of debt. \nAssets purchased under the TFS and TFSME fall outside the boundary of PSNDex: users who are interested in wider measures of the public sector balance sheet may find estimates of Public Sector Net Financial Liabilities (PSNFL) of interest. \nThe data for the latest months of every release contain a degree of forecasts; subsequently, these are replaced by improved forecasts as further data are made available, and finally by outturn data. \nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a substantial impact on both tax receipts and expenditure. These impacts are likely to be revised further as the full effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the public finances continue to become clearer.\nThe revisions presented in this section are largely the result of new tax and expenditure data received from our data suppliers. \nTable 5A shows the revisions to net borrowing presented in this bulletin compared with those presented in the previous bulletin (published on 21 October 2020). \nTable 5B shows the revisions to public sector net debt and net cash requirement presented in this bulletin compared with those presented in the previous bulletin (published on 21 October 2020). \nThis month we have reduced our previous estimate of borrowing in the financial year-to-September 2020 by \u00a315.9 billion, largely because of a \u00a35.7 billion increase to the previous estimates of Value Added Tax (VAT) receipts and a \u00a36.9 billion reduction to the previous estimates of expenditure on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS ) (recorded as a subsidy paid by central government). \nVAT receipts for any month are normally recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis by time-adjusting the average cash receipts expected in the following three months. This means that, for example, VAT receipts on an accrued basis in October depend on forecast cash receipts for November, December and January. These are updated as actual receipts become known. \nVAT cash receipts are currently substantially outperforming those estimated in the OBR\u2019s Fiscal Sustainability Report (FSR) and summer economic update monthly profiles \u2013 21 August 2020 (XLS, 201KB) on which our current forecasts are based. In November 2020 HMRC, ONS, HMT and the OBR determined that an exceptional adjustments would be applied to the estimates of accrued VAT receipts for August, September and October 2020. \nThese exceptional adjustments are needed because cash receipts in recent months have been higher than was anticipated in the OBR forecasts. We will continue to review and apply adjustments to future months as necessary. \nSection 11 explains the challenges of measuring the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on tax receipts and discusses the recording of tax receipts in some detail.\nThis month we have reduced our previous estimate of CJRS payments on an accrued (or national accounts) basis for the period March to October 2020. \nPreviously, data for the period March to June were based on HMRC\u2019s initial estimates while data for the period July to September were based on OBR projections. These estimates have been replaced with updated HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) estimates. \nTable 6 shows how each element of the public sector contributes to the revisions in borrowing compared with our previous publication (21 October 2020). The table presents revisions to both the financial year-to-September 2020 and to September 2020 alone.\nThis month we have increased our previous estimate of borrowing in the financial year ending (FYE) 2020 by \u00a31.5 billion, largely because of a \u00a32.1 billion reduction to the previous estimate of central government tax receipts and National Insurance contributions in this period.\nOn 5 November 2020, HMRC published their Trust Statement and Annual Report and Accounts (PDF, 16.2MB) . This regular exercise results in adjustments to previously published data for the period April 2019 to March 2020.\nFurther, this month we reduced our previous estimate of expenditure on current grants paid by central government to the private sector and rest of the world by \u00a30.7 billion as new data replaced previous estimates.\nThis month we have reduced our previously published estimate of debt at the end of September 2020 by \u00a31.2 billion to \u00a32,058.5 billion. This was largely because of the reclassification of Registered Housing Associations in Northern Ireland with effect from August to the private non-financial corporations subsector, reducing public corporations\u2019 net debt by \u00a31.0 billion at the end of August and September 2020. \nThis month we have updated our estimate of GDP in Quarter 3 (July to Sept ) 2020 based on the published GDP first quarterly estimate, UK: July to September 2020, increasing our previous estimate, based on Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projections, by \u00a343.2 billion.\nAs a result, we have reduced our estimate of debt as a percentage of GDP at the end of September 2020 by 2.3 percentage points, from the 103.5% published last month to 103.5%. \nFurther, as a result of this increase in GDP, we have reduced our ratio of debt to GDP from January 2020 to date. We have published an article that explains how estimates of GDP are used to present debt and other headline measures.\nEstimates of the net debt of public sector banks are derived from the balance sheet of these organisations, supplied to us by the Bank of England twice annually.\nThis month we have received a balance sheet covering the period January to June 2020 for the first time, reducing our previous estimate of the net debt of the public sector banks by \u00a320.6 billion at the end of June 2020 and increasing our corresponding estimates of net cash requirement by \u00a31.9 billion in each month from January 2020.\nThese data have enabled us to improve previous estimates of debt and to inform our current estimates beyond June 2020. \n\nPublic sector finances borrowing by sub-sector Dataset | Released 20 November 2020 An extended breakdown of public sector borrowing in a matrix format and estimates of total managed expenditure (TME).

That is, we attempt to record receipts at the point where the liability arose, rather than when the tax is actually paid. \nThis means that accruals-based tax receipts for the current period depend on information from both current cash payments and on projections of future tax receipts, which are \u201caccrued\u201d (or time-adjusted ) back to the current month. For this purpose, we use official projections of future cash receipts, produced by the OBR. \nExpectations of future tax receipts used in our accrued estimates are based on those published in the OBR\u2019s Fiscal Sustainability Report (FSR) and summer economic update monthly profiles \u2013 21 August 2020 (XLS, 201KB).\nThese projections will be superseded with official forecasts published by OBR on Wednesday 25 November 2020 in their Economic and fiscal outlook \u2013 November 2020. We will work with HMRC with the intention of fully incorporating these forecasts in the December 2020 Public sector finances (published 22 January 2021).\nThe ONS and HM Treasury have been working with both HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and OBR to determine whether there is enough information to make exceptional adjustments that estimate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. \nWhere data are available, we have adjusted the recording of accrued tax receipts (on a national accounts basis) for October and earlier periods. These exceptional adjustments, and their underlying assumptions, will be revisited as more information becomes available. \nPay As You Earn (PAYE) Income Tax is normally recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis by time-adjusting cash receipts using a one-month lag, which means that, for example, accrued PAYE receipts for October are based on forecast November cash receipts. \nThe amount of cash received for PAYE Income Tax in October 2020 was lower than usual, with much of that weakness likely attributable to lower earnings and employment and non-payment of liabilities. October 2020 receipts recorded on an accrued basis are estimated based on the OBR\u2019s FSR, but with some additional adjustments as described below.\nWe currently assume that most non-paid tax due between April and October 2020 will still be paid but in a later period than originally expected. We have included a 7% adjustment to reduce expected PAYE receipts on a national accounts basis to account for possible non-payment of PAYE. This assumption is based on the information set out on tax debts and losses in HMRC\u2019s annual report and accounts, and it is based on average losses for the most recent three years of data.\nIn estimating PAYE receipts on an accrued basis for October 2020, we have used additional cash receipts information for May to October 2020 to inform a judgement on the repayment of arrears (or debt) in June to October 2020. We have also included an upward adjustment for October because PAYE receipts in recent months have been notably higher than was anticipated in the OBR\u2019s estimates published on 21 August 2020.\nValue Added Tax (VAT) data for any month are normally recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis by time-adjusting the average cash receipts expected in the following three months. This means that, for example, VAT receipts on an accrued basis in October depend on forecast cash receipts for November, December and January. These are updated as actual receipts become known.\nThe government announced a deferral scheme for VAT payments, enabling UK businesses to pay VAT due between 20 March and 30 June 2020 at a later date. As a result, cash VAT receipts are lower than usual in this period.\nThe initial assumption is that all the deferred tax owed will still be paid, but in a later period than originally expected, as is permitted under the deferral scheme. We have therefore made an exceptional adjustment to prevent the effects of the deferral scheme on VAT receipts from affecting accrued receipts. \nReceipts forecasts are based on the OBR\u2019s FSR, adjusted to account for the impacts of the deferral scheme. These profiles do not yet consider the announcement on 24 September 2020 that enables companies to opt to spread repayments of deferred VAT across the financial year ending 2022. \nThe existence of this deferral assumption within accrued VAT means that they are subject to revision once further intelligence is gathered on deferred VAT.\nVAT cash receipts are currently substantially outperforming those estimated in OBR\u2019s Fiscal Sustainability Report (FSR) and summer economic update monthly profiles \u2013 21 August 2020 (XLS, 201KB) on which our current forecasts are based. In November 2020 HMRC, ONS, HMT and OBR determined that an exceptional adjustment would be applied to the estimates of accrued VAT receipts for August, September and October 2020. These exceptional adjustments are needed because cash receipts in recent months have been higher than was anticipated in the OBR forecasts. We will continue to review and apply adjustments to future months as necessary.\nVAT on an accrued basis should be considered as provisional from December 2019 onwards until a final determination has been made on the deferrals.\nThere are not enough data available yet on which to estimate the amount of VAT that will not be paid because of lower economic activity or businesses ceasing to trade. \nCorporation Tax data for any month are normally recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis by time-adjusting cash receipts for the subsequent 2 to 21 months, depending on the profits of the company. \nAs with PAYE and VAT, estimates of future months\u2019 cash receipts are currently based on the OBR\u2019s FSR. We are not yet able to estimate the amount of Corporation Tax that will not be paid, for example, because of reduced trading activity leading to lower profits, firms deferring tax payments to a future date or firms going out of business. \nThe FSR implicitly includes an element of non-payment through calibration to outturn receipts observed to mid-June 2020.\nThe national accounts estimate of accrued Corporation Tax relies heavily on forecast cash receipts. However, in making these forecasts, there remains uncertainty regarding the amount of Corporation Tax revenue that may never be received. Both cash receipts and accrued receipts should be viewed together for additional context.\nAs with the taxes outlined earlier, estimates of future months\u2019 Air Passenger Duty (APD) cash receipts are currently based on the OBR\u2019s FSR.\nIn estimating APD receipts on an accrued (or national accounts) basis for February to September 2020, we have used additional cash receipts information up to and including October 2020 to inform a judgement on the repayment of arrears.\nAs with the taxes outlined earlier, estimates of future months\u2019 alcohol cash receipts are currently based on the OBR\u2019s FSR.\nIn estimating alcohol receipts on an accrued (or national accounts) basis for February to September 2020, we have used additional cash receipts information up to and including October 2020 to inform a judgement on the repayment of arrears.\nOur estimates of National Non-domestic Rates (or business rates) in the current financial year reflect the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government's (MHCLG) initial estimate of impact of the coronavirus pandemic and extended reliefs. These numbers are provisional and may be revised when further information becomes available. \nLimited information has meant that those taxes like Council Tax, not specifically profiled in OBR\u2019s FSR may be overestimated. Such taxes will be reviewed over the coming months when more information becomes available.\n", "summary": "Public borrowing in October was double the previous year but remained below market expectation\nUK borrowing was \u00a322.3 billion in October 2020, nearly double the \u00a311.5 billion borrowed in October 2019 and substantially less than the \u00a330 billion market expectation.\nCentral government tax receipts were \u00a339.7 billion in October 2020 (on a national accounts basis), \u00a32.7 billion less than in October 2019, with notable falls in Value Added Tax (VAT), business rates and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) income tax.\nThis month, central government bodies spent \u00a371.3 billion on their day-to-day activities (referred to as current expenditure), \u00a36.4 billion more than in October 2019, including \u00a31.5 billion on its job furlough schemes.\nProvisional estimates indicate borrowing in the first seven months of the financial year-to-October 2020 has reached \u00a3214.9 billion, nearly four times the \u00a356.1 billion borrowed in the whole of 2019 to 2020.\nThe extra funding required to support government coronavirus (COVID-19) support schemes combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) have all helped push public sector net debt as a ratio of GDP to levels last seen in the early 1960s, with debt at the end of October 2020 at 100.8% of GDP.\nAs we have previously stated, both our borrowing and GDP estimates are subject to greater than usual uncertainty in part because of their partial reliance on forecast data.\nThis month, we have revised our previous published estimate of borrowing in the financial year-to-September 2020 down by \u00a315.9 billion, largely because of a \u00a35.7 billion increase in reported VAT receipts and a \u00a36.9 billion reduction in our recording of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) payments.\nAlso, we have increased our previous estimate of GDP in the third quarter of 2020 by \u00a343.2 billion to reflect the first published figure.\nAs a result, our estimate of debt as a ratio of GDP at the end of September 2020 has reduced by 2.3 percentage points, from the 103.5% published last month to 101.2%.\n", "id": 295}, {"document": "In October 2020, retail sales volumes increased by 1.2% when compared with September; the sixth consecutive month of growth in the industry.\nIn October, growth in the volume of sales for non-store retailing at 6.4%, household goods stores at 3.2% and department stores at 3.1% all contributed to the overall monthly increase in retail sales. \nIn October, the year-on-year growth rate in the volume of retail sales saw a strong increase of 5.8%, with feedback from a range of businesses suggesting that consumers had started Christmas shopping earlier this year, further helped by early discounting from a range of stores.\nLooking at October\u2019s total retail sales values (excluding fuel), which is a comparable measure to our online series, sales increased by 7.9% when compared with February; driven by a strong increase in sales online at 52.8% in comparison to reduced store sales at negative 3.3%.\nTable 1 provides a snapshot of what is happening in the retail sales industry in October 2020 with both value and volume growth rates.\nAll measures in the total retail sales industry saw an increase in October 2020. The monthly growth rate for value sales was 1.4% and for volume sales 1.2%. This was the sixth consecutive month of growth resulting in value and volume sales 5.2% and 6.7% higher respectively than in February 2020, before coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown restrictions were applied in the UK.\nIn the three months to October, value sales increased by 9.2% and volume sales by 8.9% when compared with the previous three months.\nIn October, retail sales volumes continued to increase for the sixth consecutive month, with a monthly growth rate of 1.2%. \nWe see sharp falls in sales at the start of the lockdown in March and April 2020, followed by strong growth to recovery in May and June 2020. A slower rate of growth is seen in the latest three months, with volume sales in October 2020 now 6.7% higher than February\u2019s pre-lockdown levels.\nFigure 2 shows the volume of sales for each retail sector from February 2020\u2019s pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown level. Non-store retailing has showed strength over the course of the pandemic and remained at high levels. In October 2020, volume sales within non-store retailing were 44.9% higher than February.\nMost sectors recovered to a higher level than February and feedback from various retailers informed us that consumers appeared to be shopping earlier for Christmas this year, which has helped boost sales.\nClothing stores and fuel were the only sectors still below their pre-lockdown sales. \nClothing stores were largely effected by the restrictions in place for non-essential stores during lockdown measures and was adversely effected as a result. Figure 9 in this latest indicators release also shows the impact of reduced footfall due to local lockdown restrictions in October. We talk more about footfall in section 4 of this release.\nFuel sales are yet to recover because of reduced car road traffic (Figure 3).\nFigure 3 shows the volume of fuel sales against car road traffic sales data used in the latest indicators for the UK release. Using the car road traffic in Figure 11 of this release, we created an average index for the same period as the retail sales questionnaire.\nWe can see that retail fuel sales are yet to make a full recovery from the falls experienced in March and April 2020 because of a reduction in car road traffic during the lockdown period and again in October 2020. As initial lockdown measures eased, fuel sales began to rise along with increased car traffic but as traffic levelled out and began to reduce in recent months, fuel sales failed to fully recover. In October, fuel sales still remained 8.8% below February\u2019s pre-lockdown level, while car road traffic reduced by an average 14.2%.\nLooking at the businesses common between the Retail Sales Inquiry and the Business Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Survey (BICS) during the two weeks from 5 October to 18 October 2020, Figure 4 shows that businesses within all retail sectors experienced some reduced footfall. We can see in Figure 5 that the strong growth in online sales is the driver for the overall growth in the retail industry.\nFigure 4 shows no increased footfall for fuel, clothing or department store businesses. Clothing stores and department store businesses reported the highest percentages of decreased footfall at 78.9% and 66.7% respectively. \nA reduction in footfall across stores may have resulted in a shift from store spending to shopping online (Figure 5).\nIn Figure 5 we look at value store sales alongside online value sales. We have excluded fuel and non-store retailing since retail fuel sales are not included online and non-store retailing will not include store sales.\nIn October 2020, total retail sales values (excluding fuel) increased by 7.9% when compared with February 2020, driven by a strong increase for sales online at 52.8% in comparison with a decline in store sales at negative 3.3%.\nIn October, we can see that online sales for all sectors increased when compared with February. Online food sales nearly doubled, with an increase of 99.2% in comparison with food store sales, which saw a fall of 2.1%. Overall, total food sales increased by 3.4% when compared with February.\nClothing stores, with an overall decline of 14.0% in value sales, increased their online sales by 17.1% but saw the biggest fall in store sales at negative 22.1%.\nTable 2 shows the month-on-month and year-on-year growth rates for the amount spent online, in addition to the proportion of online sales. The percentage weights indicate where money is spent online.\nIn October 2020, we saw strong growth in value sales across all sectors when compared with the same month a year earlier. Online food sales increased by 99.2%, department stores by 87.2% and other non-food stores by 89.7% when compared with the previous year. This is because of online sales reaching higher than usual levels over the course of the pandemic. All sectors saw an increase in online sales on the month with some retailers taking advantage of promotional activity to encourage more spending.\nThe proportion of online sales increased to 28.5% compared with the 27.6% reported in September. \n\nRetail Sales Index  Dataset | Released 20 November 2020  A series of retail sales data for Great Britain in value and volume terms, seasonally and non-seasonally adjusted.Retail Sales pounds data  Dataset | Released 20 November 2020  Total sales and average weekly spending estimates for each retail sector in Great Britain in \u00a3 thousands.Retail Sales Index internet sales  Dataset | Released 20 November 2020  Internet sales in Great Britain by store type, month and year.Retail Sales Index categories and their percentage weights  Dataset | Released 20 November 2020  Retail sales categories and descriptions and their percentage of all retailing in Great Britain. \n\n\n", "summary": "Retail sales see sixth consecutive month of growth\nRetail sales volumes increased by 1.2% in October 2020 compared with September 2020; this is the sixth consecutive month of growth, resulting in an increase of 6.7% when compared with February 2020, before coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown restrictions were applied in the UK.\nIn October, growth in the volume of sales for non-store retailing (6.4%), household goods stores (3.2%) and department stores (3.1%) all contributed to the overall monthly increase in retail sales.\nThe year-on-year growth rate in the volume of retail sales saw a strong increase of 5.8% in October 2020.

Details of the methodology used for these indicators can be found in Online price changes methodology. This analysis is experimental and should not be compared with our regular consumer price statistics.\nThe data time series, weekly growth rates, and contributions to the weekly change for all individual food and drink items, along with sample sizes, are published in a dataset alongside this release.\nThe addition of data, originally missing from the collection in the week ending 15 November 2020, has resulted in minor revisions to that week\u2019s figures.\nOnline prices of items in the food and drink basket decreased overall by 0.1% between the week ending 15 November 2020 and the week ending 22 November 2020. This is the sixth consecutive week of price decreases across all food and drink items. Figure 4 presents the contributions to the latest weekly change from each of the main categories of items.\nThere were two main contributors to the overall price fall in the latest week. Firstly, the category of mineral waters, soft drinks and juices contributed negative 0.04 percentage points to the overall fall in the food and drink basket in the latest week, over half of which came from price decreases for fizzy drinks. Fruit prices also contributed negative 0.04 percentage points, half of which came from price decreases for peanuts, although 11 of the 18 \u201cfruit\u201d items showed price decreases.\nSpirits was also a large contributor to the overall price fall in the latest week. This category contributed negative 0.03 percentage points to the overall fall, driven by price falls for all spirit items except alcopops. \nSeveral categories experienced price rises, partially offsetting these falls in the latest week. This includes bread and cereals, which was the main contributor to last week\u2019s overall price fall. \nFigure 5 with the data time series for the all-item index and some of the leading categories of the weekly change, shows that the all-item index has been on a broadly downward trend since the beginning of June 2020. It has now fallen for the sixth consecutive week.\nMineral waters, soft drinks and juices, and spirits have shown broadly similar trends over the last few months, with prices peaking in early October 2020 before steadily falling in recent weeks. Fruit prices peaked at the end of October 2020, but prices have also started to drop. All three categories are now slightly below their starting point in June 2020.\nThe oils and fats category, while having a minor contribution to the week-on-week changes, has shown a continuous decline since June 2020 and is now 6.3% lower than its starting point.\nWithin the oils and fats category, margarine and olive oil have been the biggest drivers behind the downward trend. \nThese figures use job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, and include experimental estimates of online job adverts by Adzuna category and by UK country and NUTS1 region. The number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour. The Adzuna categories used do not correspond to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Vacancy Survey.\nUsers should be aware that we have changed the presentation of our online job advert data to show the percentage change from the same week in the previous year of each category. This replaces our previous analyses, which compared the current period with a whole of 2019 average, and removes some of the seasonality that previous comparisons may have contained. \nUsers should also be aware that the 2019 average data will still be published alongside the percentage change from the same week in the previous year.\nTotal weekly job adverts on Adzuna, UK, 4 January 2019 to 20 November 2020, percentage change from the same week in the previous year\nData download \nIn the latest week, total online job adverts saw a slight increase of two percentage points but are still only 71% of the level seen in the same week last year, compared with 69% in the previous week. \nCatering and hospitality saw the largest annual decrease to just 25% of the level of online job adverts seen in the same period last year. Healthcare and education remain the categories with the highest volume of online job adverts in comparison with a year ago. Both are around 80% of the level seen in the same period last year.\nExcluding the \u201cunknown\u201d category, in comparison with the previous week, the number of online job adverts increased in 21 of the Adzuna categories, decreased in five categories, and stayed the same in the remaining two. The largest weekly increase came from \u201ccharity/volunteering\u201d, which increased by 10 percentage points, followed by \u201cother/general\u201d, which increased by nine percentage points on the week. \nThe largest weekly decrease of five percentage points came from \u201cenergy/oil and gas\u201d.

In the latest week, (week ending 22 November 2020) footfall increased substantially in Northern Ireland to 73% of levels seen last year, a 12 percentage point increase on the previous week. This can be explained by the temporary removal of some restrictions under Northern Ireland\u2019s circuit breaker and a surge in retail activity ahead of new restrictions coming into force from 27 November 2020. Footfall increased slightly in Scotland and across all English regions except the East Midlands.\nWales experienced a decline of two percentage points on the previous week. Despite this, Wales continues to see volumes of weekly footfall similar to those seen before the national firebreak, which ended on 9 November 2020.

This is in line with expectation, given coroner involvement with the investigation of these deaths and the amount of time it takes to hold an inquest. \n\n!\n\nAll deaths caused by suicide in England are investigated by coroners. Given the length of time it takes to hold an inquest, most deaths are registered around five to six months after they occurred. \n\n\n\nLooking at Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) of 2020 specifically, 3.6% of the 1,262 suicides registered in this period had a date of death in the same period (45 deaths), with the remaining deaths (96.4% or 1,217 deaths) occurring before 2020. \nFor Quarter 2 (Apr to June) of 2020, 5.3% of the 845 suicides registered in the period occurred in the same period (45 deaths), with the remaining deaths occurring in the first quarter of 2020 (43.7% or 369 deaths) or prior to 2020 (51.0% or 431 deaths). \nFor Quarter 3 (July to Sept) of 2020, 5.3% of the 1,334 suicides registered in the period occurred in the same period (71 deaths), with the remaining deaths occurring in the first quarter of 2020 (34.9% or 466 deaths), the second quarter of 2020 (28.3% or 378 deaths) or prior to 2020 (31.4% or 419 deaths).\nThe number and rate of registered deaths from suicide increased in the third quarter of 2020 when compared with the second quarter of 2020. However, this increase likely reflects the resuming of coroner\u2019s inquests as opposed to a genuine increase in suicide. The suicide rate in the third quarter of 2020 is similar to those observed in the same quarter in previous years. We will continue to monitor and update the statistics on a quarterly basis. \nThe 845 suicides registered in the second quarter of 2020 is the lowest number of any quarter since 2001, when the data time series reported for this statistical release begins. \nThese numbers should be interpreted with caution. It is likely that the lower number of suicides registered in this period reflects the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the coroner\u2019s service in England and Wales, for example, delays to inquests caused by the service adapting to social distancing measures. It is unlikely that the reduction in registered deaths reflects a genuine reduction in the number of suicides. Further information on the reduction in the second quarter of 2020 can be found in our previous release. \nIn England and Wales, when someone dies unexpectedly, a coroner investigates the circumstances to establish the cause of death. In July 2018, the standard of proof used by coroners to determine whether a death was caused by suicide was lowered to the \u201ccivil standard\u201d \u2013 balance of probabilities \u2013 where previously a \u201ccriminal standard\u201d was applied \u2013 beyond all reasonable doubt. \nSince the change in the standard of proof, suicide rates have not seen unprecedented increases. Recent increases have been seen among English males and females, but these increases started before the change in the standard of proof. \nWhenever a change in suicide rates occurs, the reasons are complex and will rarely be because of one factor alone.

The beginning of 2020 saw a pick-up in annual growth in the housing market before the coronavirus restrictions were put in place at the end of March 2020.\nPrice variations at the beginning of 2020 may reflect the unusual conditions in the housing market at the time. People were advised not to move house during the tightest restrictions in April and May. As such, property transactions completed during that time may have been more concentrated than usual among those without complicating factors, such as a chain. For example, first-time buyers \u2013 typically at the lower end of the price scale \u2013 may have been freer to complete transactions than former owner-occupiers, who may have had to co-ordinate multiple sales during lockdown.\nRecent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations.\nPent-up demand may have contributed towards an increase in house prices.

Results from this week are based on 4,151 responding adults (69% response rate).\nFor the latest weekly update presented in Section 3: Main indicators in Great Britain, \"this week\" refers to responses collected during the period 2 to 6 December 2020 and \"last week\" refers to responses collected during the period 25 to 29 November 2020.\nAdditional data on the social impacts with breakdowns by age, sex, underlying health condition, English regions and country, including\u00a0confidence intervals\u00a0for the estimates, are contained in the\u00a0accompanying datasets.\nIf you are affected by the topics covered in this article, the NHS provides useful information on the symptoms of depression and anxiety, and the support available. Every Mind Matters also provides helpful advice on looking after your mental health during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Explore the latest coronavirus data from the ONS and other sources.

Responses for the period (2 to 6 December) were collected over a period during which this new tier-based system applied. During these periods, Scotland was subject to five-tiered local protection levels and national guidance was in place across Wales. For some questions, respondents were asked to consider the past seven days; therefore, some responses may relate to before the period started. \n\n\n\nThere are several measures in place to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), such as handwashing, use of face coverings, avoiding physical contact and self-isolating. These indicators are presented at a Great Britain level in Table 1.\nCompliance with most measures remained high this week, with 89% (89% last week) reporting always or often handwashing after returning home, 97% (97% last week) using a face covering, and 89% (90% last week) avoiding physical contact when outside their home; 85% (88% last week) of adults reported always or often maintaining social distance when outside their support bubble this week.\nDownload the data\nThis week in Great Britain, average personal well-being scores for life satisfaction (6.8), feeling that things done in life are worthwhile (7.3), and happiness (6.8) remained the same as last week, while there was a slight decrease in the anxiety score (4.1).\nGreat Britain, March to December 2020\nDownload the data\nHalf (50%) of adults reported that their well-being was being affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic this week. Among those who said the coronavirus was affecting their well-being, the most common effects reported were feeling stressed or anxious (62%), feeling bored (51%) and feeling worried about the future (49%).\nThis week, around 3 in 10 (28%) adults felt that life will return to normal in six months or less, an increase from around 1 in 10 (9%) on 21 to 25 October 2020.\nSince the summer (over the period 15 to 19 July), a higher proportion of adults reported that they think it will be more than a year before life returns to normal, compared with those who report that it will be six months or less.\nIn the last couple of weeks, from 25 to 29 November, a higher proportion of adults reported that they think life will return to normal in less than six months, compared with those who report that it will be more than a year.\nGreat Britain, March to December 2020\nDownload the data\nNearly 1 in 3 (31%) of adults aged 70 years and over think their life would return to normal in six months or less, compared with 26% of adults aged 30 to 49.\nMen and women's perception of the future was similar - 32% of men thought life would return to normal in seven months to a year, compared with 34% of women.\nAround 1 in 4 (25%) adults in the East of England and the Yorkshire and Humberside regions reported that they thought their life would return to normal in six months or less. In comparison, 33% of adults in London felt their life would return to normal within six months. However, it is important to note differences between the countries and regions of Great Britain were not statistically significant.\nNearly 4 in 10 (37%) adults who felt either comfortable or very comfortable leaving their homes reported that they expect life to return to normal in six months or less, a higher percentage than adults who felt uncomfortable or very uncomfortable (20%).\n\n!\n\nResponses for the latest period were collected between 11 and 29 November 2020. Over this period there was a second national lockdown in England, Scotland was subject to five-tiered local protection levels and national guidance was in place across Wales. \n\n\n\nDepression and anxiety are among the most common types of mental disorders experienced by adults in Great Britain. They can affect people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. Depressive symptoms range from lasting feelings of hopelessness, to losing interest in things one used to enjoy. Symptoms of anxiety include feelings of nervousness or being on edge, and how bothered one is about not being able to stop or control worrying.\nIn this bulletin, we have looked at depression and anxiety separately, using a robust set of measures looking at symptoms of depression and anxiety over the previous two weeks. It is important to note that some adults may have been experiencing both depression and anxiety at the same time, which is not covered in this release.\nIn November 2020, 19% of adults experienced some form of depression, indicated by moderate to severe depressive symptoms, while 17% experienced some form of anxiety.\nThe rate of adults experiencing some form of depression in November 2020 were similar to earlier in the pandemic (19% in June 2020). However, these rates have almost doubled from around 1 in 10 (10%) before the pandemic (July 2019 to March 2020).\nAnalysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) earlier this year indicated that there were four characteristics associated with moderate to severe depressive symptoms during the pandemic: age, sex, disability and the inability to afford an unexpected expense. This section provides a summary of these characteristics again, to see if there has been any change in the depressive symptoms of adults in November 2020, when England was in a second national lockdown and additional restrictions were in place in Wales and Scotland.\nWe also explore anxiety by these four characteristics to provide an insight into the experiences of adults with some form of anxiety. This builds upon analysis by the ONS earlier this year looking at coronavirus and anxiety in adults, using the ONS personal well-being measures.\nIt should be noted that while mental health may be influenced by these characteristics, causation cannot be inferred. Information on interpreting findings in this report is included in Section 11: Measuring the data.\nYounger adults were more likely to experience some form of depression and some form of anxiety than older adults. Around 3 in 10 adults aged 16 to 29 years experienced some form of depression (31%), with 29% experiencing some form of anxiety in November 2020, compared with 8% and 6% respectively of adults aged 70 years and over (Figure 3).\nIn June 2020, a similar pattern was observed, with younger adults (aged 16 to 39 years) more likely to experience some form of depression than other adults. Rates of depression in November 2020 were higher in all age groups when compared with before the pandemic (July 2019 to March 2020).\nWomen were more likely to experience some form of depression and some form of anxiety than men. In November 2020, around 2 in 10 women experienced some form of depression (22%) and anxiety (21%), compared with 15% and 13% of men respectively (Figure 4).\nIn June 2020, a similar proportion of adults experienced some form of depression (23% of women and 15% of men), however rates during both periods in the pandemic were around two times greater than those observed before the pandemic (July 2019 to March 2020) for women (12%) and men (7%).\nDisabled adults were more likely than non-disabled adults to experience some form of depression and some form of anxiety. In November 2020, around 4 in 10 (39%) disabled adults experienced some form of depression, while a third (34%) experienced some form of anxiety. This compares with just over 1 in 10 (11%) non-disabled adults (Figure 5).\nIn June 2020, a similar proportion of disabled adults (35%) and non-disabled adults (12%) experienced some form of depression when compared with November 2020. Rates in November were higher when compared with before the pandemic (July 2019 to March 2020), where 27% of disabled adults and 4% of non-disabled adults experienced some form of depression.\nAdults were asked if their household could afford an unexpected but necessary expense of \u00a3850. This gives us an indication of adults who may be struggling financially. Figure 6 shows that adults who said their household was unable to afford this expense were more likely to be experiencing some form of depression and some form of anxiety, compared with other adults.\nAround 3 in 10 (31%) adults who said their household was unable to afford an unexpected but necessary expense of \u00a3850 experienced some form of depression in November 2020, while just over a quarter (27%) of adults in this group experienced some form of anxiety. This compares with 11% and 12% respectively of adults whose households were able to afford such an expense.\nIn June 2020, a similar proportion of adults who said their household was unable to afford an unexpected but necessary expense of \u00a3850 experienced some form of depression (35%), increasing from 21% since before the pandemic (July 2019 to March 2020).\nIn November 2020, rates of some form of depression in adults ranged from 17% in the South East, London and the East of England to 22% in the North East. Similar proportions were observed in Wales (21%) and Scotland (20%). No significant differences were found between the countries and regions of Great Britain.\nRates of adults experiencing some form of anxiety ranged from 16% in the South and East of England to 20% in London. Similar proportions were observed in Wales (20%) and Scotland (16%). No significant differences were found between the countries and regions of Great Britain.\nWe have also included analysis to understand how the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the life and well-being of adults experiencing some form of depression and anxiety.\nIn November 2020, the most common concern of how the coronavirus pandemic was affecting lives was the lack of freedom and independence, with around 6 in 10 (61%) adults reporting this. A similar proportion was observed regardless of whether someone had experienced some form of depression or some form of anxiety (60%), making it the second most common concern for those experiencing anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nAlmost half of adults (48%) reported that their well-being was being affected, however this increased to 81% for those who had experienced some form of depression and some form of anxiety, which was the most common concern for these adults.\nSimilar trends were found earlier in the pandemic, where well-being was reported as one of the most common concerns by adults experiencing some form of depression (80%). More information can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nAmong those that said their well-being was being affected by the coronavirus pandemic, 6 in 10 (60%) said they were feeling stressed or anxious, the most common reported feeling. This proportion increased to around 8 in 10 (82%) for those experiencing some form of depression, and nearly 9 in 10 (89%) for those experiencing some form of anxiety. \nSimilar trends were found earlier in the pandemic, where feeling stressed or anxious was reported as one of the most common concerns by adults who had reported their well-being was being affected and had experienced some form of depression (85%). More information can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nIn November 2020, 7% of adults reported feeling lonely often or always. A higher proportion of adults who had experienced some form of depression reported feeling lonely often or always (26%) compared with adults experiencing no or mild depressive symptoms (3%).\nThis was similar for those who had experienced some form of anxiety, with 24% reporting feeling lonely often or always, compared with 3% of those who were unlikely to have experienced some form of anxiety. \nUsing data collected between 11 and 29 November, we have explored how these feelings about the future compare based on reported depressive symptoms and anxiety in adults.\nIn November 2020, 15% of adults experiencing moderate to severe depressive symptoms felt it would be six months or less before their life returned to normal. This was the case for a higher percentage (25%) of adults with no or mild depressive symptoms. \nA similar trend was observed for those experiencing some form of anxiety, with 16% of those who had experienced some form of anxiety feeling it will take six months or less for their life to return to normal, compared with 24% of adults unlikely to have experienced some form of anxiety.\n", "summary": "Return to normal optimism but mental health not improving\nPeople are generally becoming more optimistic about life returning to normal, with around 3 in 10 adults feeling that life will be normal in six months or less.\nIn November 2020, adults experiencing some form of depression or anxiety were less likely to feel there would be a return to normal sooner.\nAround one in five adults in the Opinion and Lifestyle Survey were experiencing moderate or severe depressive symptoms.\nThis is the same rate of depression as in June 2020 and significantly higher than before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nNew questions in November showed 17% of adults were experiencing some form of anxiety.\nAdults experiencing depression were eight times more likely to also report feeling lonely often or always, with a similar pattern for anxiety.\nOverall, around half of adults said their well-being had been affected by the pandemic.\nGroups that were more likely to report feelings of depression and anxiety were those aged 16 to 29 years, women, people with disabilities, and those who were less able to cover an unexpected expense.\nCompliance with most measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus remained high in the week from 2 to 6 December 2020.\nOf those surveyed, 89% said they always or often washed their hands on returning home, 97% used a face covering, and 89% avoided physical contact when outside their home.\n", "id": 313}, {"document": "Other commentary from the latest public sector finances data can be found on the following pages:\nRecent and upcoming changes to public sector finance statistics: November 2020\nPublic sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks, PSNB ex) is estimated to have been \u00a331.6 billion in November 2020, \u00a326.0 billion more than in November 2019, which is both the highest November borrowing and the third-highest borrowing in any month since monthly records began in 1993.\nCentral government tax receipts are estimated to have been \u00a338.9 billion in November 2020 (on a national accounts basis), \u00a33.2 billion less than in November 2019, with notable falls in Value Added Tax (VAT) and Business Rates.\nCentral government bodies are estimated to have spent \u00a380.6 billion on day-to-day activities (current expenditure) in November 2020, \u00a323.5 billion more than in November 2019; this growth includes \u00a35.9 billion additional expenditure on coronavirus job support schemes.\nPublic sector net borrowing (PSNB ex) in the first eight months of this financial year (April to November 2020) is estimated to have been \u00a3240.9 billion, \u00a3188.6 billion more than in the same period last year and the highest public sector borrowing in any April to November period since records began in 1993.\nPublic sector net debt excluding public sector banks (PSND ex) rose by \u00a3301.6 billion in the first eight months of the financial year to reach \u00a32,099.8 billion at the end of November 2020, or around 99.5% of GDP; this was the highest debt to GDP ratio since the financial year ending 1962.\nThis month we have updated our estimates to incorporate the latest official Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) GDP forecasts (published on 25 November 2020) and as a result we have revised down our previous estimates of public sector net debt as a percentage of GDP for recent months to below 100% (see section 7).\nCentral government net cash requirement (excluding UK Asset Resolution Ltd and Network Rail) was \u00a323.9 billion in November 2020, bringing the current financial year-to-November total to \u00a3284.7 billion, around three times the highest cash requirement in any other April to November period since records began in 1984.\nGeneral government net borrowing in the first eight months of this financial year (April to November 2020) is estimated to have been around 11.2% of GDP, while general government gross debt stood at around 102.8% of GDP at the end of November 2020; statistics for the general government sector are used for international comparisons and include central and local government only. \u2003 \n!\n\nOur estimates expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) are partially based on official projections, which means figures for recent periods are subject to revision, particularly considering the uncertain impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy. \n\n\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a substantial impact on the economy and subsequently on public sector borrowing and debt. \nCentral government tax and national insurance receipts (combined) in the eight months-to-November 2020 fell by \u00a338.3 billion (or 8.6%) compared with the same period in 2019, while government support for individuals and businesses during the pandemic contributed to an increase of \u00a3147.3 billion (or 30.0%) in central government day-to-day (or current) spending.\nThe latest official forecasts, published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) on 25 November 2020, indicate that the \u00a3240.9 billion borrowed by the public sector in the financial year-to-November 2020 could reach \u00a3393.5 billion by the end of March 2021. \n\n!\n\nAlthough the impact of the pandemic on the public finances is becoming clearer, its effects are not fully captured in this release, meaning that estimates of accrued tax receipts and borrowing are subject to greater than usual uncertainty. \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figures published by the Office for Budget Responsibility\u00b9 suggest borrowing could increase to \u00a3393.5 billion for the financial year ending March 2021\nPublic sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks, UK, cumulative financial year-to- November 2020 compared with official estimates \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Office for Budget Responsibility and Office for National Statistics \u2013 Public sector finances\n\nNotes:\n\nThis chart uses the OBR Economic and fiscal outlook \u2013 November 2020.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 1: Figures published by the Office for Budget Responsibility\u00b9 suggest borrowing could increase to \u00a3393.5 billion for the financial year ending March 2021\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThe extra funding required to support government coronavirus support schemes combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) have all helped push public sector net debt as a ratio of GDP to levels last seen in the early 1960s. Public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) at the end of November 2020 was equivalent to 99.5% of GDP. \nEstimates of GDP and tax receipts presented in this bulletin are partially based on official projections published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\nOn the 25 November 2020 the OBR published their Economic and fiscal outlook \u2013 November 2020, the first official forecast to consider the impact of COVID-19 on the public sector finances. \nWhile we have been able to incorporate the latest GDP forecasts from this publication into the data underlying this bulletin, estimates of monthly tax receipts remain partially based on OBR\u2019s Fiscal Sustainability Report and summer economic update monthly profiles \u2013 21 August 2020 (XLS, 201KB). \nWe continue to work with OBR and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) with the intention of fully incorporating the latest forecasts in the December 2020 Public sector finances release (published on 22 January 2021).\nIn total, over 40 schemes have been announced by the UK government and the devolved administrations to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic. In this section we list the largest of the active schemes by implementation status within the public sector finances. More details on the impact of the pandemic on the public sector finances are provided in section 12 of this release and the accompanying Recent and upcoming changes to public sector finances, November 2020 article. \nSchemes fully recorded in compliance with existing international statistical guidance are:\nCOVID-19 Corporate Financing Facility\nCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)\nSelf-employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS)\nEat Out to Help Out\nsupport package for air navigation service providers\nsome of the subsidies paid out to businesses\nThe following schemes are partially or not yet implemented in the public sector finance statistics:\nCoronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme\nCoronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme\nBounce Back Loan Scheme\nFuture Fund\nEmergency Measures Agreements for train operating companies\nTrade Credit Reinsurance Scheme\nFinally, some schemes have been announced but relate to future periods. This category includes cases where the scheme may be open for applications, but no payments have yet been made. This group includes the following schemes:\nJob Support Scheme (JSS)\nLocal Restrictions Support Grant\nIn November 2020, the public sector spent more money than it received in taxes and other income, requiring it to borrow \u00a331.6 billion, \u00a326.0 billion more than it borrowed in November 2019.\nTable 1 summarises the components of public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks) in November 2020 and compares them with the equivalent measures in the same month a year earlier. Additionally, the table presents estimates of the borrowing of public sector banks and the full public sector net borrowing measure.\n\n!\n\nBorrowing estimates in the current financial year (April to November 2020) are subject to more uncertainty than usual as a result of the challenges we face in collecting data during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \n\n\n\nCentral government is the largest sub-sector of the public sector. Of the \u00a331.6 billion borrowed by the public sector in November 2020, \u00a332.3 billion was borrowed by central government, with a surplus in Bank of England\u2019s contribution to borrowing. \nIn November 2020, central government receipts were estimated to have fallen by \u00a33.5 billion compared with November 2019 to \u00a353.9 billion, including \u00a338.9 billion in tax receipts.\nIn the most recent months, tax receipts recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis are always subject to some uncertainty, as many taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT), Corporation Tax and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Income Tax contain some forecast cash receipts data and are liable to revision when actual cash receipts data are received. \nTable 2 summarises the components of central government receipts in November 2020 and compares them with the equivalent measures in the same month a year earlier.\nCentral government bodies spent \u00a383.6 billion in November 2020, \u00a324.6 billion more than in November 2019. Of this, \u00a380.6 billion was spent on day-to-day activities (often referred to as current expenditure), such as:\nproviding services and grants (for example, related to education, defence, and health and social care) \u2013 including the current job furlough schemes\npayment of social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, Child Benefit and Statutory Maternity Pay)\npayment of the interest on the government\u2019s outstanding debt \nThe remaining \u00a33.0 billion was spent on capital investment such as infrastructure.\nTable 3 summarises the components of central government expenditure in November 2020 and compares them with the equivalent measures in the same month a year earlier.\nInterest payments on the government\u2019s outstanding debt were \u00a34.2 billion in November 2020, \u00a32.1 billion more than in November 2019. Changes in debt interest are largely a result of movements in the Retail Prices Index to which index-linked bonds are pegged. \nCentral government departments spent \u00a37.5 billion more on goods and services in November 2020 than in November 2019, including \u00a37.1 billion more on procurement and \u00a30.8 billion more on pay. These increases partially reflect the expenditure by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), devolved administrations and other departments in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn November 2020, central government paid \u00a37.2 billion more in subsidies to businesses and households than in November 2019. These additional payments included \u00a35.9 billion as a part of the\u00a0Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)\u00a0and the\u00a0Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). \nBoth local government and public corporations\u2019 data for November 2020 are initial estimates, largely based on the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR\u2019s) Economic and fiscal outlook (November 2020), which will be revised when further information is available.\nSubsidies paid out to businesses as part of the Coronavirus Small Business Grant Fund, the Coronavirus Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund, the Coronavirus Local Authority Discretionary Grants, and similar schemes in devolved administrations, are included based on administrative data published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) and by the Scottish and Welsh Governments. \nCurrent and capital transfers between these sub-sectors and central government are based on administrative data supplied by HM Treasury and have no impact at the public sector level.\nIn the current financial year to November 2020, the public sector borrowed \u00a3240.9 billion, \u00a3188.6 billion more than in the same period last year. \nThis substantial increase largely reflects the impact of the pandemic on the public finances, with the furlough schemes alone adding \u00a360.4 billion to borrowing in the financial year-to-November 2020.\nTable 4 summarises the components of public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks) in the financial year-to-November 2020 and compares them with the equivalent measures in the same period a year earlier. Additionally, the table presents estimates of the borrowing of public sector banks and the full public sector net borrowing measure.\nBorrowing had generally been falling since its peak in financial year ending (FYE) 2010. However, the \u00a357.4 billion borrowed in the latest full financial year (April 2019 to March 2020) was \u00a318.4 billion more than in the previous financial year, largely because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic being evident from March 2020. \nThe borrowing estimates presented in this bulletin are not adjusted for inflation. We recommend that users consider borrowing as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) when analysing its movements over a long period. \nTable 5 summarises the components of central government receipts in the financial year-to-November 2020 and compares them with the equivalent measures in the same period a year earlier.\nOn 20 March 2020, the government introduced a Value Added Tax (VAT) payment deferral policy to support UK business during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by enabling them to pay Value Added Tax (VAT) due between 20 March and 30 June 2020 at a later date (though before 31 March 2022). \nVAT receipts recorded in the financial year-to-November 2020 are provisional because the impact of this deferrals scheme has been estimated. \nSee section 12 for more information on the challenges of measuring the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on VAT and other tax receipts.\nTable 6 summarises the components of central government expenditure in the financial year-to-November 2020 and compares them with the equivalent measures in the same period a year earlier.\nCentral government bodies are estimated to have spent \u00a3637.8 billion on day-to-day activities (current expenditure) in the financial year-to-November 2020, \u00a3147.3 billion more than in the same period in 2019. Of this additional expenditure, \u00a360.4 billion was paid as a part of the job furlough schemes, with \u00a346.9 billion on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and \u00a313.5 billion on the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS).\nCJRS payments on an accrued (or national accounts) basis for the period March to October 2020 are based on HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) estimates, while November reflects the latest OBR official forecast. SEISS payments are currently recorded on a cash basis, reflecting HMRC coronavirus statistics. \nIn the financial year-to-November 2020, local government borrowing is in surplus although the pattern of local government expenditure in recent months is subject to greater than usual uncertainty. Some COVID-related current grants that have been paid by central to local government have not been spent yet by local government, with the possibility of any unspent grants being returned to central government. \nThe central government net cash requirement (CGNCR), excluding UK Asset Resolution Ltd and Network Rail, is the amount of cash needed immediately for the UK government to meet its obligations. To obtain cash, the UK government sells financial instruments, gilts or Treasury Bills. \nThe amount of cash required will be affected by changes in the timing of tax payments by individuals and businesses but does not depend on forecast tax receipts in the same way as our accrued (or national accounts) based measures.\nThe CGNCR consequently contains the most timely information and is less susceptible to revision. However, as for any cash measure, the CGNCR does not reflect the overall amount for which the government is liable or the point at which any liability is incurred \u2013 it only reflects when cash is received and spent. \nOn 20 March 2020, the government introduced a Value Added Tax (VAT) payment deferral policy to support UK businesses during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by enabling them to pay Value Added Tax (VAT) due between 20 March and 30 June 2020 at a later date (though before 31 March 2022). This policy has substantially lowered VAT cash receipts over this four-month period.\nTables 7 and 8 demonstrate how CGNCR is calculated from cash receipts and cash outlays. This presentation focuses on the central government\u2019s own account and excludes cash payments to both local government and public non-financial corporations. \nOn the same day that we release the public sector finances, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) publishes a Summary of HMRC tax receipts, National Insurance contributions (NICs), tax credit expenditure and Child Benefit for the UK containing a detailed list of cash receipts.\nPublic sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) rose by \u00a3301.6 billion in the first eight months of the financial year to reach \u00a32,099.8 billion at the end of November 2020, \u00a3303.0 billion more than in November 2019.\nThe extra funding required to support government coronavirus support schemes combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) have all helped push public sector net debt as a ratio of GDP to levels last seen in the early 1960s. Public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) at the end of November 2020 was equivalent to 99.5% of GDP. \n\n!\n\nOur estimates expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) are partially based on official projections, which means figures for recent periods are subject to revision particularly considering the uncertain impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy. \n\n\n\nDebt represents the amount of money owed by the public sector to the private sector and is largely made up of gilts (or bonds) issued to investors by central government. \nAt the end of November 2020, there was \u00a31,805.2 billion of central government gilts in circulation (including those held by the Bank of England (BoE) Asset Purchase Facility Fund). These gilts are auctioned by the Debt Management Office (DMO), on behalf of central government in accordance with its financing remit.\nThere has been a substantial month-on-month increase in gilts issuance at face (or redemption) value in the current financial year, partially reflecting the need for extra funding to support government coronavirus (COVID-19) support schemes and to compensate for the fall in tax revenue.\nThe Bank of England\u2019s (BoE\u2019s) contribution to debt is largely a result of its quantitative easing activities via the BoE Asset Purchase Facility Fund (APF) and Term Funding Schemes (TFS). \nIf we were to remove the temporary debt impact of these schemes along with the other transactions relating to the normal operations of the BoE, public sector net debt excluding public sector banks (PSND ex) at the end of November 2020 would reduce by \u00a3233.9 billion (or 11.1 percentage points of GDP) to \u00a31,865.9 billion (or 88.4% of GDP).\nGilts are the primary financial instrument purchased under the APF. At the end of November 2020, the gilt holdings of the APF were \u00a3602.1 billion at face (or redemption) value, an increase of \u00a317.3 billion compared with a month earlier. Following a government announcement on 5 November 2020, the gilt holdings of the APF are currently capped at \u00a3875 billion.\nThe estimated impact of the APF\u2019s gilt holdings on debt currently stands at \u00a3109.6 billion, representing the difference between the value of the reserves created to purchase gilts (or market value of the gilts) and the face (or redemption) value of the gilts purchased. \nIn this case, it is not the gilt holdings themselves that contribute to debt but the difference in the valuations for these assets. The final debt impact of the APF depends on the disposal of these financial instruments at the end of the scheme (more specifically, the price received at their re-sale compared with their purchase price).\nCorporate bond purchases under the APF umbrella have been on a smaller scale than gilt purchases. The total corporate bond holdings at the end of November 2020 stood at \u00a320.1 billion, adding an equivalent amount to the level of debt. \nThe Term Funding Schemes aim to reinforce the transmission of Bank Rate cuts to those interest rates faced by households and businesses.\nThe public sector balance sheet contains a liability as a result of the creation of the central bank reserves and an asset as a result of the loans to TFS (and TFSME) participants.\nAt the end of November 2020, TFS loan liability stood at \u00a367.3 billion and TFSME loan liability stood at \u00a350.8 billion, making a combined liability of \u00a3118.1 billion, adding an equivalent amount to the level of debt. \nAssets purchased under the TFS and TFSME fall outside the boundary of PSNDex: users who are interested in wider measures of the public sector balance sheet may find estimates of Public Sector Net Financial Liabilities (PSNFL) of interest. \nThe data for the latest months of every release contain a degree of forecasts; subsequently, these are replaced by improved forecasts as further data are made available and finally by outturn data. \nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a substantial impact on both tax receipts and expenditure. These impacts are likely to be revised further as the full effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the public finances continue to become clearer.\nThe revisions presented in this section are largely the result of new tax and expenditure data received from our data suppliers. \nThis month we have reduced our previous estimate of borrowing in the financial year-to-October 2020 by \u00a35.6 billion, with the revisions being spread across sub-sectors and components.\nTable 9 summarises the revisions to the components of public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks) by comparing them with the equivalent measures published in the previous bulletin (published on 20 November 2020).\nTable 10 summarises the revisions to central government receipts by comparing them with the equivalent measures published in the previous bulletin (published on 20 November 2020).\nVAT receipts for any month are recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis by time-adjusting the average cash receipts expected in the following three months. This means that VAT receipts on an accrued basis in November depend on forecast cash receipts for December, January and February. These are updated as actual receipts become known. \nSection 12 explains the challenges of measuring the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on tax receipts and discusses the recording of tax receipts in some detail.\nTable 11 summarises the revisions to central government expenditure by comparing them with the equivalent measures published in the previous bulletin (published on 20 November 2020).\nThis month we have amended budget forecast estimates for the financial year to date (April to November 2020) based on updated forecast data from the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s Economic and Fiscal Outlook November 2020.\nThis month we have received new data for aspects of the public corporations sub-sector that have replaced previous estimates. These include updated forecast estimates for Transport Trading Limited companies for the year-to-date.\nTable 12 shows the revisions to net borrowing in the most recent full financial years presented in this bulletin compared with those presented in the previous bulletin (published on 20 November 2020). \nIn September 2019, we changed the way in which we record student loans in the public sector finance statistics. Data underlying this recording are generally available annually, as new outturn and forecasts become available. Having updated our previous estimates in September 2020, we noted that further updates outside of the annual cycle may occur. This month we have updated our estimates again to reflect the latest available source data for the financial years ending March 2019 and March 2020. Our next planned update of student loans data is in September 2021. \nAs a result of this update, we have reduced central government debt write-offs for student loans by \u00a30.4 billion in the financial year ending March 2019 and \u00a30.2 billion in the financial year ending March 2020. These write-offs are recorded as capital expenditure and so reduced central government net borrowing by corresponding amounts.\nThis month we have updated our previous estimates of current grants paid by central government to the private sector, by \u00a30.7 billion in the financial year ending March 2020, increasing central government net borrowing by a corresponding amount.\nIn September 2019, we changed the way in which we present funded public employment-related pension schemes in the PSF statistics. This month we replaced our initial estimates of Pension Protection Fund data with published outturn estimates for the financial years ending March 2019 and 2020. \nThis month we have received provisional outturn data for both current and capital expenditure of local authorities in England for the financial year ending March 2020, that has replaced previous budget forecast data. \nThis month we have received new data for aspects of the public corporations sub-sector that have replaced previous estimates. These include Transport Trading Limited companies for the financial year ending March 2020.\nTable 13 shows the revisions to public sector net debt and net cash requirement presented in this bulletin compared with those presented in the previous bulletin (published on 20 November 2020). \nThis month we have reduced our previously published estimate of public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) at the end of October 2020 by \u00a32.6 billion to \u00a32,074.2 billion, largely because of the update of our estimates of the debt associated with the Pension Protection Fund within the public sector funded pension schemes sub-sector.\nThe revisions to the public sector funded pension schemes\u2019 contribution to net debt extend back to the financial year ending March 2016.\nThis month we have reduced our previously published estimate of public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) expressed as a ratio of GDP at the end of October 2020 by 1.6 percentage points to 99.2%. These revisions to the debt ratio extend back to the financial year ending March 2016.\nIn the five financial years between those ending March 2015 and March 2020, revisions range between positive 0.1 and negative 0.2 percentage points and are the result of updated pensions data. However, from April to October 2020 the revisions are much larger, being reduced by between 0.7 and 1.9 percentage points, largely because of the increase of our estimate of GDP in that period. \nEstimates of GDP used to present public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) and other headline measures are partly based on provisional and official forecast data. \nOctober 2020\u2019s estimate requires data across five quarters of GDP. Of these, two are based on the latest Office for National Statistics published data and three are based on official Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projections (Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 to Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2021).\nOn the 25 November 2020, the OBR published their Economic and fiscal outlook \u2013 November 2020, the first official forecast to consider the impact of COVID-19 on the public sector finances. Most notably, the OBR have increased their estimate of GDP in Quarter 4 2020 by \u00a337.9 billion from that presented in their Fiscal Sustainability Report and summer economic update monthly profiles \u2013 21 August 2020 (XLS, 201KB). \nWe have published an article that explains how estimates of GDP are used to present debt and other headline measures.\n\nPublic sector finances borrowing by sub-sector Dataset | Released 22 December 2020 An extended breakdown of public sector borrowing in a matrix format and estimates of total managed expenditure (TME).

That is, we attempt to record receipts at the point where the liability arose, rather than when the tax is actually paid. \nThis means that accruals-based tax receipts for the current period depend on information from both current cash payments and on projections of future tax receipts, which are \u201caccrued\u201d (or time-adjusted) back to the current month. For this purpose, we use official projections of future cash receipts, produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). \nEstimates of tax receipts presented in this bulletin are partially based on official projections published by the OBR.\nOn the 25 November 2020 the OBR published their Economic and fiscal outlook \u2013 November 2020, the first official forecast to consider the impact of COVID-19 on the public sector finances. \nThe estimates of tax receipts in this release remain partially based on OBR\u2019s Fiscal Sustainability Report and summer economic update monthly profiles \u2013 21 August 2020 (XLS, 201KB), however, we are working with HMRC with the intention of fully incorporating these latest forecasts in the December 2020 Public sector finances release (published on 22 January 2021).\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HM Treasury have been working with both HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the OBR to determine whether there is enough information to make exceptional adjustments that estimate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. \nWhere data are available, we have adjusted the recording of accrued tax receipts (on a national accounts basis) for November and earlier periods. These exceptional adjustments, and their underlying assumptions, will be revisited as more information becomes available. \nPay As You Earn (PAYE) Income Tax is normally recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis by time-adjusting cash receipts using a one-month lag, which means that, for example, accrued PAYE receipts for November are based on forecast December cash receipts. \nThe amount of cash received for PAYE Income Tax in November 2020 was stronger than expected as weakness from lower earnings and employment was offset by repayments of PAYE debt built up over previous months.\nNovember 2020 receipts recorded on an accrued basis are estimated based on the OBR\u2019s FSR, but with some additional adjustments as described in this section.\nWe currently assume that most non-paid tax due between April and November 2020 will still be paid but in a later period than originally expected. We have included a 7% adjustment to reduce expected PAYE receipts on a national accounts basis to account for possible non-payment of PAYE. This assumption is based on the information set out on tax debts and losses in HMRC\u2019s annual report and accounts, and it is based on average losses for the most recent three years of data.\nIn estimating PAYE receipts on an accrued basis for October 2020, we have used additional cash receipts information for November 2020 to inform a judgement on both the non-payment of October liabilities and the repayment of arrears for earlier months.\nValue Added Tax (VAT) data for any month are normally recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis by time-adjusting the average cash receipts expected in the following three months. This means that, for example, VAT receipts on an accrued basis in November depend on forecast cash receipts for December, January and February. These are updated as actual receipts become known.\nThe government announced a deferral scheme for VAT payments, enabling UK businesses to pay VAT due between 20 March and 30 June 2020 at a later date. As a result, cash VAT receipts are lower than usual in this period.\nThe initial assumption is that all the deferred tax owed will still be paid, but in a later period than originally expected, as is permitted under the deferral scheme. We have therefore made an exceptional adjustment to prevent the effects of the deferral scheme on VAT receipts from affecting accrued receipts. \nReceipts forecasts are based on the OBR\u2019s FSR, adjusted to account for the impacts of the deferral scheme. These profiles do not yet consider the announcement on 24 September 2020 that enables companies to opt to spread repayments of deferred VAT across the financial year ending 2022.\nThe existence of this deferral assumption within accrued VAT means that they are subject to revision once further intelligence is gathered on deferred VAT.\nVAT cash receipts are currently substantially outperforming those estimated in OBR\u2019s Fiscal Sustainability Report (FSR) and summer economic update monthly profiles \u2013 21 August 2020 (XLS, 201KB) on which our current forecasts are based. \nIn November 2020, HMRC, ONS, HMT and OBR determined that an exceptional adjustments would be applied to the estimates of accrued VAT receipts for August, September, October and November 2020. These exceptional adjustments are needed because cash receipts in recent months have been higher than was anticipated in the OBR forecasts. We will continue to review and apply adjustments to future months as necessary.\nVAT on an accrued basis should be considered as provisional from December 2019 onwards until a final determination has been made on the deferrals.\nThere are not enough data available yet on which to estimate the amount of VAT that will not be paid because of lower economic activity or businesses ceasing to trade. \nCorporation Tax data for any month are normally recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis by time-adjusting cash receipts for the subsequent 2 to 21 months, depending on the profits of the company. \nAs with PAYE and VAT, estimates of future months\u2019 cash receipts are currently based on the OBR\u2019s FSR. We are not yet able to estimate the amount of Corporation Tax that will not be paid, for example, because of reduced trading activity leading to lower profits, firms deferring tax payments to a future date or firms going out of business. \nThe FSR implicitly includes an element of non-payment through calibration to outturn receipts observed to mid-June 2020.\nThe national accounts estimate of accrued Corporation Tax relies heavily on forecast cash receipts. However, in making these forecasts, there remains uncertainty regarding the amount of Corporation Tax revenue that may never be received. Both cash receipts and accrued receipts should be viewed together for additional context. \nAs with the taxes outlined earlier, estimates of future months\u2019 Air Passenger Duty (APD) cash receipts are currently based on the OBR\u2019s FSR.\nIn estimating APD receipts on an accrued (or national accounts) basis for February to October 2020, we have used additional cash receipts information up to and including November 2020 to inform a judgement on the repayment of arrears.\nAs with the taxes outlined earlier, estimates of future months\u2019 alcohol cash receipts are currently based on the OBR\u2019s FSR.\nIn estimating alcohol receipts on an accrued (or national accounts) basis for February to October 2020, we have used additional cash receipts information up to and including November 2020 to inform a judgement on the repayment of arrears.\nIn December 2020, HMRC, ONS, HMT and OBR determined that an additional exceptional adjustment would be applied to the estimates of accrued alcohol receipts for November and December 2020. These exceptional adjustments mirror those in VAT and are needed because cash receipts in recent months have been higher than was anticipated in the OBR forecasts. We will continue to review and apply adjustments to future months, as necessary.\nOur estimates of National Non-domestic Rates (or business rates) in the current financial year reflect the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government's (MHCLG) initial estimate of impact of the coronavirus pandemic and extended reliefs. These numbers are provisional and do not take into account of proposed repayments of business rates relief by supermarkets. These figures may be revised when further information becomes available. \n", "summary": "Public borrowing in November increased sixfold compared with the same time last year\nUK borrowing was \u00a331.6 billion in November 2020, nearly six times the \u00a35.6 billion borrowed in November 2019 and \u00a33.6 billion more than the \u00a328.0 billion market expectation.\nThis month, central government tax receipts were \u00a338.9 billion, \u00a33.2 billion less than in November 2019; with notable falls in VAT and Business Rates. Central government bodies spent \u00a380.6 billion on their day-to-day activities, \u00a323.5 billion more than a year earlier, including \u00a35.9 billion on its job furlough schemes.\nBorrowing in the first eight months of the financial year-to-November 2020 was \u00a3240.9 billion, more than four times the \u00a357.4 billion borrowed in the whole of 2019 to 2020. Over the same eight-month period net debt increased by \u00a3301.6 billion, reaching \u00a32,099.8 billion at the end of November 2020.\nThis month we have updated our GDP estimates to incorporate the latest official OBR forecasts (published on 25 November 2020). These projections were higher than those previously published and as a result we have revised down our estimates of public sector net debt as a percentage of GDP for recent months to below 100%.\nPublic sector net debt as a ratio of GDP at the end of November 2020 currently stands at around 99.5%, a level last seen in the financial year ending March 1962.\n", "id": 320}, {"document": "In November 2020, retail sales volumes decreased by 3.8% when compared with October as many stores ceased trading following government guidance during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The monthly growth rate for value sales was negative 4.1% and for volume sales negative 3.8%. This ended six consecutive months of growth within the retail sector. \nNovember showed a strong rate of decline following a period of recovery in the aftermath of the initial coronavirus (COVID-19) impact. The reporting period for the November publication covers 1 November to 28 November during which time there were differing restrictions on non-essential retail in each of the regions of the UK. Feedback from retailers stated that these enforced store closures affected turnover despite an increase in online sales during the period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Periods affected by national coronavirus restrictions on non-essential retail\n\nBeginsEnds\nEngland5 November2 December\nScotland*20 November11 December\nWales23 October9 November\n\nNotes\n\n* Restrictions apply to 11 local councils (City of Glasgow, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, East Dunbartonshire, West Dunbartonshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian)\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload this table Table 2: Periods affected by national coronavirus restrictions on non-essential retail\n.xls\n.csv\n\nRestriction announcements for each nation can be found here:\nIn contrast, when compared with a year earlier, both the amount spent and quantity bought reported growth in November 2020, of 1.0% and 2.4% respectively. Non-store volume sales reported the largest year-on-year growth at 42.4%, while food stores also reported a large year-on-year increase of 7.1%.\nIn the three months to November, both value and volume sales increased by 3.0% when compared with the previous three months.\nVolume sales, seasonally adjusted, Great Britain, February 2020 to November 2020\nNotes: \nDownload the data\nFigure 2 shows the volume of sales for each retail sector from February 2020\u2019s pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown level. \nNon-store retailing has showed strength over the course of the pandemic despite a reduction in sales this month. The decline in November 2020 can be attributed to earlier large promotions in October, which significantly increased sales in the sector. Despite this decline, volume sales within non-store retailing remained 42.0% higher than February.\nHousehold goods stores continued to see sales volumes grow in November (1.6%) and are now 15.2% higher than in February 2020. Sales in hardware, paints and glass stores were the main contributor to the monthly growth in November at 16.6%. Feedback from retailers suggested earlier purchases of Christmas products and home DIY goods in preparation for the festive season had boosted turnover.\nFood stores saw sales volumes grow by 3.1% in November when compared with October 2020 and are now 6.8% higher than February 2020 levels. Anecdotal evidence from retailers suggested that food sales have been boosted in November by the restrictions to the hospitality industry and a shift in consumer habits, with an increase in \u201cclick and collect\u201d users boosting sales in the sector. \n\u201cOther\u201d non-food stores, (which includes opticians, chemists, books, games, and jewellery stores) had reported volume sales above February levels for four consecutive months. However, a monthly fall of 10.1% in November saw sales fall below February\u2019s level and they are now 1.4% lower than February levels. \nCarpet and floor covering retailers reported the largest monthly fall of 46.1% in November, while books and newspaper retailers also saw a sharp decline of 40.3%, with feedback from both sectors reporting that store closures had affected turnover. \nClothing retailers reported the sharpest decline in sales volumes in November with a monthly fall of 19.0%. Retailers commented that despite extensive online Black Friday promotions, the enforced closure of stores had affected sales. The sector has struggled to recover from the initial declines witnessed immediately after the first set of national lockdown measures, and remains 30.5% below February\u2019s level.\nFuel stores reported a large decline in volume sales in November with a monthly fall of 16.6%. Anecdotal evidence suggested that lockdown measures had again affected the number of journeys taken by consumers and had an impact on sales. Fuel retailers continue to see sales well below pre-lockdown levels, falling 23.8% below where they were in February 2020. \nWe look at the businesses common between the Retail Sales Inquiry and the Business Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Survey (BICS) during the two weeks from 16 November to 29 November. \nFigure 3 shows the businesses within all retail sectors that were able to continue to trade, despite the enforced closure of non-essential retail stores. 86.9% of businesses stated they were currently trading and had been for more than the last two weeks, suggesting that despite store closures, many were able to continue to trade online. Within department stores, 68.8% stated they had been trading for more than the last two weeks \u2013 the lowest percentage within the retail sector.\nThe closure of non-essential retailers resulted in a movement to online spending during this period (Figure 4).\nTotal retail sales excluding fuel displayed a switch to online sales with the amount spent in stores falling by 6.7%. The amount spent online increased by 6.3% in November when compared with October 2020. \nFood stores, whose physical stores were exempt from the national retail restrictions, reported monthly increases in value sales for both in-store and online sales, at 2.9% and 1.5% respectively. Anecdotal evidence from retailers suggested that food sales have been boosted in November by the restrictions to the hospitality industry and a shift in consumer habits with an increase in \u201cclick and collect\u201d users boosting sales in the sector. \nClothing retailers saw the largest fall in in-store sales with a monthly fall of 33.0%, with only a modest uptake in online sales at 7.9% (Figure 4). \nFigure 5 shows that fuel retailers were the only sector where no respondents reported an increase in turnover during the two weeks 16 November to 29 November. Non-store retailers had the largest proportion of businesses reporting increased sales during the period at 41.2%.\nLooking at the spending patterns over time shows increased spending in the retail industry in the run up to Christmas. Figure 6 shows spending in the retail industry from 2013 when Black Friday first became established in the UK.\nThe timing of Black Friday varies from year to year as do the length of promotional events held by retailers.\nIn 2020, the official Black Friday was on 27 November, falling within our November period, which covers four weeks from 1 November to 28 November. However, Black Friday fell outside our November reporting period in 2019 and was included in the December reporting period.\nWe regularly review our seasonal adjustment approach to ensure we capture any changes in spending owing to seasonal activity. We estimate and remove seasonally related spending so we can show the underlying changes in the economy.\nIn recent years, Black Friday has become a regular occurrence, and for some series there is evidence of a changed seasonal pattern. As this pattern is emerging for some series, it is important to review our seasonal adjustment as new data potentially affected by Black Friday become available. We have therefore carried out a dynamic seasonal adjustment review this month to assess whether our usual adjustment method accurately captures this change in activity. \nStore sectors where the timing of Black Friday was statistically significant in November 2020, owing to the shift in timing related to Black Friday, are:\nelectrical household appliances\nmail order houses (including internet retailers)\nTable 3 shows the month-on-month and year-on-year growth rates for the amount spent online, in addition to the proportion of online sales. The percentage weights indicate where money is spent online.\nIn November 2020, we saw strong growth in value sales across all sectors when compared with the same month a year earlier. Online department store sales increased by 157.2% while household goods stores and \u201cother\u201d non-food stores also saw sales rise by 124.7% each. National measures during November meant physical non-essential stores were closed causing a shift to online purchasing; during this reporting period there were also extensive online Black Friday promotions.\nAll sectors, except non-store retailing, saw an increase in online sales on the month with department stores reporting the largest growth of 24.7%. Feedback from retailers suggests that as well as the impact of physical store closures, there was also evidence that consumers began buying Christmas gifts earlier this year and that promotional activities had increased sales.\nThe proportion of online sales increased to 31.4% compared with the 28.6% reported in October, however this is still lower than the peak witnessed during the first wave of the pandemic in May 2020 when the proportion of online sales reached 33.9%.\n\nRetail Sales Index Dataset | Released 18 December 2020 A series of retail sales data for Great Britain in value and volume terms, seasonally and non-seasonally adjusted.Retail sales pounds data Dataset | Released 18 December 2020 Total sales and average weekly spending estimates for each retail sector in Great Britain in \u00a3 thousands.Retail Sales Index internet sales Dataset | Released 18 December 2020 Internet sales in Great Britain by store type, month and year.Retail Sales Index categories and their percentage weights Dataset | Released 18 December 2020 Retail sales categories and descriptions and their percentage of all retailing in Great Britain.\n\n\n", "summary": "Retail sales fell in November but remained above their pre-pandemic levels\nRetail sales volumes decreased by 3.8% on a monthly basis in November 2020, as many stores were forced to close for at least part of the month.\nDespite the monthly fall, overall sales remained above their levels in February 2020.

These indicators are presented at a Great Britain level in Table 1.\nDownload the data\nCompliance with most measures remained high over Christmas and New Year, with 90% (89% the week before) reporting always or often handwashing after returning home, 97% (97% the week before) using a face covering and 89% (88% the week before) avoiding physical contact when outside their home. Over Christmas and New Year, 88% (86% the week before) of adults reported always or often maintaining social distance when meeting up with other people outside their support bubble.\nFor preventative measures such as handwashing and social distancing, similar percentages were reported for adults in Tiers 3 (very high) and 4 (stay at home) in England. Slightly lower percentages of adults in Tier 4 (stay at home) reported avoiding contact with others outside home and face coverings, however this difference was not statistically significant:\nhandwashing (Tier 4 = 90%, Tier 3 = 89%)\nface coverings (Tier 4 = 95%, Tier 3 = 98%).\navoiding contact with others (Tier 4 = 86%, Tier 3 = 89%)\nThere were some differences in indicators relating to leaving home over Christmas and New Year; a lower proportion of working adults reported travelling to work (exclusively and in combination with working from home) over Christmas and New Year (44%), compared with the week before (57%).\nA higher proportion of adults reported having either stayed at home or only left for work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs in the past 7 days over Christmas and New Year (41%) compared with the week before (32%).\nAround half (51%) of adults in Tier 4 (stay at home) reported that they stayed home or only left for essential reasons (work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs), a higher percentage compared with 39% of adults in Tier 3 (very high).\nOver Christmas and New Year, a lower percentage of adults (14%) reported meeting up with others in a public place in Tier 4 (stay at home) compared with Tier 3 (very high) (18%) and Tier 2 (high) (19%). However, similar proportions were meeting in a personal space (14% in Tier 4 (stay at home), and 13% in Tiers 3 (very high) and 2 (high)).\nOver Christmas and New Year in Great Britain, average personal well-being scores for life satisfaction (6.7) remained the same as the week before, while happiness (6.9) increased slightly compared with the week before, and there was a slight decrease in feeling that things done in life are worthwhile (7.2) and the anxiety score (4).\nGreat Britain, March 2020 to January 2021\nDownload the data\nOver Christmas and New Year, a quarter of adults (25%) felt that life will return to normal in six months or less, compared with 22% the week before.\nOne in five (20%) adults felt that it will take more than a year for life to return to normal, compared with 23% the week before.\nGreat Britain, March 2020 to January 2021\nDownload the data\nFollowing the first coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine being given in the UK on Tuesday 8 December, COVID-19 vaccination is now being provided in hospitals and general practice (GP) surgeries to those most at risk. For links to more information please see the Glossary.\nThere has been a gradual increase in the percentage of adults that reported they would be either very likely or fairly likely to have the COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Over Christmas and New Year more than 8 in 10 (85%) adults reported they would be either very likely or fairly likely to have the COVID-19 vaccine if offered; a slight increase from the week before (82% over the period 16 to 20 December 2020), and an increase from 78% over the period 10 to 13 December 2020. \nOver Christmas and New Year, a further 7% of adults reported that they are very or fairly unlikely to have the COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Among those, the most commonly reported reasons why not were: feeling worried about the side effects (51%), feeling worried about the long-term effects on their health (51%), and wanting to wait to see how well the vaccine works (47%). These are similar reasons reported compared with the previous two data collection periods (10 to 13 December and 16 to 20 December).\nIn selected areas, the UK governments are offering tests for the coronavirus (COVID-19) to everyone living or working in the area, whether they have symptoms or not; this is sometimes referred to \"mass testing\" or \"community testing\".\nOver Christmas and New Year around 8 in 10 (81%) adults in Great Britain reported they strongly supported or tended to support mass testing for COVID-19, a similar percentage to the week before (80% over the period 16 to 20 December). \nIf mass testing were available in their area, around 7 in 10 (71%) of adults said they would be very likely or fairly likely to get a test for COVID-19 even if they had no symptoms; as similar percentage to the week before (72% over the period 16 to 20 December).\nOn 19 December the UK government announced specific rules for the Christmas period. In some parts of the UK, people were able to form an exclusive Christmas bubble on 25 December.\nThe rules were similar, but not identical, across England, Scotland\u00a0and\u00a0Wales. For more information please see the\u00a0Glossary.\nThis week we compare responses on Christmas plans with the actual activities over the Christmas period (25 December to 3 January). For further information on the sub-sample used in this analysis see the Measuring the data section.\nOver the Christmas period, 44% of adults reported that they had formed an exclusive Christmas bubble on 25 December. This was a slightly lower percentage compared with half of adults (50%) who reported over the period 10 to 13 December that they were planning to form a Christmas bubble.\nOver the Christmas period, more than half (55%) of adults reported that they had stayed at home with their household. This was the same percentage compared with those who planned to do so in the survey periods 10 to 13 December, and 16 to 20 December.\nOver the Christmas period, the proportion of adults meeting up with family and friends was lower than the expectations of adults earlier in December.\nOver the Christmas period, 18% of adults reported that they found it very difficult or difficult to follow the government rules. Of those, nearly half (48%) reported that the reason was they had already made plans before the rules for Christmas changed.\nWhen comparing responses among those who reported finding it difficult to follow the government rules before the government\u2019s announcements to responses over the Christmas period, there was a change in the difficulties reported. Over the Christmas period, a higher percentage reported difficulties in following the rules because they wanted to see family or friends on dates other than the 25 December (42%), and wanting to maintain family or Christmas traditions (35%). Over the period 16 to 20 December, a higher percentage reported difficulties in following the rules because it was difficult to choose between friends and family (47%) and to stick to a bubble of only three exclusive households (47%).\n\nCoronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain Dataset | Released 18 December 2020 Indicators from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) to understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain.

Similar rules applied for Scotland and Wales, particularly the message to \"stay at home\", meaning that Great Britain was under a national lockdown at the start of the year in 2021.\nComparisons are made with the experiences of all adults before the national lockdown, specifically between 22 December and 3 January (over Christmas and New Year) when England and Scotland were under local restrictions (tiers), and Wales was under a national set of rules. The definition of tiers is included in the Glossary. Some comparisons are also made with the run up to Christmas between 16 and 20 December.\nThis week, nearly 9 in 10 (88%) adults strongly supported or tended to support the current lockdown measures where they live. This is a 10 percentage point increase from the 78% reported over Christmas and New Year and a further 13 percentage point increase from the 75% reported in the run up to Christmas.\nWhen it comes to following the current lockdown measures where they live, a higher proportion of adults found it very easy or easy to follow the rules (77%) than over Christmas and New Year (68%) and in the run up to Christmas (66%).\nThe percentage of adults finding it very difficult or difficult to follow the current lockdown measures where they live was lower during lockdown this week (9%) compared with over Christmas and New Year (11%) and two weeks ago (12%). However, the most common reasons given for why it was difficult to follow the current lockdown measures were similar for all periods. These were:\nimpact on well-being (78% this week; 76% over Christmas and New Year; 73% in the run up to Christmas)\nstrain on relationships with family and friends (56% this week; 61% over Christmas and New Year; 59% in the run up to Christmas)\nlife events being missed (59% this week; 56% over Christmas and New Year; 62% in the run up to Christmas)\nUnder the current lockdown restrictions, people are required to stay at home except for specific purposes.\nThis week, 9 in 10 (90%) adults said they had left their home for any reason in the past seven days. A higher percentage of adults reported they had left their home over Christmas and New Year (93%) and in the run up to Christmas (95%). Adults in Tier 4 in England over Christmas and New Year reported the same percentage (90%) to this week's national lockdown.\nOver 6 in 10 (62%) stayed at home or only left for a limited set of reasons this week; up from 41% over Christmas and New Year and up from 32% in the run up to Christmas. Please note, this question covers the last 7 days and as a result, estimates for this week may include some activities before the introduction of the latest lockdown. \nThe most common reason to leave home in the past seven days was to go shopping for food and medicine, reported by 72% of adults. This was also the most popular reason over Christmas and New Year (77%) and in the run up to Christmas (77%). As expected over the Christmas and New Year period, a higher proportion of adults reported to have left home to shop for other things (16%) compared with those in lockdown this week (6%).\nA higher proportion of adults reported to leave home for exercise, for example, a walk, run or cycle in the past seven days this week (58%) compared with over Christmas and New Year (52%) and in the run up to Christmas (48%). \nMeeting up in a public place was 11 percentage points lower this week (6%) than over Christmas and New Year (17%) and 13 percentage points lower than in the run up to Christmas (19%).\nMeeting up in a personal place was 10 percentage points lower this week (4%) than over Christmas and New Year (14%) and 3 percentage points lower than in the run up to Christmas (7%).\nThis week, nearly 8 in 10 (78%) adults reported that they were very or somewhat worried about the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on their life right now. A slightly lower percentage was reported by adults over Christmas and New Year (75%) and in the run up to Christmas (72%).\nOver 6 in 10 adults (63%) reported a lack of freedom and independence as the main effect on their life this week, with 64% of adults reporting this over Christmas and New Year, similar to those in higher tiers in England over this period (Tier 3: 66%, Tier 4: 66%). In the run up to Christmas, 62% reported a lack of freedom and independence as the main effect on their life.\nOver half (56%) of adults reported that their well-being was being affected (for example, boredom, loneliness, anxiety and stress) by the coronavirus pandemic. This was a higher percentage to those over Christmas and New Year (53%) and for adults living in Tiers 3 (53%) and Tier 4 (54%) in England during this period. Adults reporting an effect on their well-being this week were also higher than in the run up to Christmas (51%).\nThis week, 53% of working adults reported that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was affecting their work. This is an increase from 47% over Christmas and New Year, which might be expected with people taking time off work over Christmas. However, the percentage was still higher this week than in the run up to Christmas (49%).\nNearly half (48%) of working adults reported travelling to work (exclusively and in combination with working from home). This is an increase from 44% over Christmas and New Year and in the run up to Christmas, 57%. Looking at the tiers structure in England, decreasing proportions were seen in areas of higher tier restrictions over Christmas and New Year (Tier 2: 58%, Tier 3: 49% and Tier 4: 30%).\nA higher percentage of working adults (43%) reported working from home because of the coronavirus pandemic in the past seven days, compared with Christmas and New Year (32%) and the run up to Christmas (39%).\nIt is worth noting that a proportion of working adults not travelling to work or working from home over Christmas and New Year will be because of the Christmas holiday period.\n\nCoronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain Dataset | Released 15 January 2021 Indicators from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) to understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain.

The beginning of 2020 saw a pick-up in annual growth in the housing market before the coronavirus restrictions were put in place at the end of March 2020.\nPrice variations at the beginning of 2020 may reflect the unusual conditions in the housing market at the time. People were advised not to move house during the tightest restrictions in April and May. As such, property transactions completed during that time may have been more concentrated than usual among those without complicating factors, such as a chain. For example, first-time buyers \u2013 typically at the lower end of the price scale \u2013 may have been freer to complete transactions than former owner-occupiers, who may have had to co-ordinate multiple sales during lockdown.\nRecent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations.\nPent-up demand may have contributed towards an increase in house prices. The Bank of England\u2019s Money and Credit November 2020 release reported that mortgage approvals for house purchases (an indicator of future lending) increased further in November 2020 to 105,000, the highest since August 2007.\nThe pandemic may have also caused house buyers to reassess their housing preferences.

These were up from 4.6% (London) and 6.7% (Yorkshire and The Humber) in the year to October 2020 (Figure 4).\nThe lowest annual growth was in the East of England, where average prices increased by 4.8% over the year to November 2020.\nLondon\u2019s average house prices remain the most expensive of any region in the UK at an average of \u00a3514,000 in November 2020. This is a record high and the first time London\u2019s average house prices have surpassed \u00a3500,000.\nLondon\u2019s annual house price growth has followed a sharp upward trend seen in most regions in recent months, likely reflecting a range of factors including pent-up demand, changes in housing preferences and the temporary reduction in property transaction taxes, which are due to end on 31 March 2021.\nLooking at the picture within London, house prices have grown more quickly in Inner London than Outer London for some time. In November 2020, two London boroughs had annual house price growth above 20%, one is in Inner London (Kensington and Chelsea, at 28.6%), while the Outer London borough of Brent had annual price growth of 23.9%. The annual growth rate in Brent is partly caused by a base effect as the average house price decreased by 11.9% between October and November 2019 and increased by 2.8% between October and November 2020.\nDemand for property in Inner London may be particularly responsive to temporary property tax changes as property prices are high and therefore so is the corresponding tax to be paid. In addition, compared with other regions of the UK, London has a relatively high proportion of properties bought for investment, including from cash buyers and overseas investors. As such, demand for property in Inner London is likely influenced by a broader range of factors than the rest of the UK, including the forthcoming introduction of additional property tax for non-UK residents and geopolitical circumstances such as the new route to UK citizenship for British Nationals Overseas in Hong Kong, being introduced in January 2021, both of which may push up demand for properties in Inner London.\nThe North East continued to have the lowest average house price, at \u00a3140,000, and is the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007 (Figure 5).\n\n\nFigure 5: The North East is the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007\nAverage house price, by English region, January 2005 to November 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: HM Land Registry and Office for National Statistics \u2013 UK House Price Index\n\nNotes:\n\nData at the local authority level and other breakdowns can be found in the full House Price Index (HPI) release, available to download from HM Land Registry at GOV.UK.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 5: The North East is the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\n\nUK House Price Index Dataset | Released 20 January 2021 Monthly house price movements, including average price by property type, sales and cash mortgage sales, as well as information on first-time buyers, new builds and former owner occupiers.

This is the highest annual growth rate the UK has seen since June 2016.\nPent-up demand may have contributed towards an increase in house prices. The Bank of England\u2019s Money and Credit November 2020 release reported that mortgage approvals for house purchases (an indicator of future lending) increased further in November 2020 to 105,000, the highest since August 2007.\nThe pandemic may have also caused house buyers to reassess their housing preferences.

The latest bulletin reports that the percentage testing positive remained at high levels in England but decreased slightly in the week ending 16 January 2021 (between 10 and 16 January). \nThis section provides the modelled estimates on positivity rates by patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles by age; with the two occupational groups split between those aged under 35 years and those 35 years and above. The modelling used is similar to that used to produce national trend modelling of COVID-19 infections in our weekly bulletin. More information about the methods used in the model is available in our methodology article.\nThe models used to produce positivity rates for patient-facing and non-patient-facing roles include only swab test results from individuals aged 16 to 74 years. This analysis covers the time period between 1 September 2020 and 9 January 2021.\nIn the week ending 9 January 2021, the percentage of those testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) increased in both those aged under 35 years, and 35 years and above, who work in a patient-facing role. The percentage testing positive recently decreased in both age groups in a non-patient-facing role. However, overall there is no statistical evidence of difference in levels of positivity between patient-facing and non-patient facing role, except those over 35 years old and in a non-patient-facing role. \nThis contrasts with analysis in our previous article published in December, where the proportion of those testing positive had decreased in all groups apart from those in a patient-facing role aged 35 years and over, where there was less certainty in the direction of the trend.\nSwabs are tested for three genes present in the coronavirus: N protein, S protein and ORF1ab. Each swab can have any one, any two or all three genes detected. Positives are those where one or more of these genes is detected in the swab other than tests that are only positive on the S-gene, which is not considered a reliable indicator of the virus if found on its own.\nThe new UK variant of COVID-19 has genetic changes in the S-gene. This means the S-gene is no longer detected in the current test, and cases that would have previously been positive on all three genes are now positive only on the ORF1ab and the N-gene (not the S-gene). More information on the new variant can be found in Section 10 in our latest bulletin. \nThe analysis in this section looks at each person who tests positive for COVID-19 who had a strong positive test. The strength of the test is determined by how quickly the virus is detected, measured by a cycle threshold (Ct) value. The lower the Ct value, the higher the viral load and stronger the positive test. Positive results with a high Ct value could be seen in the early stages of infection when virus levels are rising, or late in the infection, when the risk of transmission is low. \nThis analysis considers cases that had a Ct value less than 30, between 15 November 2020 and 16 January 2021, split by whether this is compatible with the new UK variant (positive only on two of the genes in the test, the N-gene and ORF1ab) or positive on all three genes (the N-gene, the S-gene and ORF1ab), and considers what percentage of these individuals reported symptoms. You can find more information on Ct values in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\nIndividuals taking part in the survey were asked whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms1 in the seven days before they were tested and also separately whether they felt that they had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection in the last seven days. \nIn Figure 2 we have categorised reported symptoms into the following:\nany: all reported symptoms, including reporting symptoms compatible with COVID-19 whilst not naming specific symptoms\nclassic: cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste or loss of smell\ngastrointestinal (GI): abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea\nloss of taste or smell only\nPeople testing positive compatible with the new UK variant were more likely to report any symptoms and the classic symptoms, but were less likely to report loss of taste and smell. There was no evidence of difference in the percentages reporting gastrointestinal symptoms.\nFigure 3 indicates that loss of taste and loss of smell were significantly less common in new variant compatible positives than triple positives; whereas other symptoms were more common in new variant compatible positives, with the largest differences for cough, sore throat, fatigue, myalgia and fever. There is no evidence of difference in the gastrointestinal symptoms, shortness of breath or headaches.\nAdditional analysis has been conducted on the estimated percentage of self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms over time in England and by CIS area, by our academic partners at the University of Oxford. \nThis section looks at how often individuals are reporting social contact (either socially distanced or physical contact) with other people outside their own household. We asked individuals how many people aged 17 years and under, 18 to 69 years, and 70 years and over, outside their household, they have had contact with up to seven days prior to each visit. \u201cContact\u201d refers to either of the following:\nsocially distanced contact \u2013 direct contact with social distancing only\nphysical contact \u2013 physical contact, such as a handshake or personal care, including wearing PPE\nThis analysis covers the time period between 27 July 2020 and 11 January 2021. We have produced estimates that have been weighted to be representative of the total population in England. Analysis includes all people taking part in the survey, and is presented for school age children (age 2 years to school Year 11) and adults (school Year 12 and above). We report the number of contacts in the following groups:\n0 (no reported contact)\n1 to 5 (reported contacts)\n6 to 10 (reported contacts)\n11 to 20 (reported contacts)\n21 or more (reported contacts)\nWe present the proportion of school age children by each category of socially distanced contact in Figure 4. Our analysis suggests that there was an increase in \u201c21 or more\u201d socially distanced contacts with people aged 17 years and under from September 2020 onwards, corresponding to school age individuals returning to school and coming into contact with their peers. In early January 2021, socially distanced contacts decreased as schools closed in lockdown. \nThere was a decrease in the number of socially distanced contacts with people aged 17 years and under in late October to early November 2020 and in late December, corresponding to the half term and Christmas breaks from school. In November, the proportion of socially distanced contacts returned to a similar number of contacts seen before half-term, but this did not happen in January as schools remained closed.\nThere is a similar pattern of increased socially distanced contacts with people aged 18 to 69 years from September 2020 onwards, which is likely to relate to the increased contact with teachers and parents. In early January, the number of socially distanced contacts decreased as schools closed.\nOver time, the number of socially distanced contacts with people who are over 70 years has decreased. There was some evidence of a slight rise in those reporting 1 to 5 contacts in late December, potentially because of some rules relaxing at Christmas.\nAmong adults, the number of socially distanced contacts of all ages has decreased over time since September to October 2020. In December, socially distanced contacts may have risen slightly as the November lockdown ended. The number of socially distanced contacts has decreased again in January. \nThe trends in physical contacts among school age children are very similar to socially distanced contacts trends, aligning to schools returning in September 2020. \nThe proportion of physical contact increased from September, however, this increase was proportionally less than the increase in socially distanced contact seen in Figure 3. In January 2021, the proportion of physical contact across ages decreased as the country went into lockdown and schools were closed.\nTrends in physical contacts over time in adults are very similar to socially distanced contact trends, but there are more respondents that have had contact with zero individuals. Across all ages of physical contacts, in adults the number of physical contacts has decreased over time from September and October. \nAdditional information on the proportions of physical contacts by school age children and adults can be found in the accompanying dataset. \nRegionally there is little variation in the number of socially distanced contacts. In all regions there is a clear decrease in socially distanced contact with six or more people in the most recent 14-day period because of the national lockdown restrictions. \nThere is also low variation by region in the number of physical contacts people have reported. In all regions there is a clear decrease in the number of physical contacts in the most recent 14-day period because of national lockdown restrictions. Additional information on regional differences between socially distanced and physical contacts can be found in the accompanying dataset. \nMore information on socially-distanced and physical contact is also available in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which examines the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain. \nThe analysis in this section looks at the percentage of people aged 16 and 17 years (school Year 12) to age 24 years who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), between 1 September 2020 and 9 January 2021, split by employment status. The modelling used is similar to that used to produce national trend modelling of COVID-19 infections in our weekly bulletin. More information about the methods used in the model is available in our methodology article.\nFor this analysis, we have split employment status into three categories: \nemployed: includes everyone in full-time and part-time employment and those who are self-employed\nstudent: includes anyone who is in full-time education\nother: includes people who are furloughed or not working, such as those who are unemployed and long-term sick\nIn this age group, the percentage testing positive is currently highest for people who are employed. However, this has varied over time and the percentage testing positive was highest for students during October 2020.\nIn recent weeks, the percentage testing positive has been increasing among both employed individuals and students in this age group.\nCaution should be taken in over-interpreting the trend in the \u201cOther\u201d category because of wide credible intervals.\nAs this analysis only includes people in school Year 12 to 24 years, sample sizes are smaller and modelling is therefore more challenging. This can lead to a higher level of uncertainty around the modelled trends. \n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) infections in the community in England  Dataset | Released 27 January 2021  Characteristics of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) in England taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.

There was no evidence of difference in the percentages reporting gastrointestinal symptoms.\nThis is according to a survey of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in England between 15 November 2020 and 16 January 2021. More information about the new UK variant of COVID-19 is available in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 22 January 2021.\nIndividuals taking part in the survey were asked whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms in the seven days before they were tested, and separately whether they felt that they had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection in the last seven days.\nWe have categorised reported symptoms as follows:\n - any: all reported symptoms, including general reporting of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (not naming specific symptoms)\n - classic: cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste or loss of smell\n - gastrointestinal (GI): abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea\n - loss of taste or smell only\nMeanwhile, the analysis published today shows that the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 has decreased in non-patient facing job roles in England.

The quarterly data in this release are broadly in line and provide new evidence using new methods. \n\n\n\nBusiness closures are those removed from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) - a database of all businesses in the UK registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) and/or the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) income tax system, used as a sampling frame for ONS business surveys. A business is removed from the IDBR if its turnover and employment are zero for several periods, or the ONS is notified the business has ceased trading through an administrative source. These are referred to as business deaths in our annual business demography publication and other data. For more information see the Measuring the data and Glossary sections.\nThe number of business closures in the UK in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 was significantly higher than in Quarter 4 2019, and is the highest figure of all the Quarter 4 closures in the four years for which data are available.\u00a0 This follows two quarters for which the number of business closures was low.\nIt takes a relatively long time for a business to be removed from the IDBR, which may happen several months after the effective closure of the business. The legal and statistical processes are complex and are explained in more detail in the Measuring the data and Strengths and limitations sections.\nData from our annual business demography publication demonstrate that many businesses are added to, and removed from, the IDBR every year, so it is the extent to which this figure is greater than expected that we are interested in in order to identify an impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Looking at the annual figures we see that the total number of business closures figure in 2020 is almost 17% higher than the average number of closures in the last three years.\nHowever, the number of closures in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020 (pre-pandemic in terms of any COVID-19 impact on register business creations and closures) is very high, which is boosting the annual number of closures in 2020.\u00a0 There is some evidence that a larger number of single employee companies were closed in Quarter 1 2020, and it is possible that this is due to those businesses getting ready for changes to taxation rules on contracting.\nIf we remove the first quarters from the calculation in all of the years 2017 to 2020 and only look at Quarters 2 (Apr to June) to 4 there is an increase of almost 10% in the number of closures in 2020 compared to the average of 2017 to 2019.\u00a0 Similarly, there is a 5% increase in business closures for 2020 Quarters 2 to 4 compared to 2019 Quarters 2 to 4.\nBusiness closures appear to be seasonal: there tend to be more in the first half of the year than in the second half. This is true for most industries and regions.\nBusinesses in the information and communication industry (SIC07 section J) made up a larger proportion of all businesses removed from the IDBR in Quarter 4 2020 than in Quarter 4 2019. This continues a pattern first seen in Quarter 2 2020.\nBy contrast, businesses in the accommodation and food services industry made up a smaller share of business closures in Quarter 4 2020 than usual. This is despite this industry being adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic in the short term. This may be due to measures taken by the government to support industries through the pandemic.\nThe regional distribution of business closures is fairly stable in recent periods, with no region particularly standing out as taking a greater share of closures.\nThe average size of businesses that were removed from the IDBR in Quarter 4 2020, based on their employment, was 2.6, which is smaller than the figures seen in Quarter 4 for 2017 to 2019 and is almost 14% smaller than the average employment for closures in Quarter 4 2019.\nMonthly data from the insolvency service shows that in November the number of insolvencies remained low.\nData from Companies House are available only up to Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2020, and at that time company dissolutions were down 21% compared with Quarter 3 2019.\u00a0 However, Companies House state that during September 2020 they restarted the voluntary strike-off process.\u00a0 This may be one of the reasons Quarter 4 deaths are relatively strong on IDBR.\nBusiness creations are new enterprise entries onto the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR). These are referred to as business births in our annual business demography publication, and other data. For more information see the Measuring the data and Glossary sections.\nThe number of business creations in the UK in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 was up 24% on Quarter 4 2019 (Figure 2), following on from a relatively strong number of business creations in Quarter 3 (July to Sept). This is contrary to expectations that business creation would be lower due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThere is typically a shorter lag in adding businesses to the IDBR after the effective creation of the business, than there is for removing businesses from the IDBR after their effective closure. As such, the rebound in births which started in Quarter 3 2020 is likely to reflect a genuine trend for increased business creation.\nIndustries which showed the greatest increases in business creations, Quarter 4 2020 on Quarter 4 2019, were business administration and support, retail, professional and scientific, and transportation and storage.\u00a0\u00a0 In Quarter 4 we have seen an increase of the share of all creations by sole proprietors.\nThe retail industry continued the strong growth shown in Quarter 3 2020 into Quarter 4. This is likely to be due to an increase in online retailers, since there has been a large increase in online retail sales during the pandemic.\nThe number of businesses created in the health and social care industry continues to be at much lower levels from the start of the pandemic (around a third of the pre-pandemic levels). \u00a0Further significant falls on the same quarter a year ago are seen in the education, arts and entertainment, accommodation and foods services, and construction industries. These were all industries negatively affected by the pandemic. \u00a0\u00a0\nBusiness creations continue at low levels since the pandemic in the information and communication industry, but finance and insurance shows signs of recovering to near normal levels in Quarter 4 following two quarters of low creations.\nThe proportion of business creations in each country and region of the UK was similar in Quarter 4 2020 to that of Quarter 4 2019. \nBusinesses added to the IDBR in Quarter 4 2020 were substantially smaller on average, based on turnover and employment, than in the same quarter in the past few years (Figure 4). These data are in part based on predictions made when the company is registered and may therefore reflect expectations of harder trading conditions for new businesses in 2020. They may also reflect the types of businesses being created.\nBetween 2017 and 2019, the average new business created in Quarter 4 had around 3.5 employees. This fell to 2.7 employees in Quarter 4 2020. This fall reflects smaller average sizes in most industries.\u00a0 It also reflects that businesses are being created to a greater extent than before in industries where only a small number of employees are required, for example online retailing.\nWe publish the number of new VAT returners monthly in our Faster Indicators release, including the figure for December published on 14 January. These show a pick-up in VAT registrations in Quarters 3 and 4 of 2020 after a big drop in April to June 2020.\nWeekly indicators of company incorporations using Companies House data in our weekly Faster Indicators publication also show an increase in business creations in the weeks of Quarter 4 2020, relative to the same time last year.\n\nBusiness demography, quarterly experimental statistics, UK  Dataset | Released 27 January 2021  Experimental quarterly statistics on business creations or births and closures or deaths from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) with high-level breakdowns by industry and region. \n\n\n", "summary": "Business closures up 37% on 2019 in the final quarter of 2020\nBusiness closures in the last three months of 2020 were 37% higher than in the same period in 2019.\nFigures for Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 show business creations were also 24% higher than 2019.\nThe Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) gives an indication of how many companies have closed or started up, based on businesses added to or removed from the register.\nAll industries, except motor trades, had a higher number of business closures in Quarter 4 2020 than in Quarter 4 2019.\nOf businesses removed from the register in Quarter 4 2020, a larger proportion than last year were in the information and communication industry, a pattern seen since Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020.\nBy contrast, businesses in the accommodation and food services industry made up a smaller share of business closures in Quarter 4 2020 than usual. This may be because of measures taken by the government to support industries through the pandemic.\nSectors with the largest increases in new businesses this quarter, year-on-year, were business services, retail, professional and scientific industries, and transportation and storage.\nNumbers of new businesses have fallen in other sectors such as health and social care, education, arts and entertainment, accommodation and food, and construction.\n", "id": 351}, {"document": "In England, the percentage of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) has continued to decrease in the week ending 19 February 2021; we estimate that 373,700 people within the community population in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 346,400 to 401,300), equating to around 1 in 145 people.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive has continued to decrease in the week ending 19 February 2021; we estimate that 14,700 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 11,100 to 18,800), equating to around 1 in 205 people.\nIn Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive has continued to decrease in the week ending 19 February 2021; we estimate that 9,500 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 6,600 to 13,100), equating to around 1 in 195 people.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has continued to decrease in the week ending 19 February 2021; we estimate that 23,400 people in Scotland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 18,600 to 29,000) equating to around 1 in 225 people.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat.

The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest five.\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\nAs this is a household survey, our figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In these settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different.

We include different measures to support our estimation and the below outlines the appropriate uses of all of the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate and is used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way.\nInformation about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our\u00a0methods article.\nWe are continuously refining and looking to improve our modelling and presentations.

This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive has decreased in all regions except Yorkshire and The Humber where the trend is uncertain in the week ending 19 February 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nData download\nThe percentage of people testing positive by region was calculated using a similar modelling approach to the national daily estimates in Section 2: Number of people in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who had COVID-19.\nThe analysis is conducted over a six-week period, which means specific positive cases move into and then out of the sample. This causes variability between estimates over time, which is expected given the lower number of positive tests within each region, compared with England as a whole.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) for regions in England are available in our dataset and provide an alternative measure over time for context.\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates for the most recent week of data (between 13 and 19 February 2021) at the sub-regional level.\n\n!\n\nThe analysis in this section presents modelled estimates for the most recent week of data at the sub-regional level for the UK. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was lower relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in these estimates; caution should be taken and the uncertainty of the estimates and wide credible intervals taken into account when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nData download\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether they are in school Year 6 or 7 (birthday before or after 1 September).\nSimilarly, 16- to 17-year-olds are split depending on whether they are in school Years 11 or 12 (birthday before or after 1 September).\u00a0\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in the different ages who tested positive for COVID-19 was lower relative to England overall.

We have estimated incidence by directly measuring when a participant in our study who has previously tested negative, subsequently tests positive, and comparing this with the number of participants who remain negative.\nWhen enrolled on the survey, participants are swabbed weekly for five weeks and then move to monthly swabbing. Increasing the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey sample size to 150,000 participants per fortnight enabled the majority of participants to be swabbed weekly, providing us with regular and timely updates on the number of new infections and the \"time at risk\". The proportion swabbed monthly has now increased and we have reviewed our estimation of incidence, determining options that will adapt our approach to reflect changes in data capture and survey design. We committed to regular reviews of our methods and survey design as part of our ongoing quality assurance process to ensure our estimates remain of the highest quality possible and continue to meet our user needs. This review ensures we will continue to provide an accurate estimate of incidence and to make sure our statistics continue to be of high quality. We will confirm a date for publication of our reviewed estimates nearer the time.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The new UK variant of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes which coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the new UK variant, the S-gene is no longer detected by the current test. When there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious) absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab- and N-genes) is a reliable indicator of the new UK variant in COVID-19. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of the new UK variant.\nIn contrast, the South African variant has an S-gene that is detectable with the current test and will therefore be included in the \"not compatible with new UK variant\" group of COVID-19 where the virus level is high enough to identify this. Which of these types of COVID-19 are compatible with the South African variant cannot be identified from the swab PCR test alone. You can\u00a0read more about the new UK variant\u00a0in our recent blog.\nThis analysis looks at the percentage of positive tests that are compatible with the new UK variant of the virus across the UK.\n\n!\n\nData should be treated with caution. In particular, there are small numbers of positives detected in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland leading to considerable uncertainty surrounding these estimates. There are further uncertainties given that not all cases that are positive on the ORF1ab- and N-genes will be the new UK variant. \n\n\n\nIn England the percentage of people testing positive with all variants of the virus continued to decrease in the week ending 19 February 2021.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive with all variants of the virus has decreased in the week ending 19 February 2021.\nIn Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive with all variants of the virus has decreased in the week ending 19 February 2021.\nIn Scotland, both the percentage of people testing positive that were compatible with the new UK variant and were not compatible with the new UK variant have decreased in the week ending 19 February 2021. The percentage of people testing positive where the virus level was too low for the variant to be identifiable has likely remained level in the week ending 19 February 2021.\nData download\nIn the week ending 19 February 2021, the percentage of people testing positive that were clearly not compatible with the new UK variant decreased in all regions, except for in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the South East where the trends are uncertain. The South African variant would fall into the \"clearly not compatible with the new UK variant\" category, as cases compatible with the South African variant would test positive on all three genes.\nIn the week ending 19 February 2021, the percentage of people testing positive that were compatible with the new UK variant decreased in all regions, except for Yorkshire and The Humber where the trend is uncertain. Cases where the virus was too low for the variant to be identifiable have decreased in all regions, except the North East and Yorkshire and The Humber where the trends are uncertain. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nData download\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low, under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on\u00a0sensitivity and specificity in our methods article. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey Dataset | Released 26 February 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

This was 15,747 more deaths than in January 2020 and 15,685 deaths more than the five-year average (2015 to 2019). The five-year average has been provided for 2015 to 2019 (rather than 2016 to 2020) because of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on deaths registered in 2020. The average for 2015 to 2019 provides a comparison of the number of deaths expected per month in a usual (non-pandemic) year. Of the deaths registered in January 2021, 34,903 were males and 33,893 were females.\nIn Wales, the provisional number of deaths registered in January 2021 was 4,431. This was 878 more deaths than in January 2020 and 904 more deaths than the five-year average for January. Of the deaths registered in January in Wales, there were 2,254 male deaths and 2,177 female deaths.\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) are used for comparisons over time rather than numbers of deaths, as ASMRs account for changes to the population size and age structure. In England, January 2002 was the year with the highest mortality rate since our data time series began in 2001. Since then, mortality rates in England for the month of January had been generally decreasing from 1,581.7 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002, to a low of 1,034.2 deaths per 100,000 people in January 2016. The\u00a0statistically significant\u00a0decrease in age-standardised mortality rates from 2002 was seen in both males and females (Figure 1). But since 2019, the mortality rate has increased each year.\nIn England, the January 2021 mortality rate (1,462.0 deaths per 100,000 people) was significantly higher than the mortality rate in every year back to January 2003 (but significantly lower than January 2002 and January 2001, the highest mortality rates in this analysis). The mortality rate in January 2021 was 1,729.9 deaths per 100,000 males (compared with 1,908.9 in January 2002) and 1,245.5 deaths per 100,000 females (compared with 1,357.0 in January 2002).\nIn Wales, 2001 was the year with the highest January mortality rate since our data time series began in 2001. Over time, mortality rates in Wales have decreased from 1,626.5 deaths per 100,000 people in January 2001 to a low of 1,114.0 deaths per 100,000 people in January 2016. In January 2021, the mortality rate significantly increased (compared with January 2020) to 1,537.2 deaths per 100,000 people; with both males and females experiencing an increase in deaths. The January 2021 mortality rate was significantly higher than the mortality rate in every year back to January 2009.\nThe doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death. Using this information, we determine an underlying cause of death. More information on this process can be found in our\u00a0user guide.\nIn January in most cases (89.8% in England and 89.9% in Wales) where the coronavirus (COVID-19) was mentioned on the death certificate, it was found to be the underlying cause of death. For more information on our definition of COVID-19 deaths, see\u00a0Section 10: Measuring the data.\n\n!\n\nIn this bulletin, we use the term \"due to COVID-19\" when referring only to deaths with an underlying cause of death of COVID-19 and we use the term \"involving COVID-19\" when referring to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether as an underlying cause or not. \n\n\n\nOf the 68,796 deaths registered in January 2021 in England, 37.4% (25,716 deaths) were due to COVID-19. This is the highest proportion seen in England since the pandemic began, overtaking April 2020 when 33.5% of all deaths were due to COVID-19. Taking into account all deaths involving COVID-19 increases the percentage to 41.6% of all deaths (28,650 deaths) in England in January 2021.\nIn Wales, 35.2% of the 4,431 deaths registered in January 2021 were due to COVID-19 (1,561 deaths), the highest proportion seen in Wales since the pandemic began, overtaking April 2020 when 30.1% of all deaths were due to COVID-19. Taking into account all deaths involving COVID-19 increases the percentage to 39.2% of all deaths (1,736 deaths) in Wales.\nWhen adjusting for the size and age structure of the population, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths due to COVID-19 in both England and Wales have increased significantly each month between October 2020 and January 2021 (Figure 2). In England, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly increased for the fifth consecutive month, with a rate of 545.9 deaths per 100,000 people in January 2021. In Wales, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly increased for the fourth consecutive month, with a rate of 539.1 deaths per 100,000 people in January 2021.\nIn England, although mortality rates due to COVID-19 have increased between September 2020 and January 2021, these remain significantly lower than in April 2020 when the COVID-19 mortality rate was the highest. In England, the ASMR due to COVID-19 in January 2021 was 12.4% lower than in April 2020 (623.2 deaths per 100,000 people). However, in Wales, the highest ASMR due to COVID-19 was experienced in January 2021, 8.9% higher than in April 2020 (increasing from a rate of 495.1 deaths per 100,000 people to 539.1 deaths per 100,000 people).\nIn England, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly increased for the fifth consecutive month for both males (675.4 per 100,000 males) and females (446.0 per 100,000 females) in January 2021. In Wales, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly increased for the fourth consecutive month for both males (671.2 per 100,000 males) and females (436.5 per 100,000 females) in January 2021.\nIn England, mortality rates due to COVID-19 remained significantly lower than April 2020 (838.3 per 100,000 males and 458.6 per 100,000 females; when the COVID-19 mortality rate was the highest). However, in Wales, the highest ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began was experienced in January 2021 for both males (671.2 per 100,000 males) and females (436.5 per 100,000 females). More information on mortality rates by sex is available in Tables 3a and 3b of the accompanying dataset.\nSuper Output Areas (SOAs)\u00a0are small-area statistical geographies covering England and Wales. Each area has a similarly sized population and remains stable over time. For this analysis, Middle layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) have been used. The\u00a0accompanying dataset shows the number of deaths from all causes as well as deaths due to COVID-19.\nThe following interactive map allows you to see the cumulative number of monthly deaths due to COVID-19 in each area.\n1. Points on the map are placed at the centre of the local area they represent and do not show the actual location of deaths. The size of the circle is proportional to the number of deaths.  2. To protect confidentiality, a small number of deaths have been reallocated between neighbouring areas. Given the method used for this, figures for some areas may be different to previously published data. 3. Figures are for deaths registered rather than deaths occurring in each month.  4. Figures exclude death of non-residents; geographical boundaries are based on the most up-to-date information available at the time of publication.  5. Deaths \"due to COVID-19\" include only deaths where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death.  6. Locally adopted Middle-layer Super Output Area (MSOA) names are provided by House of Commons Library. While these names are not officially supported for National Statistics, they are provided here to help local users.  7. Figures are provisional.\nDownload the data\nOur\u00a0leading causes of death groupings\u00a0are based on a list developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This categorises causes of death using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) into groups that are epidemiologically more meaningful than single ICD-10 codes, for the purpose of comparing the most common causes of death in the population.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the 10 most common underlying causes of death registered in January 2021 for England and Wales, compared with the five-year average for January (2015 to 2019).\nIn both England and Wales, the coronavirus (COVID-19) was the leading cause of death in January 2021, with 545.9 deaths per 100,000 people in England (25,716 deaths) and 539.1 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales (1,561 deaths). This was the third consecutive month where COVID-19 was the leading cause of death. \nThe rate of deaths due to COVID-19 was significantly higher than the next-leading cause of death in both England and Wales. In England, the second most common cause of death in January 2021 was dementia and Alzheimer's disease, with 119.4 deaths per 100,000 people in England (5,655 deaths). In Wales, the second most common cause of death was ischaemic heart diseases, with 129.0 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales (370 deaths). The COVID-19 mortality rate was more than four times the second-leading cause of death in both England and Wales.\nIn England in January 2021, 8 of the 10 leading causes of death were significantly lower than the five-year average (2015 to 2019), with only signs, symptoms and ill-defined conditions having a similar mortality rate to the five-year average. In particular, the mortality rate for deaths with an underlying cause of Influenza or Pneumonia were 70.0% lower in January 2021 than the five-year average for January. In Wales, 6 of the 10 leading causes were significantly lower than the five-year average, with signs, symptoms and ill-defined conditions, malignant neoplasm of colon, sigmoid and rectum and anus, and heart failure and complications and ill-defined heart disease having similar mortality rates. Similar to England, the January 2021 mortality rate for flu and pneumonia was 69.4% lower than the five-year average. \nGenerally, since 2001 (the beginning of our data time series), the age-standardised mortality rates for people aged both 0 to 74 years and 75 years and over have been decreasing in England and Wales. However, similar to the trend seen in all ages (Section 2), mortality rates in both England and Wales have increased in 2020 and 2021 for age group 75 and over and in England for the under 75 age group. More information on mortality rates by sex and age group (including age-specific mortality rates by five-year age group for people aged 75 years and over) is available in Tables 5 to 9 of the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nThis section is based on the date a death occurred - rather than the date of registration used in the previous sections - to monitor current mortality trends. Analysis of deaths by date of registration is useful as the figures are comparable across time and geography. Because of the\u00a0length of time that it takes a death to be registered, using data based on registration can mean that we are not monitoring the most current death trends. For example, a death registered in January 2021 could have occurred in a previous month or even a previous year. Further information regarding death occurrences and registration delays can be found in\u00a0Section 10: Measuring the data.\nBetween 1 January and 31 January 2021, 66,494 deaths occurred in England (and were registered by 8 February 2021). This was 14,640 more deaths than the five-year average (2015 to 2019) for January (28.2% higher). Of the 66,494 deaths that occurred, 41.0% were due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) (27,273 deaths).\nIn Wales, 4,179 deaths occurred in January 2021 (and were registered by 8 February 2021), which was 753 more deaths than the five-year average (22.0% higher). COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death in 36.6% of all deaths that occurred (1,529 deaths).\nIn England, the first death due to COVID-19 occurred on 30 January 2020 (Figure 6). Since 11 March, the number of COVID-19 deaths occurring on each day rose (except for 6 April 2020, when it decreased by 14 deaths) until the peak of 1,223 deaths that occurred on 8 April 2020. Since 8 April, the number of COVID-19 deaths each day had generally been decreasing but began increasing again from mid-September. The number of daily COVID-19 deaths has continued to increase reaching 1,150 deaths on 19 January 2021 (the highest since 11 April 2020 at 1,157 deaths). The number of death occurrences on more recent dates is likely to rise as we receive more death registrations.\nIn Wales, the first death with an underlying cause of COVID-19 occurred on 15 March. As in England, the number of COVID-19 deaths per day reached the peak on 8 April 2020, when 70 deaths due to COVID-19 occurred in Wales. Since 8 April, the number of COVID-19 deaths occurring each day in Wales had been gradually decreasing, with no COVID-19 deaths occurring on 41 days between June and September. However, daily COVID-19 deaths increased throughout October, November, December 2020 and January 2021, with 74 deaths occurring on 11 January 2021 (though this may be higher due to registration delays). This is the highest number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 in Wales.\nIt is important to note that the number of death occurrences is incomplete as it is likely that more deaths need to be registered, therefore comparisons should be treated with caution.\nIn particular, instances where the number of death occurrences on each day in January was below the range of the last five years, are likely to be a result of when the data extract was created. Specifically, deaths that occurred towards the end of the month may not have been registered by the time the data extract was created. We would therefore expect the number of death occurrences to be higher in future releases.\nIn this section we use the multiple health conditions that can be recorded on a death certificate to identify deaths where there were pre-existing health conditions that contributed to the cause of death. Health conditions are recorded on the death certificate only if the certifying doctor or coroner believed they made some contribution to the death, direct or indirect: the death certificate does not include all health conditions the deceased might have suffered from if they were not considered relevant. However, the fact that a pre-existing condition was recorded does not suggest that the deceased was likely to have died from that condition in the absence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.\u00a0\nOf the 73,519 non-neonatal deaths of residents registered in England and Wales in 2020 with an underlying cause of death of COVID-19, there were 22 cases where the ordering of health conditions on the death certificate was\u00a0ambiguous.\u00a0These 22 cases are excluded from the data presented in this section, leaving 73,497 deaths.\u00a0\nThe 20 most common pre-existing conditions for the 73,497 deaths registered in England and Wales with an underlying cause of death of COVID-19 in 2020 are shown in\u00a0Figure\u00a08 (Pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19, England and Wales dataset). In this table, pre-existing conditions are counted separately, so that a death where there was more than one pre-existing condition may appear under several different categories. We have also provided the frequency with which each condition was mentioned in all deaths registered in 2017 to 2019 (whatever the underlying cause of death) for comparison\u00a0in the Pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19, England and Wales dataset.\nThe most common pre-existing condition was dementia and Alzheimer's disease, identified in 25.3% of COVID-19 deaths. For comparison, dementia and Alzheimer's disease was mentioned in around a fifth of all-cause deaths in England and Wales between 2017 and 2019, a slightly lower proportion. \nThose conditions that are mentioned with a higher frequency in deaths due to COVID-19 than in all-cause deaths are of interest as they may indicate increased risk of dying from COVID-19 among people with those conditions. Of the 20 most common\u00a0pre-existing conditions, obesity, diabetes and hypertensive diseases were present in a notably greater proportion of COVID-19 deaths than in all-cause deaths\u00a0(Figure\u00a09).\nFor deaths occurring in people aged under 65 years, obesity, diabetes and hypertensive diseases were mentioned at over three times the rate in COVID-19 deaths than in all-cause\u00a0deaths.\u00a0The proportion of COVID-19 deaths in those aged under 65 years with a pre-existing condition of obesity was 7.6% compared with 2.0% of all-cause deaths between 2017 and 2019. A pre-existing condition of diabetes was mentioned on 27.3% of deaths due to COVID-19 compared with 7.8% of all-cause deaths between 2017 and 2019. The proportion of COVID-19 deaths in those aged under 65 years with a pre-existing condition of hypertensive diseases was 19.3% compared with 6.3% of all-cause deaths between 2017 and 2019. This means it is likely that these three conditions are risk factors for COVID-19 deaths.\nThe proportions of COVID-19 deaths with each of the 20 most common pre-existing conditions and all-cause deaths mentioning the same conditions are provided in\u00a0the Pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19, England and Wales dataset. The relative ratios of proportions of deaths with the condition is also presented (the \"COVID ratio\" is the proportion of COVID-19 deaths with the pre-existing condition divided by the proportion of all-cause deaths between 2017 and 2019 mentioning that condition; the \"all death ratio\" is the proportion of all-cause 2020 deaths mentioning the condition divided by the proportion of all-cause deaths between 2017 and 2019 mentioning that condition. Counts of deaths due to COVID-19 by the 20 most common pre-existing conditions and broad age group in England and in Wales (Pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19, England and Wales dataset). The mean number of pre-existing conditions for those aged under 65 years was 1.7 in England and 1.5 in Wales.\nThe mean number of pre-existing conditions for those aged 65 years and over was 2.0 in England and 1.8 in Wales. This pattern is broadly repeated each quarter. This means that the total number of pre-existing conditions mentioned for each COVID-19 death tended to be greater among deaths of those aged 65 years and over than among those aged under 65 years.\nThe 20 most common pre-existing conditions are analysed by place of death are available in the Pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19, England and Wales dataset. Dementia and Alzheimer's disease was a pre-existing condition in 53.5% of deaths due to COVID-19 that occurred in care homes. This proportion is somewhat higher than the proportion of all-cause deaths in care homes that mentioned dementia and Alzheimer's disease (47.8% of care home deaths between 2017 and 2019).\u00a0However, this is consistent with dementia and Alzheimer's disease being the most common pre-existing condition because of the distribution of COVID-19 deaths by age and place of death rather than dementia and Alzheimer's disease being a specific risk factor.\u00a0\nDiabetes and hypertensive diseases were the most common pre-existing\u00a0conditions for COVID-19 deaths occurring either in hospital or at home. Counts of deaths\u00a0due to COVID-19 having the 20 most common pre-existing conditions by place of death in England and in Wales are shown in the Pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19, England and Wales dataset. \n\nMonthly mortality analysis, England and Wales  Dataset | Released 25 February 2021  Monthly data on death registrations and death occurrences in England and Wales, broken down by sex and age.

There were 4,431 deaths registered in Wales, 25.6% more than the five-year average for January. The five years used for the average are from 2015 to 2019, to compare with the number of deaths expected in a usual (non-pandemic) year.\nAccounting for age, the COVID-19 death rate in England in January 2021 was 545.9 deaths per 100,000 people. The death rate increased between September 2020 and January 2021 but remained significantly lower than in April 2020. In Wales, the death rate in January 2021 due to COVID-19 was the highest rate so far, at 539.1 deaths per 100,000 people.\nCOVID-19 mortality rates in January were higher in more deprived areas of England and Wales. In England, the death rate due to COVID-19 in the most deprived areas was 710.4 deaths per 100,000 people, 1.8 times higher than in the least deprived areas (400.1 deaths per 100,000).\nIn Wales, the COVID-19 mortality rate in the most deprived areas (680.3 deaths per 100,000 people) was 1.5 times the mortality rate in the least deprived areas (444.7 deaths per 100,000 people).\nDiabetes, obesity and hypertension are likely to be risk factors for COVID-19 deaths. Analysis of death certificate data shows these conditions were mentioned at three times the rate in COVID-19 deaths than deaths from all causes in 2020.\nDementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease was the most common pre-existing condition for COVID-19 deaths, identified in 25.3% of all deaths due to COVID-19. This is likely due to age being a risk factor and that a large proportion of these deaths occurred care homes deaths.\n", "id": 356}, {"document": "In recent weeks, there is evidence that the percentage testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) has decreased in those in both patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles.\nThe number of socially distanced and physical contacts that adults and school-age children had with people outside their household decreased in January 2021, when England went into lockdown, and remains low in February.\nIn this article, we refer to the number of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households, and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings in England.\nThis article presents analysis on the characteristics of those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 - the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 disease in England.

The latest bulletin reports that the percentage testing positive decreased in the week ending 12 February 2021 (between 6 and 12 February).\nThis section provides the modelled estimates on positivity rates by patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles by age, with the two occupational groups split between those aged under 35 years and those 35 years and above. The modelling used is similar to that used to produce national trend modelling of COVID-19 infections in our weekly bulletin. More information about the methods used in the model is available in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThe models used to produce positivity rates for patient-facing and non-patient-facing roles include only swab test results from individuals aged 16 to 74 years. This analysis covers the time period between 1 September 2020 and 6 February 2021.\nIn recent weeks, the percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased in all groups: those who worked in both patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles, and those aged under 35 years and 35 years and above.\nThis contrasts with analysis in\u00a0our previous article published in January, where the percentage of the population testing positive had decreased in non-patient-facing job roles but increased among those in patient-facing roles, in the week ending 9 January 2021.\nDownload the data\nThis section looks at how often individuals are reporting social contact (either socially distanced or physical contact) with other people outside their own household. We asked individuals how many people aged 17 years and under, 18 to 69 years, and 70 years and over, outside their household, they have had contact with up to seven days prior to each visit. \"Contact\" refers to either of the following:\nsocially distanced contact - direct contact with social distancing only\nphysical contact - physical contact, such as a handshake or personal care, including wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\nThis analysis covers the time period between 27 July 2020 and 8 February 2021. We have produced estimates that have been weighted to be representative of the total population in England. Analysis includes all people taking part in the survey and is presented for school-age children (age 2 years to school Year 11) and adults (school Year 12 and above). We report the number of contacts in the following groups:\n0 (no reported contact)\n1 to 5 (reported contacts)\n6 to 10 (reported contacts)\n11 to 20 (reported contacts)\n21 or more (reported contacts)\nWe present the proportion of school-age children by each category of socially distanced contact in Figure 2. Our analysis suggests that from September 2020 onwards, there was an increase in \"21 or more\" socially distanced contacts with people aged 17 years and under, corresponding to school-age individuals returning to school and coming into contact with their peers. In early January 2021, socially distanced contacts decreased as schools were not fully opened in lockdown, continuing into February as schools remain not fully open.\nThere was a decrease in the number of socially distanced contacts with people aged 17 years and under in late October to early November and in late December 2020, corresponding to the half-term and Christmas breaks from school. In November, the proportion of socially distanced contacts returned to a similar number of contacts seen before half-term, but this did not happen in January 2021 and February as schools remained closed to the majority of pupils.\nThere is a similar pattern of increased socially distanced contacts with people aged 18 to 69 years from September 2020 onwards, which is likely to relate to the increased contact with teachers and parents. In early January 2021, the number of socially distanced contacts decreased as schools were not fully open.\nOver time, the number of socially distanced contacts with people who are over 70 years has decreased. There was some evidence of a slight rise in those reporting 1 to 5 contacts in late December, potentially because of some rules relaxing at Christmas.\nDownload the data\nAmong adults, the number of socially distanced contacts of all ages has decreased over time since September to October 2020. In December 2020, socially distanced contacts may have risen slightly as the November lockdown ended. The number of socially distanced contacts has decreased again in January 2021 and remains low in February, which could reflect the lockdown measures in place.\nDownload the data\nThe trends in physical contacts among school-age children are very similar to socially distanced contacts trends, although the number of physical contacts was lower. In January 2021, the proportion of physical contact across ages decreased as the country went into lockdown and schools were closed to the majority of pupils.\nTrends in physical contacts over time in adults are very similar to socially distanced contact trends, but there are more respondents that have had physical contact with zero individuals outside of their household. Across all ages of physical contacts, in adults the number of physical contacts has decreased over time from September and October 2020. Direct physical contacts decreased further when lockdown measures were introduced in January 2021.\nAdditional information on the proportions of physical contacts by school-age children and adults can be found in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nMore information on socially distanced and physical contact is also available in the\u00a0Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which examines the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) infections in the community in England  Dataset | Released 24 February 2021  Characteristics of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) in England taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.

This can be used to identify individuals who have had the infection in the past or have developed antibodies as a result of vaccination.\nIt takes between two and three weeks after infection or vaccination for the body to make enough antibodies to fight the infection. Antibodies remain in the blood at low levels, although these levels can decline over time to the point that tests can no longer detect them. Having antibodies can help to prevent individuals from getting the same infection again.\nWe measure the presence of antibodies to understand who has had the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the past and the impact of vaccinations. Once infected or vaccinated, the length of time antibodies remain at detectable levels in the blood is not fully known. It is also not yet known how having detectable antibodies, now or at some time in the past, affects the chance of getting COVID-19 again.\nWe have changed the way we report our antibody estimates and are now presenting weighted estimates for 28-day periods of antibody positivity for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, rather than monthly estimates. This approach will allow us to provide more frequent updates on antibody data.\nWe also present the weighted estimates of antibody positivity for regions of England, and broken down by age for each of the UK countries. For the first time we are also presenting estimates of antibody positivity by sex for each UK country, and by age and sex for England.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

The estimate is weighted to be representative of the overall population and suggests that an average of 10.5 million people aged 16 years and over in England would have tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 during this time (95% confidence interval: 10.2 million to 10.7 million). This equates to 1 in 4 people aged 16 years and over (95% confidence interval: 1 in 4 to 1 in 4). The estimates suggest there has been an increase in antibody positivity in England in the most recent 28-day period.\nIn Wales, an estimated 16.4% of the population would have tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample (95% confidence interval: 14.0% to 19.0%) in the 28 days up to 11 February 2021. It is estimated that an average of 416,000 people aged 16 years and over in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies during this time (95% confidence interval: 356,000 to 482,000). This equates to 1 in 6 people aged 16 years and over (95% confidence interval: 1 in 7 to 1 in 5).\nIn Northern Ireland, an estimated 15.9% of the population would have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample (95% confidence interval: 12.8% to 19.5%) in the 28 days up to 11 February 2021. It is estimated that an average of 236,000 people aged 16 years and over in Northern Ireland would have tested positive for antibodies during this time (95% confidence interval: 190,000 to 289,000). This equates to 1 in 6 people aged 16 years and over (95% confidence interval: 1 in 8 to 1 in 5).\nIn Scotland, an estimated 13.1% of the population would have tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample (95% confidence interval: 11.6% to 14.7%) in the 28 days up to 11 February 2021. It is estimated that an average of 586,000 people aged 16 years and over in Scotland would have tested positive for antibodies during this time (95% confidence interval: 520,000 to 658,000). This equates to 1 in 8 people aged 16 years and over (95% confidence interval: 1 in 9 to 1 in 7).\nWeighted estimates of the percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for 28-day periods in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are presented in Figure 1. \n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is low compared with England. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in estimates for these nations, as indicated by larger confidence intervals. \n\n\n\nEstimated percentage of people testing positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample, by 28-day periods, 8 May 2020 to 11 February 2021, UK\nDownload the data\nThe analysis in this section uses data taken from the 28 days up to 11 February 2021 to produce weighted antibodies estimates.\nThere was substantial variation in antibody positivity between regions, from 29.1% (95% confidence interval: 27.5% to 30.8%) in London compared with 16.3% (95% confidence interval: 14.7% to 18.0%) in the South West.\nConfidence intervals are large for some regions indicating high uncertainty in those estimates but there is still evidence of differences in the percentage of people testing positive for antibodies between regions.\nEstimated percentage of people testing positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample in the 28 days up to 11 February 2021, England\nDownload the data\nThe analysis in this section uses data taken from the 28 days up to 11 February 2021 to produce weighted antibody estimates by age in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nIn England, the highest percentage of people testing positive for antibodies was for those aged 80 years and over at 56.4% (95% confidence interval: 53.3% to 59.4%), most likely because of the high vaccination rate in this group.\u00a0This was followed by people aged 16 to 24 years, where the percentage testing positive for antibodies was 30.1% (95% confidence interval: 27.6% to 32.7%).\nThe lowest percentage of people testing positive for antibodies was for those aged 70 to 74 years at 16.6% (95% confidence interval: 15.1% to 18.1%). The percentage of people testing positive for antibodies for the other age groups ranged from 19.9% to 24.9%.\nWhile there were 56.4% of people aged 80 years and over testing positive for antibodies in England, this figure relates to the community population who live in private households. Therefore, people in this age group who live in establishments such as care homes are not included in this survey. Because this group was the priority for receiving vaccinations, the true figure among those aged 80 years and over in the population may be different. An\u00a0estimated\u00a090% of people aged 80 years and over live in private households\u00a0and 10% live in other establishments such as care homes.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people aged 80 years and over testing positive for antibodies was 18.5% (95% confidence interval: 8.7% to 32.5%). For those aged 16 to 24 years, 27.1% (95% confidence interval: 16.6% to 39.9%) tested positive for antibodies. The percentage of people testing positive for antibodies for the other age groups ranged from 8.3% to 17.8%.\nIn Northern Ireland, the percentage of people aged 70 years and over testing positive for antibodies was 17.6% (95% confidence interval: 10.8% to 26.4%). Because of small sample sizes, this analysis uses different age groups to England and other devolved administration antibodies analysis, with everyone over the age of 70 years included in the same age group. For those aged 25 to 34 years, 21.9% (95% confidence interval: 11.6% to 35.6%) tested positive for antibodies. The percentage of people testing positive for antibodies for the other age groups ranged from 9.4% to 16.4%.\nIn Scotland, 20.7% (95% confidence interval: 12.4% to 31.2%) of people aged 80 years and over tested positive for antibodies, most likely because of the high vaccination rate in this group. Between 5.6% and 16.7% of people in the other age groups tested positive for antibodies.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is low compared with England. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in estimates for these nations, as indicated by larger confidence intervals. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for antibodies in the oldest age groups varies considerably between nations. This could be explained by the varying approaches to vaccine distribution in different nations. This survey does not include those that live in care homes, one of the priority groups identified by the\u00a0Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\u00a0Daily and weekly counts of vaccine doses administered by nation can be seen in the\u00a0Public Heath England (PHE) dashboard.\nEstimated percentage of people testing positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample, by age, in the 28 days up to 11 February 2021, UK\nDownload the data\nThe analysis in this section presents modelled daily estimates of antibody positivity by single year of age for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

While the virus may have led to additional sickness absence, measures such as furloughing, social distancing, shielding and increased homeworking appear to have helped reduce other causes of absence, allowing the general downward trend to continue.\nA high number of people in employment were on furlough during 2020; this means they were temporarily away from employment that they expected to return to. Furloughed employments, as reported in HM Revenue and Customs's Coronavirus retention scheme statistics increased from the start of the scheme on 20 March to a peak of 8.9 million employments on 8 May 2020. The figures from 31 January 2020 show that the number of employments furloughed was 4.7 million.\nFurloughing has impacted some of the measures used in this analysis. Individuals may have been asked to \"shield\" during the pandemic; we cannot quantify how many of these are employed and able to work from home, how many were furloughed or how many are otherwise classified. This group of people would normally have a higher sickness absence rate than the not shielding group; if fewer from this group are in work then they will be contributing less to the number taking days off because of sickness or injury and could be one explanation for the reduction in the sickness absence rate in 2020.\nHomeworking became more prevalent in 2020, in April 2020, nearly half (47%) of people in employment did at least some of their work from home. This, together with government asking people to social distance and self-isolate may have led to less exposure to germs and minimise some of the usual sickness absences. Homeworking could also allow people to work when they were a little unwell, they might not have travelled to a workplace to work but feel well enough to work from home.\nThe total number of days lost because of sickness or injury and the number of days lost per worker both saw a significant fall in 2020. The data that feed into the total number of days lost and days lost per worker include furloughed workers; therefore, some of this fall will be because fewer people are in work to be taking days off because of sickness or injury. In addition, those employed but on furlough are included in the denominator for the number of days lost per worker but would not be contributing to the numerator.\nThe sickness absence rate, on the other hand, will not be affected by furloughed workers in the same way. This is derived as the total hours lost as a proportion of total hours worked. While there will be less hours lost and less hours worked, those contributing to both totals are consistent, therefore this measure should still be comparable over time. Since this measure is least impacted by the pandemic measures, it is therefore the most appropriate measure to use for sickness absence analysis to ensure comparability over time.\n\n!\n\nLabour Force Survey (LFS) responses are weighted to official population projections. As the current projections are 2018-based they are based on demographic trends that pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. We are analysing the population totals used in the weighting process and may make adjustments if appropriate. Rates published from the LFS remain robust; however, levels and changes in levels should be used with caution. This will particularly affect estimates for country of birth, nationality, ethnicity and disability.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows an overall fall in the sickness absence rate. From 2010 to 2018, there had been a relatively small change in the sickness absence rate. From 2018, the sickness absence rate continued to fall, reaching a record low since the data time series began in 1995. It fell to 1.8% in 2020, down from 3.1% in 1995. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) also reported 2020 as the lowest-ever average sickness absence rate in the 20-year history of their survey (PDF, 1.28MB).\nWhile the coronavirus (COVID-19) may have led to additional sickness absence, measures such as furloughing, social distancing, shielding, self-isolation and increased homeworking appear to have helped reduce other causes of absence, allowing the general downward trend to continue.\nLooking at the other measures of sickness absence, 118.6 million working days were lost because of sickness or injury in the UK in 2020, equating to 3.6 days lost per worker. These are the lowest levels since records began in 1995. Please note, these measures should be used with caution since they are affected by furloughed workers (see Section 2).\nThere are four main reasons for sickness absence in the UK; these have shown the highest percentage of occurrences over most of the decade. The 2020 figures are:\nminor illnesses (26.1%)\nother conditions (17.1%)\nmusculoskeletal problems (15.4%)\nmental health conditions (11.6%)\nMinor illness includes coughs, colds and flu; sickness, nausea and diarrhoea, and was the biggest single reason for sickness absence over the decade. However, we saw a fall of 4.3 percentage points between 2019 and 2020; this could be because of the restrictions of the pandemic and less social contact resulting in less transmission of germs.\nMusculoskeletal problems, which includes back pain, neck and upper limb problems and other musculoskeletal problems, were the second most common reason for sickness absence for most of the decade. However, in 2020, \"other\" problems have become the second most common reason for sickness absence. This includes accidents, poisonings, infectious diseases, skin disorders, diabetes and anything else not covered.\nThe \"Other\" category is the advised category for reporting coronavirus-related illnesses, which could be one reason for the increase. However, since the data are self-reported, coronavirus-related illnesses could also be reported elsewhere, such as under \"Respiratory conditions\" or \"Minor illnesses\". From April 2020, if a respondent answered any of these options, they were asked a follow-up question about whether this sickness absence was because of the coronavirus. Since April 2020, the coronavirus has accounted for 14.0% of all occurrences of sickness absence.\nSickness absence rates have fallen for both sexes and have been consistently lower for men than women. Women lost 2.3% of their working hours in 2020 as a result of sickness or injury, in comparison with 1.5% for men. Over the decade the sickness absence rate for women has been falling at a faster rate than men, 0.5 percentage points compared with 0.3 percentage points for men. \nThe sickness absence rate has fallen for all age groups between 16 to 64 years in the last decade. The only age group to see an increase over the decade was those aged 65 years and over, increasing by 0.4 percentage points to 2.8% in 2020. Sickness absence rates are higher among older workers than younger workers as they are more likely to develop health problems. One recent example of this is the coronavirus, where research shows that older people are more vulnerable to becoming seriously ill from contracting the virus.\nThe highest sickness absence rate in 2020 was seen in Wales, at 2.2%. This was 0.4 percentage points higher than the UK rate. London had the lowest sickness absence rate in 2020 at 1.4%, which was 0.4 percentage points lower than the UK rate.\nThese figures can be largely explained by the differing age profiles and occupations for workers in different parts of the UK.\nWorkers who report having a long-term health condition (that is, those that last 12 months or more) have a higher sickness absence rate than those who do not report having such a condition. The sickness absence rate for those with a long-term health condition was 3.9% in 2020, compared with 1.0% for those without such a condition.\nBoth workers with and without long-term health conditions have experienced a minor reduction in their sickness absence rates between 2010 and 2020. For workers with long-term health conditions, the rate has fallen by 0.5 percentage points, from 4.4% in 2010 to 3.9% in 2020. For workers without long-term health conditions, the rate has fallen by 0.4 percentage points, from 1.4% in 2010 to 1.0% in 2020.\nThe 2020 sickness absence rate may not show the true trend for those with long-term health conditions. Individuals with long-term health conditions may have been asked to \"shield\" during the pandemic; we cannot quantify how many of these are employed and able to work from home or how many are furloughed. This group of people normally have a higher sickness absence rate than the not shielding group. If fewer from this group are in work, then they will be contributing less to the number taking days off because of sickness or injury and could be one explanation for the reduction in the sickness absence rate in 2020. \nThe long-term health condition is not necessarily the reason for the sickness absence experienced.\nSickness absence rates for workers within the public and private sectors stood at 2.7% and 1.6% respectively in 2020. The sickness absence rate for public sector employees has been consistently higher than that for private sector employees. Both sectors have seen an overall decrease since 2010, although the sickness absence rate is falling at a faster rate for the public sector (0.4 percentage points) than the private sector (0.3 percentage points).\nWhen comparing the reasons given for sickness absence in the public and private sectors, mental health conditions are given as the reason more frequently in the public sector. They accounted for 15.0% of absences in the public sector and 9.9% in the private sector in 2020.\nThere are several factors to consider when examining the differences between the public and private sectors, including:\n\u00a0there are differences in the types of jobs between the sectors, and some jobs have higher likelihoods of sickness than other\nworkers in the private sector are more likely not to be paid sickness absence than those in the public sector\nthe analysis only counts someone as sick if they work fewer hours than they are contracted for and would exclude someone who makes up lost hours at a later point in the week; individuals in smaller workforces, which are more prominent in the private sector, may be under more pressure to make up any lost hours, but no data are collected on hours made up following sick absence\nIn terms of workforce size, workers in large organisations report higher rates of sickness than smaller organisations, those employing 50 to 499 or 500 and over people reported a sickness absence rate of 2.1% and 2.0% respectively, compared with a rate of 1.6% for workers in organisations that employ fewer than 25 people.\nWorkers in caring, leisure and other service occupations have the highest sickness absence rate in 2020, at 3.3%. In contrast, those working in managerial and senior roles (for example, chief executives and financial managers) have the lowest sickness absence rate, at 1.1% in 2020. This has been the case for most of the decade. Elementary occupations were the only occupation group that saw an increase in the sickness absence rate from 2010 to 2020. Occupational groups will have been affected differently by the pandemic, which might have an effect on their sickness absence rates, ability to work from home would be very different across these groups as can be seen in the article published in July on who can work at home.\nThe sickness absence rate for part-time workers has been consistently higher than the rate for full-time workers for the entire data time series. This can be explained in part by higher numbers of women working part-time, and occupations that have a higher proportion of part-time workers, as they also tend to have higher rates of sickness absence. Overall, the sickness absence rates of both part-time and full-time workers declined across the data time series. \nThere are several ways to estimate the number of key workers. For this analysis, we matched a combination of the\u00a02010 Standard Occupational Classifications\u00a0and\u00a02007 Standard Industrial Classifications\u00a0to the UK government definition. Individuals that fall within the category \"health and social care\" saw the biggest sickness absence rate in 2019 and 2020, this was 2.9% and 3.5% respectively.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Public safety and national security\" saw the largest rise in sickness absence, rising by 0.8 percentage points from 2019 to 2020. This was followed by the \"health and social care\" category, with a 0.5 percentage point rise from 2019 to 2020. These key worker categories include jobs that require public facing, therefore are at a higher risk of becoming sick. More information on the definitions of key workers can be seen in the Data sources and quality section.\nSome other key worker industries saw a reduction in sickness absence over the year, with \"national and local government\" down 0.7 percentage points and \"utilities and communication\" down 0.5 percentage points. This may be because of the ability to work from home through the pandemic in those industries. More detail on this can be seen in the article published in July on who can work at home. \n\nSickness absence in the UK labour market  Dataset | Released 3 March 2021  Annual sickness absence rates of workers in the UK labour market. \n\n\nThe estimates included in this release have been produced using the Labour Force Survey (LFS). They relate to people aged 16 years and over in employment and are for the whole of the UK. Estimates are available from 1995 onwards for most breakdowns. Estimates calculated using the LFS are based on annual averages across quarters for each calendar year: taking an average of the January to March, April to June, July to September and October to December datasets within a calendar year.\nThe total number of days lost is presented in millions, unless otherwise stated.\nThe sickness absence rate is presented as a percentage throughout these analyses.\nThe Labour Force Survey (LFS) Quality and Methodology Information (QMI) reports contain important information on:\nthe strengths and limitations of the data and how it compares with released data\nthe uses and users of the data\nhow the output was created\nthe quality of the output including the accuracy of the data\nMore information on the quality, methodology and history of the LFS can be found in the Labour Force Survey -- user guidance.\nEstimates of sickness absence at the UK level in 2020 were based on a sample size of approximately 700 averaged across the year. There is therefore a limit to how many breakdowns can be made of the data without significantly reducing quality or requiring an element of disclosure control.\nThe numbers quoted throughout this release are based on sample sizes of three or higher. Within the main tables, any estimate based on fewer than three people has been suppressed (denoted by an asterisk). In instances where secondary disclosure was present, the \"Prefers not to say\" category has also been suppressed. Any estimate based on a sample size of between 3 and 25 has been highlighted (with grey shading), to emphasise the potential quality limitation of the estimate. These have been applied as per Measuring and reporting reliability of Labour Force Survey and Annual Population Survey Estimates.\nBecause of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic a high number of people in employment were on furlough (away from work which they expect to return to) during 2020, which has impacted some of the measures of sickness absence; some of the falls seen in 2020 will be because there were fewer people in work, therefore fewer people taking days off because of sickness or injury.\nThere are several ways to estimate the number of key workers. For this analysis, we matched a combination of the\u00a02010 Standard Occupational Classifications\u00a0and\u00a02007 Standard Industrial Classifications\u00a0to theUK government definition. The occupation and industry groups in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) that were used as a basis for these estimates do not exactly match the occupation groups listed by the UK government. The UK government guidance is intentionally broad, and it is for employers to decide who is a key worker. Some workers under this definition may be furloughed; this is not captured in this definition. The article Coronavirus and key workers in the UK, published in May 2020 includes more details of this classification and other detailed analyses of this group.\nThe LFS design is based on interviewing households over five consecutive quarters. Generally, the first of these interviews, called Wave 1, takes place face-to-face, with most subsequent interviews, for Waves 2 to 5, conducted by telephone. During March 2020, we stopped conducting face-to-face interviews, instead switching to using telephone interviewing exclusively for all waves. This initially caused a significant drop in response. New measures have been introduced to improve this, which have increased sample sizes, although they are still below normal LFS sample sizes.\nLabour Force Survey (LFS) responses are weighted to official population projections. As the current projections are 2018-based they are based on demographic trends that pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. We are analysing the population totals used in the weighting process and may make adjustments if appropriate. Rates published from the LFS remain robust; however, levels and changes in levels should be used with caution. This will particularly affect estimates for country of birth, nationality, ethnicity and disability.\nBecause of the impact on data collection, different weeks throughout the quarter have different achieved sample sizes. To mitigate this impact on estimates the weighting methodology was enhanced to include weekly calibration to ensure that samples from each week had roughly equal representation within the overall three-month estimate. This meant that any impacts seen from changes in the labour market in those weeks would be fully represented within the estimates.\nBecause of the suspension of face-to-face interviewing in March 2020, we had to make operational changes to the LFS, particularly in the way that we contact households for initial interview, which moved to a \"by telephone\" approach. These changes have resulted in a response where certain characteristics have not been as well represented as previously. This is evidenced in a change in the balance of type of household that we are reaching. In particular, the proportion of households where people own their homes in the sample has increased and rented accommodation households has decreased.\nTo mitigate the impact of this non-response bias we have introduced housing tenure into the LFS weighting methodology for periods from January to March 2020 onwards. While not providing a perfect solution, this has redressed some of the issues that had previously been noted in the survey results.

The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest five.\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\nAs this is a household survey, our figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In these settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 in care homes can be found in\u00a0Impact of coronavirus in care homes in England: 26 May to 19 June 2020.\nOur headline estimate of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and the below outlines the appropriate uses of all of the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate and is used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way.\nInformation about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our\u00a0methods article.\nWe are continuously refining and looking to improve our modelling and presentations.

This causes variability between estimates over time, which is expected given the lower number of positive tests within each region, compared with England as a whole.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) for regions in England are available in our dataset and provide an alternative measure over time for context.\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates for the most recent week of data (between 21 February 2021 and up to 27 February 2021) at the sub-regional level.\n\n!\n\nThe analysis in this section presents modelled estimates at the sub-regional level for the UK. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was lower relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in these estimates; caution should be taken and the uncertainty of the estimates and wide credible intervals taken into account when interpreting or ranking them. As the percentage of people testing positive decreases and sample sizes become smaller, we may not be able to produce sub-regional estimates or may need to combine sub-regions in order to produce estimates. \n\n\n\nDownload the data\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether they are in school Year 6 or 7 (birthday before or after 1 September).\nSimilarly, 16- to 17-year-olds are split depending on whether they are in school Years 11 or 12 (birthday before or after 1 September).\u00a0\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in the different ages who tested positive for COVID-19 was lower relative to England overall.

We have estimated incidence by directly measuring when a participant in our study who has previously tested negative, subsequently tests positive, and comparing this with the number of participants who remain negative.\nWhen enrolled on the survey, participants are swabbed weekly for five weeks and then move to monthly swabbing. Increasing the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey sample size to 150,000 participants per fortnight enabled the majority of participants to be swabbed weekly, providing us with regular and timely updates on the number of new infections and the \"time at risk\". The proportion swabbed monthly has now increased and we have reviewed our estimation of incidence, determining options that will adapt our approach to reflect changes in data capture and survey design. We committed to regular reviews of our methods and survey design as part of our ongoing quality assurance process to ensure our estimates remain of the highest quality possible and continue to meet our user needs. This review ensures we will continue to provide an accurate estimate of incidence and to make sure our statistics continue to be of high quality. We will confirm a date for publication of our reviewed estimates nearer the time.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The new UK variant of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes that coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the new UK variant, the S-gene is no longer detected by the current test. When there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious) absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab and N-genes) is a reliable indicator of the new UK variant in COVID-19 . However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of the new UK variant.\nIn contrast, the South African and Brazilian variants have an S-gene that is detectable with the current test and will therefore be included in the \"not compatible with new UK variant\" group of COVID-19 where the virus level is high enough to identify this. Which of these types of COVID-19 are compatible with these variants cannot be identified from the swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test alone. You can\u00a0read more about the new UK variant\u00a0in our recent blog.\nSince 24 December 2020, we have reported on the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the new UK variant that was identified in mid-November. Because of the continued decrease in overall percentages testing positive for COVID-19 across the UK, we have removed the new variant charts from this week's publication. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the new UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying dataset.\nWe will continue to monitor the trends in different variants over the coming weeks and will reintroduce charts into the bulletin if there is a variant that appears to be affecting the trends in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19.\nThe percentage testing positive compatible with the new UK variant decreased in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the week ending 27 February 2021. In Scotland, the trend testing positive compatible with the new UK variant is uncertain.\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Section 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low, under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on\u00a0sensitivity and specificity in our methods article. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey  Dataset | Released 5 March 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest five.\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\nAs this is a household survey, our figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In these settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 in care homes can be found in\u00a0Impact of coronavirus in care homes in England: 26 May to 19 June 2020.\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and the below outlines the appropriate uses of all of the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate and is used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way.\nInformation about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our\u00a0methods article.\nWe are continuously refining and looking to improve our modelling and presentations.

This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive has decreased in the West Midlands, East of England, South West and London in the week ending 13 March 2021. The trend is uncertain for the rest of the regions, although, there may be early signs of an increase for the East Midlands. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nDownload the data\nThe percentage of people testing positive by region was calculated using a similar modelling approach to the national daily estimates in Section 2: Number of people in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who had COVID-19.\nThe analysis is conducted over a six-week period, which means specific positive cases move into and then out of the sample. This causes variability between estimates over time, which is expected given the lower number of positive tests within each region, compared with England as a whole.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) for regions in England are available in our dataset and provide an alternative measure over time for context.\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 8 November 2020 to 13 March 2021 for sub-regions in England and modelled estimates from 6 February to 13 March 2021 for sub-regions in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nAs the percentage of people testing positive decreases, sub-regional estimates are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the credible intervals. We will continue to monitor this over the coming weeks.\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in these estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nDownload the data\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether they are in school Year 6 or 7 (birthday before or after 1 September).\nSimilarly, 16- to 17-year-olds are split depending on whether they are in school Years 11 or 12 (birthday before or after 1 September).\u00a0\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in the different ages who tested positive for COVID-19 was lower relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in estimates for individual age groups over this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. The credible intervals can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive in England has decreased in those aged school Year 7 and older over the last two weeks, but the decline has slowed in all groups except those aged 25 to 34 years and 50 to 69 years. Trends in those aged 2 years to school Year 6 appear level, although there is high uncertainty. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trend.\nDownload the data\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these can be found in the dataset that accompanies this bulletin. This uses a different method to the grouped age analysis presented above for England and are therefore not comparable.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries; England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 31 January 2021. These estimates use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented above and is therefore not comparable.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in the different ages who tested positive for COVID-19 was lower relative to their respective national sample.

We have estimated incidence by directly measuring when a participant in our study who has previously tested negative, subsequently tests positive, and comparing this with the number of participants who remain negative.\nWhen enrolled on the survey, participants are swabbed weekly for five weeks and then move to monthly swabbing. Increasing the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey sample size to 150,000 participants per fortnight enabled the majority of participants to be swabbed weekly, providing us with regular and timely updates on the number of new infections and the \"time at risk\". The proportion swabbed monthly has now increased and we have reviewed our estimation of incidence, determining options that will adapt our approach to reflect changes in data capture and survey design. We committed to regular reviews of our methods and survey design as part of our ongoing quality assurance process to ensure our estimates remain of the highest quality possible and continue to meet our user needs. This review ensures we will continue to provide an accurate estimate of incidence and to make sure our statistics continue to be of high quality. We will confirm a date for publication of our reviewed estimates nearer the time.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The UK variant of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes which coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the UK variant, the S-gene is no longer detected by the current test. When there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious) absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab and N genes) is a reliable indicator of the UK variant in COVID-19. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S gene is a less reliable indicator of the UK variant.\nIn contrast, the South African and Brazilian variants have an S-gene that is detectable with the current test and will therefore be included in the \"not compatible with UK variant\" group of COVID-19 where the virus level is high enough to identify this. Which of these types of COVID-19 are compatible with these variants cannot be identified from the swab PCR test alone. You can\u00a0read more about the UK variant\u00a0in our recent blog.\nSince 24 December 2020, we have reported on the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant that was identified in mid-November. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying dataset.\nWe will continue to monitor the trends in different variants over the coming weeks and will reintroduce charts into the bulletin if there is a variant that we can identify using our test that appears to be affecting the trends in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19.\u00a0\nThe percentage testing positive compatible with the UK variant decreased in England in the week ending 13 March 2021. In Wales and Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage testing positive compatible with the UK variant is uncertain. There are early signs of an increase in the percentage testing positive compatible with the UK variant in Scotland.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. The number of cycles is measured as a \"Cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the dataset that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Section 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low, under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on\u00a0sensitivity and specificity in our methods article. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey Dataset | Released 19 March 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

The\u00a0study protocol\u00a0specifies the research for the study. Further information on what the analysis covers is provided at the start of each section.\nThe analysis in this article is based on blood test results taken from a randomly selected subsample of individuals aged 16 years and over, which are used to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This can be used to identify individuals who have had the infection in the past or have developed antibodies as a result of vaccination.\nIt takes between two and three weeks after infection or vaccination for the body to make enough antibodies to fight the infection. Antibodies remain in the blood at low levels, although these levels can decline over time to the point that tests can no longer detect them. Having antibodies can help to prevent individuals from getting the same infection again.\nWe measure the presence of antibodies to understand who has had the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the past and the impact of vaccinations. Once infected or vaccinated, the length of time antibodies remain at detectable levels in the blood is not fully known. It is also not yet known how having detectable antibodies, now or at some time in the past, affects the chance of getting COVID-19 again.\nWe present weighted estimates for 28-day periods of antibody positivity for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, which allows us to provide fortnightly updates on antibody data. The 28-day periods presented in this analysis are updated to work backwards from the most recent 28-day period available. This means the time periods overlap with those presented in previous articles.\nWe also present the weighted estimates of antibody positivity for regions of England, and broken down by age and by sex for each of the UK countries. In addition, we present estimates of antibody positivity by age and sex combined for England and for the first time for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

The percentage of people testing positive for antibodies is lower for those aged under 70 years, ranging from 27.4% to 32.0%.\nWhile there were 75.7% of people aged 80 years and over testing positive for antibodies in England, this figure relates to the community population who live in private households. Therefore, people in this age group who live in establishments such as care homes are not included in this survey. Because this group was the priority for receiving vaccinations, the true figure among those aged 80 years and over in the population may be different.

The percentage of people testing positive for antibodies was lower for those aged under 70 years, ranging from 20.0% to 27.4%.\nIn Northern Ireland, the percentage of people aged 70 years and over testing positive for antibodies was 44.4% (95% confidence interval: 34.7% to 54.3%). Because of small sample sizes, this analysis uses different age groups to England and other devolved administration antibodies analysis, with everyone over the age of 70 years included in the same age group. The percentage of people aged 25 to 34 years testing positive for antibodies was 22.9% (95% confidence interval: 13.7% to 34.5%).\nIn Scotland, the highest percentages of people testing positive for antibodies were for those aged 80 years and over at 60.9% (95% confidence interval: 50.3% to 70.8%), followed by people aged 75 to 79 years (39.8%, 95% confidence interval: 31.7% to 48.2%) and aged 70 to 74 years (38.9%, 95% confidence interval: 33.1% to 44.9%). The percentage of people testing positive for antibodies is lower in those aged under 70 years, ranging from 14.8% to 21.1%.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is low compared with England. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in estimates for these nations, as indicated by larger confidence intervals. \n\n\n\nThe higher levels of antibodies observed in older age groups reflect the high vaccination rate in older people. However, the percentage of people testing positive for antibodies varies by age group between nations. This could be explained by the varying approaches to vaccine distribution in different nations. This survey does not include those that live in care homes, one of the priority groups identified by the\u00a0Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\u00a0Daily and weekly counts of vaccine doses administered by nation can be seen in the\u00a0Public Heath England (PHE) dashboard.\nEstimated percentage of people testing positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample, by age, in the 28 days up to 3 March 2021, UK\nDownload the data\nThe analysis in this section presents modelled daily estimates of antibody positivity by single year of age for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

Differences between males and females in Northern Ireland were less certain because of wide confidence intervals. Possible reasons for these differences are that there are more females in occupation groups prioritised for vaccine, more females work in roles that may have exposed them to previous infection (such as personal caring services) or a biological reason (other research on immune responses and sex found that antibody responses to seasonal influenza vaccines are consistently at least twice as strong in females than males).\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is low compared with England.

In Northern Ireland, the estimate is 463,000 people, also around 1 in 3 (31.2%). In Scotland, an estimated 996,000 people, around 1 in 4 (22.3%) of the population would have tested positive for antibodies.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for antibodies was higher for females than males in England, Wales and Scotland.

Overall, all main sectors of GDP remained notably below their pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels and all were lower than in October 2020.\nThe services sector acted as the main drag on growth in January, decreasing by 3.5% as restrictions on activity were reintroduced in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The services sector was 10.2% below the level of February 2020 compared with 4.9% below the level seen in October 2020.\nThe production sector fell by 1.5% in January 2021 following eight months of consecutive growth. The sector was 5.0% below its February 2020 level. \nThe construction sector saw positive growth of 0.9% in January, after a decline of 2.9% in December 2020. The construction sector was 2.6% below the level of February 2020.\nThe service sector saw falls in 9 of the 14 sub-sectors between December 2020 and January 2021. The largest contributor to the fall was wholesale and retail trade, followed by education services, accommodation and food service activities, and other service activities such as hairdressing, because of the reintroduction of restrictions across the UK. There was growth in five sub-sectors, most notably in health activities, and information and communication services. Within the production sector, manufacturing contracted by 2.3% in January, the first decline in this sub-sector since April 2020.\nLooking ahead, initial results from Wave 25 of the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) found that the percentage of currently trading businesses experiencing a decrease in turnover in mid-February 2021, compared with normal expectations for this time of year, has fallen by 2 percentage points since early February (Wave 24), to 44%. This was last lower in mid-December 2020 (Wave 21) when it was 42%.\nThe monthly growth rate for GDP is volatile. It should therefore be used with caution and alongside other measures, such as the three-month growth rate, when looking for an indicator of the medium-term trend of the economy. However, it is useful in highlighting one-off changes that can be masked by three-month growth rates.\nGDP contracted by 1.7% in the three months to January 2021, down from a 1.0% growth in the three months to December 2020. \u2003\nFigure 4 shows the performance of total services output, a composite industrial indicator based on output in consumer-facing services, and output in all other industries in the services sector. In January 2021, consumer-facing services such as trade of motor vehicles and retail trade as well as food and beverage services weakened as restrictions were reintroduced across the UK. Unlike the impact of restrictions imposed in November, education services were also affected by the January restrictions. The education sector contracted by 16.3% in January 2021; the second largest contributor to the monthly decline. While remote learning activities are included for the education sector, the estimated output from these is lower than pre-pandemic classroom-based learning, as described in our School\u2019s Out: measuring education output in the summer of the pandemic blog post. \n\n!\n\nDifferences in the methods for estimating the output of health and education services across different countries mean GDP may be less internationally comparable during the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery than usual, so should be made with increased caution. \n\n\n\nHealth had a large contribution to growth in January 2021, increasing by 8.7%, mainly through coronavirus testing and tracing and vaccine schemes across the UK. Adjustments for these programmes increased overall GDP by 0.9 percentage points in January 2021; some of these adjustments are in other industries than health. More information is available in Section 8: Measuring the data.\nServices output contracted by 2.4% in the three months to January 2021. This was driven by decreases in consumer-facing industries, most notably accommodation and food service activities and wholesale and retail trade, which combined contributed negative 1.91 percentage points to headline GDP.\nProduction declined by 1.5% in January 2021 with contractions in two out of the four sub-sectors. The manufacturing sub-sector contracted by 2.3%, the first decline since April 2020, largely driven by a fall in exports. 9 out of the 13 manufacturing sub-sectors declined; the largest negative contribution came from the manufacture of transport equipment sector which contracted by 11.1%. This was driven by a decrease in the manufacture of motor vehicles industry of 16.9%.\nMining and quarrying continued to decline, decreasing by 0.7% in January 2021. Oil and gas extraction has seen large declines since June 2020, mainly due to tightened restrictions impacting on demand. Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply increased by 0.9%, while water supply increased 1.2% in January 2021. \nOutput in the production sector grew by 0.7% in the three months to January 2021. This was driven by increases in two out of the four sub-sectors, most notably in manufacturing following growth in both November and December 2020. \nConstruction output grew by 0.9% in January 2021 following a fall of 2.9% in December 2020. The monthly growth was driven by a rise in new work of 1.7% offset by a small contraction in repair and maintenance of 0.4%.\nThe growth in new work was driven by private commercial and infrastructure which grew by 4.5% and 3.1% respectively.\nDespite recovering to its pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels in the November 2020 release, at January 2021 the construction sector was 2.6% below February 2020.\nThe construction sector grew by 1.7% in the three months to January 2021.

The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest five.\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\nAs this is a household survey, our figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In these settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 in care homes can be found in\u00a0Impact of coronavirus in care homes in England: 26 May to 19 June 2020.\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all of the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate and is used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.

During the week ending 20 March 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive is observed in Yorkshire and The Humber.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 20 March 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the North West, and there were possible signs of an increase in Yorkshire and The Humber. In the same week, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the South East and the East of England. The percentage of people testing positive declined more slowly in London, the West Midlands, and the South West over the two weeks up to 20 March 2021. The trend was uncertain for the East Midlands and the North East. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nDownload the data\nThe percentage of people testing positive by region was calculated using a similar modelling approach to the national daily estimates in\u00a0Section 2: Number of people in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who had COVID-19.\nThe analysis is conducted over a six-week period, which means specific positive cases move into and then out of the sample. This causes variability between estimates over time, which is expected given the lower number of positive tests within each region, compared with England as a whole.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) for regions in England are available in our\u00a0dataset\u00a0and provide an alternative measure over time for context.\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 8 November 2020 to 20 March 2021 for sub-regions in England and modelled estimates from 6 February to 20 March 2021 for sub-regions in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nAs the percentage of people testing positive decreases, sub-regional estimates are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the credible intervals. We will continue to monitor this over the coming weeks.\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in these estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nDownload the data\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age 2 years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether they are in school Year 6 or 7 (birthday before or after 1 September).\nSimilarly, 16- to 17-year-olds are split depending on whether they are in school Years 11 or 12 (birthday before or after 1 September).\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in the different ages who tested positive for COVID-19 was lower relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in estimates for individual age groups over this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. The credible intervals can be found in the\u00a0dataset that accompanies this bulletin. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive in England increased in those in school Years 7 to 11 in the week ending 20 March 2021. In the same week, the percentage of people testing positive continued to decrease in those in school Years 12 to age 34 years and in those aged 50 to 69 years. Trends are uncertain in all other age groups. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trend.\nDownload the data\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model, these can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. This uses a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously for England and are therefore not comparable.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0dataset, and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nAn interactive chart showing the percentage testing positive by single year of age over time for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is published fortnightly and will be included in our next bulletin. \nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is produced by their respective statistical agencies, analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh.\nThis week we are re-introducing estimates of incidence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases using a new method based on our positivity estimate. This gives the rate at which new positives occur, and subsequently become detectable, within the population. Our incidence estimates for 13 July to 28 November 2020 considered new infections identified by new positive tests during the study compared with the number of days participants were \"at risk\". This new method accounts for the increasing proportion of survey participants providing monthly (rather than weekly) swabs.\nThe new incidence method uses an estimate of the length of time for which an individual will test positive, based on modelling the time from first positive to first subsequent negative test in the survey. This estimate is used alongside the positivity model to produce an estimate. This method is robust to participants having monthly swabs. For more information on the new method of incidence please see our updated methods article.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 10 days prior to the end of the positivity reference week. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data.\nEstimates are included for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nIn England, during the week ending 13 March 2021, we estimate that there were 2.00 new PCR-positive coronavirus (COVID-19) cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 1.47 to 2.45). This equates to 10,900 new positive cases in England per day (95% credible interval: 8,000 to 13,300). Incidence appears to have been relatively level in recent weeks in England.\nFor the first time we are able to present estimates of incidence for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Credible intervals are wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results. In particular, when prevalence is very low it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In this scenario we will still provide the upper bound of the credible interval.\nIn Wales, during the week ending 13 March 2021, we estimate that there were 1.29 new PCR-positive coronavirus cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.05 to 2.70). This equates to 390 new positive cases in Wales per day (95% credible interval: 20 to 820). Incidence appears to have been level in recent weeks in Wales, although credible intervals are wide because of the smaller sample size.\nIn Northern Ireland, during the week ending 13 March 2021, we estimate that there were 2.36 new PCR-positive coronavirus cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.61 to 4.76). This equates to 430 new positive cases in Northern Ireland per day (95% credible interval: 110 to 870). Incidence appears to have been level in recent weeks in Northern Ireland, although credible intervals are wide because of the smaller sample size.\nIn Scotland, during the week ending 13 March 2021, we estimate that there were 4.13 new PCR-positive coronavirus cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 2.58 to 5.87). This equates to 2,200 new positive cases in Scotland per day (95% credible interval: 1,400 to 3,100). Incidence increased in the week ending 13 March 2021 in Scotland, although credible intervals are wide.\nFigure 5 presents the official incidence estimates for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland for the week ending 13 March 2021. Modelled estimates for the most recent five weeks are also provided for each of the four countries.\nFor England, estimates between 28 November 2020 and the latest estimate have also been provided as indicative estimates. For Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland indicative estimates are provided back to 25 October 2020. These indicative estimates are based on our new model and are presented on the official estimates chart. Figure 5 also shows previously published official estimates of incidence for England using our old model.\nDownload the data\nThe incidence rate measures the occurrence of new PCR-positive cases of COVID-19, and the calculation of this is defined in Section 10: Glossary. The incidence rate is not the same as the reproduction rate (R), which is the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected person.\nTo calculate the estimated average number of people becoming PCR-positive per day, we multiply the daily incidence rate by the community population (see Coverage in Section 11: Measuring the data). We use the unrounded incidence rate to do this, so results will differ if calculated using the rounded estimates from the dataset.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The UK variant of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes which coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the UK variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. When there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious) absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab and N genes) is a reliable indicator of the UK variant in COVID-19. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of the UK variant.\nIn contrast, the South African and Brazilian variants have an S-gene that is detectable with the current test and will therefore be included in the \"not compatible with UK variant\" group of COVID-19 where the virus level is high enough to identify this. Which of these types of COVID-19 are compatible with these variants cannot be identified from the swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test alone. You can\u00a0read more about the UK variant\u00a0in our recent blog.\nSince 24 December 2020, we have reported on the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant that was identified in mid-November. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nWe will continue to monitor the trends in different variants over the coming weeks and will reintroduce charts into the bulletin if there is a variant that we can identify using our test that appears to be affecting the trends in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19.\u00a0\nThe percentage testing positive compatible with the UK variant has likely levelled off in England in the week ending 20 March 2021. In Wales and Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage testing positive compatible with the UK variant is uncertain. The percentage testing positive compatible with the UK variant has likely increased in Scotland in the week ending 20 March 2021.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. The number of cycles is measured as a \"Cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low, under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on\u00a0sensitivity and specificity in our methods article. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey  Dataset | Released 26 March 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

We estimate that 162,500 people, equivalent to 0.30% of the community population or 1 in 340 people, would have tested positive for COVID-19 in the most recent week. This is similar to the 160,200 people (0.29%) estimated in the week ending 13 March 2021.\nThe community population are people not in hospitals, care homes or institutional settings.\nIn Wales, the overall percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 also appeared level in the week ending 20 March 2021. An estimated 6,700 people (0.22% or 1 in 450 people) had COVID-19 in the most recent week, compared with 7,000 people (0.23%) the week before.\nIn Northern Ireland, an estimated 5,800 people (0.32% or 1 in 320 people) of the community population had COVID-19 in the week ending 20 March 2021. This is the same as the week before, though these results have a high uncertainty.\nIn Scotland, our modelling suggests the percentage testing positive has increased over the two weeks up to 20 March 2021. It is estimated that 21,500 people (0.41% or 1 in 240 people) had COVID-19 in the most recent week, an increase from 19,300 people (0.37%) in the week ending 13 March 2021 and 16,600 people (0.31%) the week before that.\n", "id": 381}, {"document": "In recent weeks, there is evidence that the percentage testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) has continued to decrease for those in both patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles.\nThe number of socially distanced and physical contacts that adults and school-age children reported with people outside their household decreased at the start of the year and remained low in early March 2021.\nDisabled people who were limited a lot in their daily activities were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than non-disabled people.\nIn this article, we refer to the number of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households, and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings in England.\nThis article presents analysis on the characteristics of those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 disease in England.

This week we have improved the methods used to produce this analysis and more information is available in our accompanying dataset.\nThe models used to produce positivity rates for patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles include only swab test results from individuals aged 16 to 74 years. This analysis covers the time period between 3 September 2020 and 8 March 2021.\nIn recent weeks, the percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to decrease in all groups: those who worked in both patient-facing and non-patient-facing job roles, and those aged under 35 years and 35 years and over.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 on nose and throat swabs by patient-facing role and age, England, from 3 September 2020 to 8 March 2021\nThis section looks at how often individuals are reporting social contact (either socially distanced or physical contact) with other people outside their own household. We asked individuals how many people aged 17 years and under, 18 to 69 years, and 70 years and over, outside their household, they have had contact with up to seven days prior to each visit. \u201cContact\u201d refers to either of the following:\nsocially distanced contact \u2013 direct contact with social distancing only\nphysical contact \u2013 physical contact, such as a handshake or personal care, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)\nThis analysis covers the time period between 11 August 2020 and 8 March 2021. In England, schools fully opened on 8 March, so this analysis does not include the period following the re-opening of schools. We have produced estimates that have been weighted to be representative of the total population in England. Analysis includes all people taking part in the survey, and is presented for school-age children (age 2 years to school Year 11) and adults (school Year 12 and above). We report the number of contacts in the following groups:\n0 (no reported contact)\n1 to 5 (reported contacts)\n6 to 10 (reported contacts)\n11 to 20 (reported contacts)\n21 or more (reported contacts)\nWe present the proportion of school-age children reporting each category of socially distanced contact in Figure 2. Among school-age children, the number of socially distanced contacts reported with all age groups decreased at the start of the year and has remained low through to the first week of March 2021, compared with December 2020. There is a consistent trend over time, with school-age children reporting more socially distanced contacts with those aged under 18 years than with people aged 18 to 69 years or those aged 70 years and over. \nProportion of school age children by number of socially distanced contacts with different age groups, England, from 11 August 2020 to 8 March 2021\nAmong adults, the number of socially distanced contacts reported with all age groups decreased in early January 2021 and has remained low through to the first week of March 2021, compared with December 2020. Adults reported more socially distanced contacts with those aged 18 to 69 years than with people under the age of 18 years or 70 years and over.\nProportion of adults by number of socially distanced contacts with different age groups, England, from 11 August 2020 to 8 March 2021\nAmong school-age children, the trends in physical contacts are very similar to socially distanced contacts trends, although the number of physical contacts was lower. The number of physical contacts school-age children reported with those aged under 70 years decreased in early January 2021 and has remained low through to the first week of March 2021, compared with December 2020. There is a consistent trend over time, with school-age children reporting to have more physical contacts with those aged under 18 years than with those aged 18 to 69 years or 70 years and over.\nAmong adults, trends in physical contacts over time are very similar to socially distanced contact trends, but there are more respondents who have reported physical contact with nobody outside of their household. The number of physical contacts adults reported with those under the age of 70 years decreased in early January 2021 and has remained low through to the first week of March 2021, compared with December 2020. Adults reported more physical contacts with those aged 18 to 69 years than with people under the age of 18 years and those 70 years and over.\nAdditional information on the proportions of physical contacts by school-age children and adults can be found in the accompanying dataset.\nMore information on socially-distanced and physical contact is also available in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which examines the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain.\nThis section covers the likelihood of individuals testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) from nose and throat swabs in England, from 1 September 2020 to 28 February 2021 by self-reported disability status.\nIn this article, a person is considered disabled if they have a self-reported long-standing illness, condition or impairment, which causes difficulty with day-to-day activities. This definition is consistent with the Equality Act 2010 and the Government Statistical Service (GSS) harmonised definition.\nIn this analysis, the reference group, those who are referred to as non-disabled, is made up of individuals who either responded \u201cno\u201d to having a long-term health condition or who responded \u201cyes\u201d but reported the long-term health condition did not reduce their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. The group referred to as \u201cdisabled people \u2013 limited a little\u201d is made up of individuals who answered \u201cyes\u201d to having a long-term health condition and reported that their condition reduced their ability to carry out their day-to-day activities a little, while the group referred to as \u201cdisabled people \u2013 limited a lot\u201d also answered \u201cyes\u201d and reported that their condition reduced their ability to carry out their day-to-day activities a lot. The distinction between limited a little and limited a lot is based solely on data from the survey and not inferred from any other information. Therefore, it only implies a difference based on self-reported activity restriction.\nFor more information on the questions used in our analysis, please see our latest participant questionnaire.\nThis analysis is based on data from participants aged 18 to 80 years in England, from 1 September 2020 to 28 February 2021 and is presented by self-reported disability.\nWhere participants self-reported that their long-term health condition had a different level of impact on their daily activities at different dates during the study period, the highest level of restrictions on activity was taken\u00b9. For example, if a respondent reported that their health condition had a little impact on their day-to-day life at one point in the study and a lot of impact at another, they would be placed in the category of \u201cdisabled people \u2013 limited a lot\u201d.\nLikelihood of testing positive is based on a statistical model accounting for calendar time, age (varying effect over calendar time), sex, ethnicity, household size, multigenerational household, Index of Multiple Deprivation rank\u00b2, region, and urban or rural status. It is important to note that English regions were modelled separately, allowing the effect of age to vary over calendar time, to reflect changes in infection levels across regions and age groups over the period studied. Estimates were then combined to produce an average estimate by disability status across England overall.\nThis analysis considers the likelihoods of testing positive for disabled people who are limited a little or a lot, compared with those who are not disabled.\nResults are presented as odds ratios. When a characteristic (for example, being male) has an odds ratio of one, this means that there is neither an increase nor a decrease in the likelihood of infection compared with a reference category (for example, being female). \nAn odds ratio of higher than one means that there is an increased likelihood of infection compared with the reference category. \nAn odds ratio of lower than one means that there is a reduced likelihood of infection compared with the reference category. \nFor the purpose of this analysis, the model will show the likelihood of individuals in the \u201cdisabled people \u2013 limited a little\u201d group and \u201cdisabled people \u2013 limited a lot\u201d group testing positive for COVID-19 compared with individuals in the \u201cnon-disabled people\u201d group (the reference category).\nThe odds ratios are presented with 95% confidence intervals. If the range of the confidence interval crosses the threshold of one, we cannot say with any certainty whether infection is more or less likely for that characteristic compared with the reference category, even if the estimate is not close to one. In some instances, this will be because we estimate there to be no differences (where the odds ratio estimate is close to one), but it can also reflect less information about a characteristic in our sample.\nFrom 1 September 2020 to 28 February 2021, disabled people who are limited a lot were significantly less likely to test positive for COVID-19 compared with non-disabled people. However, the estimated reduction in risk of testing positive was small, at 12% less likely (odds ratio: 0.88; 95% confidence intervals: 0.78 to 0.98).\nThere is no evidence of a difference in the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 between disabled people who are limited a little and non-disabled people (odds ratio: 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0:90 to 1:07).\nA possible explanation for disabled people who are limited a lot being less likely to test positive for COVID-19 could be that these individuals engage in more protective behaviours, such as shielding.\nThere was some limited evidence of regional variation, but overall, the differences were small. The data for the regional models is in our accompanying dataset.\nThe odds ratios of disabled people \u2013 limited a little and limited a lot testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on a swab test compared with individuals from the non-disabled group, England, between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2021\nThis analysis is based on weighted data from participants aged 18 to 80 years who responded to the survey between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2021 in England and looks at how often individuals are reporting contact with other people outside their own household by self -reported disability status. We classify contact and report the number of contacts in the same way as the analysis reported in Section 4. \nOur analysis suggests since September 2020, the number of socially distanced contacts reported with people across all ages has decreased among both disabled and non-disabled people.\nHowever, since September 2020, non-disabled and disabled people who are limited a little have reported more socially distanced contacts than disabled people who are limited a lot.\nThere is limited evidence of a difference in the number of physical contacts reported between non-disabled and disabled people. Non-disabled people may have been more likely to have physical contacts with larger numbers of people, in particular prior to Christmas 2020.\nThe number of physical contacts has decreased over time from September and October 2020, among both disabled people who are limited a little and limited a lot.\nThe data for social and physical contact by disability status is presented in the accompanying dataset.\nProportion of socially distanced contacts with those aged 18 to 69 years by self-reported disability status, England, from 1 September 2020 to 28 February 2021\nThis difference in the number of reported socially distanced and physical contacts between non-disabled people and disabled people who are limited a little in comparison with disabled people who are limited a lot could be because of protective behaviours, such as social distancing and shielding undertaken during the pandemic. In addition, those who are limited a lot may be less able to see people than those in both other groups analysed because of greater limits on their mobility.\nIn July 2020, Coronavirus and the social impacts on disabled people reported around 1 in 10 disabled people (9%) reported feeling very unsafe when outside their home because of the coronavirus pandemic, compared with fewer than 1 in 25 non-disabled people (3%). Similarly, disabled people were less likely to report leaving their homes, for exercise, to meet up with people in a personal place, to eat or a drink at a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bar or pub, to travel to work or to take children to and from school. These issues with feelings of safety and the impact on mobility for disabled people, particularly for those who are impacted a lot, could also help to explain the trends in positivity seen previously.\nAnalysis from February 2021 provides estimates of differences in COVID-19 mortality risk by self-reported disability status and diagnosed learning disability status for deaths occurring up to 20 November 2020, using linked data from the 2011 Census, death registrations, and primary care and hospital records. Analysis such as this around the increased rates of mortality from COVID-19 among disabled people demonstrate the risks of contracting COVID-19 for disabled people, even if the likelihood of disabled people contracting COVID-19 is the same for those limited a little or slightly lower for those limited a lot.\nFor further data on home-leaving behaviour and socialising among disabled people, please see datasets from March 2020 to February 2021. These data were not collected from the same cohort of respondents and were looking at different time periods to the ones shown previously so all connections between these results and this analysis should be interpreted with caution.\nThese data from 2020, look at pre-pandemic rates of loneliness among disabled people between the year ending April 2014 and the year ending March 2019. In March 2019, 13.9% of disabled people reported feelings of loneliness often or always compared with 3.8% of non-disabled people.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) infections in the community in England Dataset | Released 25 March 2021 Characteristics of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) in England taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.

This could be because they have engaged in more protective behaviours such as shielding.\nAnalysis also examined how often individuals were reporting social contact (either socially distanced or physical contact) with other people outside their own household. It found that the amount of socially distanced contact between school-age children and all other age groups decreased at the start of the year and has remained low through to the first week of March 2021, compared with December 2020.\nThere is a consistent trend over time with school-age children reporting more socially distanced contact with those aged under 18 years than with people aged 18 to 69 years or those aged 70 years and over .\nAmong adults, the amount of socially distanced contact reported with all age groups decreased in early January 2021 and has remained low through to the first week of March, compared with December 2020.

This suggests affordability slightly worsened in Wales.\nIt is important to note that the changes in affordability in both England and Wales were not statistically significant when compared with the previous year.\nIt is not possible to use these data to examine the effect COVID-19 has had on housing affordability as the latest earnings data available used in this period are as at April 2020.\nAt the local level, earnings increased by more than house prices in nearly 60% of local authority districts in England and Wales, leading to improvements in housing affordability in these areas. However, these were not statistically significant changes on the previous year.\nFigure 2 is an interactive map that shows the median housing affordability ratios over time, for each local authority in England and Wales.\nHousing affordability ratio by local authority district, England and Wales, 1997 to 2020\nDownload the data\nAlthough housing affordability improved in nearly 60% of local authorities between 2019 and 2020, looking at longer term trends can help identify significant changes in affordability.\nFigure 2 shows that since 1997 housing affordability has worsened overall. Over the last two decades, affordability has worsened the most in London, which is driven largely by increasing house prices. In 2020, 8 of the 10 least affordable local authorities in England and Wales were in London, with the other two being in the surrounding South East region. The most affordable local authorities in 2020 were in the North West, Wales, East Midlands and Yorkshire and The Humber.\nRange of median housing affordability ratio in local authorities for English regions and Wales, England and Wales, 2020\nDownload the data\nFigure 3 enables us to compare the affordability ratios between regions and for Wales. It also enables us to look at the variation within an area as the length of bar presents the range between the highest and lowest local authority. This means that we can compare the local authorities within and across larger areas.\nFigure 3 shows a large degree of overlap in the affordability of local authorities between most English regions and Wales, indicating similar affordability. In 2020, full-time employees in 290 local authorities (86.6%) could expect to spend between 5 and 15 times their annual earnings on buying a property.\nThe range in estimated housing affordability across London was 27, down from 29 in 2019. This gap is large mainly because of the large affordability ratio in Kensington and Chelsea. The next highest region was the South East, with a range of 10.7. In 2019, the South West had the second largest range, but dropped from 10.5 in 2019 to 8.1 in 2020. Generally, the most affordable regions have the least variability of local authorities' ratios.\nCopeland, in the North West, remained the most affordable local authority in England and Wales in 2020. In Copeland, the average price paid for properties was estimated to be 2.6 times average annual earnings. This is a slight decrease from 2019 but is not statistically significant.\nKensington and Chelsea, in London, remained the least affordable local authority in England and Wales, with average house prices estimated at 36.4 times average annual earnings. This is a decrease from 2019 when house prices were 39.3 times annual earnings in Kensington and Chelsea, although it was not a significant change.\nThe difference in the housing affordability ratio estimates between the most and least affordable local authorities in England and Wales was 33.8 in 2020. This is a decrease from 36.6 in 2019. This year was the second year running that the gap between the most and least affordable local authorities closed since the series peak in 2018.\nNottingham was the only local authority in England and Wales that had a statistically significant change in the ratio of median house prices to median workplace-based annual earnings over five years between 2015 and 2020. In Nottingham, affordability significantly worsened, going from 4.33 in 2015 to 5.16 in 2020. There were no other local authorities that had a statistically significant improvement or decline in affordability over the last five years.\nIn 2020, full-time employees in England could expect to spend 9.6 times their median gross annual earnings on purchasing a newly built property, and 7.6 times their annual earnings on an existing property.\nIn Wales, full-time employees on average spent 8.2 times their median gross annual earnings on a newly built property, and 5.7 times their earnings for an existing property.\nIn Wales, the ratio of house prices to earnings in 2020 was 44% higher for new dwellings than for existing dwellings. This is a slight decrease from 2019 but higher than the previous 13 years.\nIn England, the ratio of house prices to earnings in 2020 was 27% higher for new dwellings than for existing dwellings, having remained at a similar level since 2017.\nIn the English regions, the North East had the largest difference in affordability between new and existing dwellings. In that region, the ratio of house prices to earnings for new dwellings was 67% greater than the ratio for existing dwellings.\nThe regions that had the smallest difference between the housing affordability ratios for new and existing dwellings were London, the South East, South West and East of England. In all these areas, the difference between affordability ratios for new and existing dwellings was less than 20%.\n\nHouse price to residence-based earnings ratio Dataset | Released 25 March 2021 Affordability ratios calculated by dividing house prices by gross annual residence-based earnings.

This has been driven by an increase in house prices.\nThe most affordable local authorities in 2020 were in the North West, Wales, East Midlands and Yorkshire and The Humber.\nThe gap between the most and least affordable local authorities continued to decrease in 2020.\nAt the local level, earnings increased by more than house prices in nearly 60% of local authority districts in England and Wales, leading to improvements in housing affordability in these areas. However, these were not statistically significant changes on the previous year.\nWhile these data show early evidence of change, they are not considered to be statistically significant.

The vaccination rate was slightly higher for females (90.4 %) than males (90.0%).\nVaccination rates were higher for those aged 75 to 89 years than those aged 90 years and over; 92.6% of adults aged 80 to 84 years had received the first dose of a vaccine, compared with 83.0% of those aged 95 to 99 years. This age pattern holds after accounting for place of residence, underlying health conditions, geographic factors and indicators of socio-economic position.\nThe vaccination rate was lower for people living in a care home (86.4%) than those living in private households or other communal establishments (90.3%). Adjusting for age, sex, geography, socio-demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions reduces the estimated difference in the odds of not being vaccinated.\nFigure 2 shows that among adults aged 70 years and over, all ethnic minority groups (self-reported ethnicity in the 2011 Census) were less likely to have received the first dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine than people in the White British group.\nThe lowest rates were observed among people identifying as Black African (58.8%), Black Caribbean (68.7%), Bangladeshi (72.7%) and Pakistani (74.0 %). The vaccination rate among people from an Indian background was lower than that of the White British group but remains high at 86.2%.\nStatistical modelling shows that accounting for differences in geography, socio-demographic factors and underlying health conditions does not fully explain the lower vaccination rates among ethnic minority groups (Figure 3). For example, the odds of not having received a dose of the vaccine were 7.4 times greater for people from Black African backgrounds compared with people of White British ethnicity. After adjusting for age, sex, socio-demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions, the odds were still 5.5 times greater. This indicates that the factors included in the model explained only about 30% of the unadjusted differences in the odds of not having been vaccinated.\nDownload the data\nFor people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds, there was statistical evidence that the differences compared with White British people were more pronounced among those living in deprived areas (bottom IMD quintile) than among those living in wealthier areas (see the accompanying dataset).\nFigure 3 shows that among adults aged 70 years and over, those who identified as Christian had the highest vaccination rate (91.1%). The vaccination rate was lower for all other groups, with the lowest rates of vaccination being seen among those identifying as Muslim (72.3%) and Buddhist (78.1%).\nAfter accounting for differences in geography, socio-demographic factors and underlying health conditions, the odds ratios of not being vaccinated for people who identified as Jewish or Sikh were not different from one, suggesting that the difference in vaccination rate between these groups and those identifying as Christian may be attributable to differences in these factors (see the accompanying dataset).\nGeographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and underlying health conditions only partly explained the lower vaccination rates among those identifying as Muslim and Buddhist, as the odds ratios for not being vaccinated from fully adjusted models remained well above one.\nVaccination rates were lowest among those who reported being disabled at the time of the 2011 Census, compared with those who did not. Those disabled people who reported being limited a lot in their day-to-day activities had a vaccination rate of 86.6% compared with 91.0% of non-disabled people. \nThe lower vaccination rates among disabled people were not fully explained by geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions (see the accompanying dataset).\nFigure 5 shows a clear relationship between area deprivation, measured as quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), and vaccination rates, with rates being higher in less deprived areas. The vaccination rate in the most deprived areas was 87.0%, compared with 92.1% in the least deprived.

All estimates are subject to uncertainty, given that a sample is only part of the wider population. The model used to provide these estimates is a Bayesian model: these provide 95% credible intervals. A credible interval gives an indication of the uncertainty of an estimate from data analysis. 95% credible intervals are calculated so that there is a 95% probability of the true value lying in the interval. \n2. Official reported estimates are plotted at a reference point believed to be most representative of the given week. \n3. The official estimate presents the best estimate at that point in time. Modelled estimates are used to calculate the official reported estimate. The model smooths the series to understand the trend and is revised each week to incorporate new test results, providing the best indication of trend over time. \n4. Survey fieldwork for the pilot study began in England on 26 April 2020. In Wales, fieldwork began on 29 June 2020, in Northern Ireland fieldwork began on 26 July 2020 and in Scotland fieldwork began on 21 September 2020.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest five.\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\nAs this is a household survey, our figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In these settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 in care homes can be found in\u00a0Impact of coronavirus in care homes in England: 26 May to 19 June 2020.\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate and is used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.

During the week ending 27 March 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive was observed in the North East and Yorkshire and The Humber.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 27 March 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the East of England and decreased in the South East and South West. The trend was uncertain for all other regions.

This causes variability between estimates over time, which is expected given the lower number of positive tests within each region, compared with England as a whole.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) for regions in England are available in our\u00a0dataset\u00a0and provide an alternative measure over time for context.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether they are in school Year 6 or 7 (birthday before or after 1 September).\nSimilarly, 16- to 17-year-olds are split depending on whether they are in school Years 11 or 12 (birthday before or after 1 September).\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in our dataset that accompanies this bulletin. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive in England decreased in those aged 50 to 69 years in the week ending 27 March 2021. Trends are uncertain in all other age groups. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trend.\nDownload the data\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 3 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce estimates on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model. These can be found in the following section and in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. This uses a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously for England and are therefore not comparable.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0dataset, and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is produced by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries (England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland) from 14 February 2021. These estimates use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously in this section and estimates are therefore not comparable.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within the different ages relative to their respective national sample. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in our dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. \n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age from 14 February 2021 to 27 March 2021, for each of the four UK countries.\nDownload the data\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0dataset, and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nThis week we continue to present estimates of incidence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases using a new method based on our positivity estimate. This gives the rate at which new positives occur, and subsequently become detectable, within the population.\nOur incidence estimates for 13 July to 28 November 2020 considered new infections identified by new positive tests during the study compared with the number of days participants were \"at risk\". This new method accounts for the increasing proportion of survey participants providing monthly (rather than weekly) swabs.\nThe new incidence method uses an estimate of the length of time for which an individual will test positive, based on modelling the time from first positive to first subsequent negative test in the survey. This estimate is used alongside the positivity model to produce an estimate. This method is robust to participants having monthly swabs. For more information on the new method of incidence, see our updated\u00a0methods article. \nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 10 days prior to the end of the positivity reference week. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data.\nEstimates are included for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nIn England, during the week ending 20 March 2021, we estimate that there were 2.29 new PCR-positive coronavirus (COVID-19) cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 1.76 to 2.68). This equates to 12,500 new positive cases in England per day (95% credible interval: 9,600 to 14,600). There are early signs of an increase in the incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases over the fortnight up to 20 March 2021 in England.\nFor estimates of incidence in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, credible intervals are wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results. In particular, when prevalence is very low it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances, we will still provide the upper bound of the credible interval.\nIn Wales, during the week ending 20 March 2021, we estimate that there were 1.42 new PCR-positive coronavirus cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.32 to 2.78). This equates to 430 new positive cases in Wales per day (95% credible interval: 100 to 840). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases appears to have been level in recent weeks up to 20 March 2021 in Wales, although credible intervals are wide because of the smaller sample size.\nIn Northern Ireland, during the week ending 20 March 2021, we estimate that there were 4.02 new PCR-positive coronavirus cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 1.60 to 7.03). This equates to 740 new positive cases in Northern Ireland per day (95% credible interval: 290 to 1,300). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases appears to be increasing in the fortnight up to 20 March 2021 in Northern Ireland, although credible intervals are wide because of the smaller sample size.\nIn Scotland, during the week ending 20 March 2021, we estimate that there were 3.46 new PCR-positive coronavirus cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 1.84 to 5.28). This equates to 1,800 new positive cases in Scotland per day (95% credible interval: 970 to 2,800). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases decreased in the week up to 20 March 2021 in Scotland, although credible intervals are wide because of the smaller sample size.\nFigure 5 presents the official incidence estimates for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland for the week ending 20 March 2021. Modelled estimates for the most recent five weeks are also provided for each of the four countries.\nFor England, estimates between 29 November 2020 and the 6 March 2021 have also been provided as indicative estimates. For Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, indicative estimates are provided between 25 October 2020 and 6 March 2021. These indicative estimates are based on our new model and are presented on the official estimates chart. Figure 5 also shows previously published official estimates of incidence for England using our old model.\nDownload the data\nThe incidence rate measures the occurrence of new PCR-positive cases of COVID-19, and the calculation of this is defined in\u00a0Section 10: Glossary. The incidence rate is not the same as the reproduction rate (R), which is the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected person.\nTo calculate the estimated average number of people becoming PCR-positive per day, we multiply the daily incidence rate by the community population (see Coverage in\u00a0Section 11: Measuring the data). We use the unrounded incidence rate to do this, so results will differ if calculated using the rounded estimates from the dataset.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The UK variant of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes that coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the UK variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test.\nWhen there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious) absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab and N genes) is a reliable indicator of the UK variant in COVID-19. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of the UK variant.\nIn contrast, the South African and Brazilian variants have an S-gene that is detectable with the current test and will therefore be included in the \"not compatible with UK variant\" group of COVID-19 where the virus level is high enough to identify this. Which of these types of COVID-19 are compatible with these variants cannot be identified from the swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test alone. You can\u00a0read more about the UK variant\u00a0in our recent blog.\nSince 24 December 2020, we have reported on the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant that was identified in mid-November 2020. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nWe will continue to monitor the trends in different variants over the coming weeks and will reintroduce charts into the bulletin if there is a variant that we can identify using our test that appears to be affecting the trends in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19.\nThe percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant has likely levelled off in England, likely decreased in Wales and likely increased in Northern Ireland in the week ending 27 March 2021. In Scotland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant is uncertain in the week ending 27 March 2021.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"Cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low, under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on\u00a0sensitivity and specificity in our methods article.

More information about the methods used for our models is available in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThe analysis in this section looks at each person who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) who had a strong positive test. The strength of the test is determined by how quickly the virus is detected, measured by a cycle threshold (Ct) value. The lower the Ct value, the higher the viral load and stronger the positive test. Positive results with a high Ct value can be seen in the early stages of infection when virus levels are rising, or late in the infection, when the risk of transmission is low.\nParticipants who only have positive tests with these high values are excluded from this analysis to exclude the possibility that symptoms are not identified because we pick up individuals very early or later on in their infection. You can find more information on Ct values in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\nThis analysis considers individuals with any positive test (including repeated positive tests) that had a Ct value less than 30, between 1 December 2020 and 22 March 2021. This analysis considers all symptoms reported at visits within 35 days of the first positive test of the episode, and at each visit we ask about symptoms in the last seven days. This includes symptoms reported even when there is a negative test within this timeframe or a positive test with a higher Ct value. \u00a0\nIndividuals taking part in the survey were asked at each visit whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms1 in the seven days before they were tested and also separately whether they felt that they had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection in the last seven days.

This equates to 0.30% (95% credible interval: 0.26% to 0.34%) of the community population in England or around 1 in 340 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 380 to 1 in 300). Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in England was likely level over the two weeks up to 3 April 2021. There are early signs of an increase in the latest week, which balances out a small decrease seen the previous week so the trend over the two-week period is broadly level.\nIn Wales, we estimate that 3,800 people had COVID-19 over the same period (95% credible interval: 1,900 to 6,500). This equates to 0.12% (95% credible interval: 0.06% to 0.21%) of the community population in Wales or around 1 in 800 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 1,630 to 1 in 470).

The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 10.\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\nAs this is a household survey, our figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In these settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 in care homes can be found in\u00a0Impact of coronavirus in care homes in England: 26 May to 19 June 2020.\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate and is used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way.\nInformation about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our\u00a0methods article.\nWe are continuously refining and looking to improve our modelling and presentations.

During the week ending 3 April 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive was observed in the North West and Yorkshire and The Humber.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 3 April 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the North West and there were early signs of an increase in the South East. In the same week, the percentage of people testing positive continued to decrease in the South West, and there were early signs of a decrease in the North East. Trends in other regions are uncertain. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nDownload the data\nThe percentage of people testing positive by region was calculated using a similar modelling approach to the national daily estimates in\u00a0Section 2: Number of people in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who had COVID-19.\nThe analysis is conducted over a six-week period, which means specific positive cases move into and then out of the sample. This causes variability between estimates over time, which is expected given the lower number of positive tests within each region, compared with England as a whole.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) for regions in England are available in our\u00a0dataset\u00a0and provide an alternative measure over time for context.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether they are in school Year 6 or 7 (birthday before or after 1 September).\nSimilarly, 16- to 17-year-olds are split depending on whether they are in school Years 11 or 12 (birthday before or after 1 September).\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in our dataset that accompanies this bulletin. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive in England increased in those aged 50 to 69 years in the week ending 3 April 2021. There were also early signs of an increase in the percentage of people testing positive in those in school Year 12 to age 24 years. Trends are uncertain in all other age groups. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trend.\nDownload the data\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 3 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce estimates on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model. These can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. This uses a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously for England and are therefore not comparable.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0dataset, and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nAn interactive chart showing the percentage testing positive by single year of age over time for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published fortnightly and will be included in our next bulletin.\nFurther analysis on age for Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is produced by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\nThis week we continue to present estimates of incidence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases using a new method based on our positivity estimate. This gives the rate at which new positives occur, and subsequently become detectable, within the population.\nOur incidence estimates for 13 July to 28 November 2020 considered new infections identified by new positive tests during the study compared with the number of days participants were \"at risk\". This new method accounts for the increasing proportion of survey participants providing monthly (rather than weekly) swabs.\nThe new incidence method uses an estimate of the length of time for which an individual will test positive, based on modelling the time from first positive to first subsequent negative test in the survey. This estimate is used alongside the positivity model to produce an incidence estimate. This method is robust to participants having monthly swabs. For more information on the new method of incidence, see our updated\u00a0methods article.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 10 days prior to the end of the positivity reference week. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data.\nEstimates are included for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nIn England, during the week ending 27 March 20211, we estimate that there were 2.75 new PCR-positive coronavirus (COVID-19) cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 2.15 to 3.02). This equates to 15,000 new positive cases in England per day (95% credible interval: 11,700 to 16,500). The incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases increased over the fortnight up to 27 March 2021 in England.\nFor estimates of incidence in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, credible intervals are wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results. In particular, when prevalence is very low it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances, we will still provide the upper bound of the credible interval.\nIn Wales, during the week ending 27 March 2021, we estimate that there were 1.10 new PCR-positive coronavirus cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.16 to 2.24). This equates to 330 new positive cases in Wales per day (95% credible interval: 50 to 680). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Wales appears level in the fortnight up to 27 March 2021, but uncertainty is high.\nIn Northern Ireland, during the week ending 27 March 2021, we estimate that there were 2.87 new PCR-positive coronavirus cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.71 to 5.48). This equates to 530 new positive cases in Northern Ireland per day (95% credible interval: 130 to 1,000). The trend in incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Northern Ireland is uncertain in the week ending 27 March 2021.\nIn Scotland, during the week ending 27 March 2021, we estimate that there were 2.68 new PCR-positive coronavirus cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 1.20 to 4.08). This equates to 1,400 new positive cases in Scotland per day (95% credible interval: 630 to 2,100). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Scotland decreased in the fortnight up to 27 March 2021.\nFigure 4 presents the official incidence estimates for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland for the week ending 27 March 2021. Modelled estimates for the most recent five weeks are also provided for each of the four countries.\nFor England, estimates between 29 November 2020 and 6 March 2021 have also been provided as indicative estimates. For Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, indicative estimates are provided between 25 October 2020 and 6 March 2021. These indicative estimates are based on our new model and are presented on the official estimates chart. Figure 4 also shows previously published official estimates of incidence for England using our old model.\nDownload the data\nThe incidence rate measures the occurrence of new PCR-positive cases of COVID-19, and the calculation of this is defined in\u00a0Section 10: Glossary. The incidence rate is not the same as the reproduction rate (R), which is the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected person.\nTo calculate the estimated average number of people becoming PCR-positive per day, we multiply the daily incidence rate by the community population (see Coverage in\u00a0Section 11: Measuring the data). We use the unrounded incidence rate to do this, so results will differ if calculated using the rounded estimates from the dataset.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The UK variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes that coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the UK variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Other variants, including B.1.525 (first identified in Nigeria) may also have this same pattern of gene positivity. At present these are rare in the UK so we continue to describe this group as compatible with the UK variant, but we will continue to review.\nWhen there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious) absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab and N genes) is a reliable indicator of the UK variant in COVID-19. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of the UK variant.\nIn contrast, the South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (P.1 and P.2) variants have an S-gene that is detectable with the current test and will therefore be included in the \"not compatible with UK variant\" group of COVID-19 where the virus level is high enough to identify this. Which of these types of COVID-19 are compatible with these variants cannot be identified from the swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test alone. You can\u00a0read more about the UK variant\u00a0in our recent blog.\nSince 24 December 2020, we have reported on the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant that was identified in mid-November 2020. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nWe will continue to monitor the trends in different variants over the coming weeks and will reintroduce charts into the bulletin if there is a variant that we can identify using our test that appears to be affecting the trends in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19.\nThe percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant increased in England in the week ending 3 April 2021. In Wales and Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant decreased in the week ending 3 April 2021. In the same week, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant was uncertain in Northern Ireland.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"Cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be.

This equates to 0.21% (95% credible interval: 0.18% to 0.24%) of the community population in England or around 1 in 480 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 560 to 1 in 420). Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in England decreased in the week ending 10 April 2021. \nIn Wales, we estimate that 3,300 people had COVID-19 over the same period (95% credible interval: 1,500 to 6,000). This equates to 0.11% (95% credible interval: 0.05% to 0.20%) of the community population in Wales or around 1 in 920 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 2,080 to 1 in 510). Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in Wales decreased in the two weeks up to 10 April 2021.\nIn Northern Ireland, we estimate that 2,600 people had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 1,000 to 5,100).

Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in Scotland decreased in the week ending 10 April 2021.\nBecause of lower positivity rates, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs from 3 May 2020\nData download\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 10.\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\nAs this is a household survey, our figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In these settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 in care homes can be found in\u00a0Impact of coronavirus in care homes in England: 26 May to 19 June 2020.\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate and is used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way.\nInformation about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our\u00a0methods article.\nWe are continuously refining and looking to improve our modelling and presentations.

During the week ending 10 April 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive was observed in the North West.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 10 April 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in Yorkshire and The Humber and the South East. The trend over the most recent week up to 10 April 2021 is uncertain in the remaining regions. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs, daily, by region since 28 February 2021, England\nData download\nThe percentage of people testing positive by region was calculated using a similar modelling approach to the national daily estimates in\u00a0Section 2: Number of people in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who had COVID-19.\nThe analysis is conducted over a six-week period, which means specific positive cases move into and then out of the sample. This causes variability between estimates over time, which is expected given the lower number of positive tests within each region, compared with England as a whole.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) for regions in England are available in our\u00a0dataset\u00a0and provide an alternative measure over time for context.\nBecause of low positivity we are reviewing our methodology for providing sub-regional positivity estimates for the four UK countries.\nThis review will ensure we continue to provide accurate estimates of positivity at the sub-regional level and our statistics continue to be of high quality. As a result, we have not produced sub-regional estimates of positivity for the four UK countries this week.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether they are in school Year 6 or 7 (birthday before or after 1 September).\nSimilarly, 16- to 17-year-olds are split depending on whether they are in school Years 11 or 12 (birthday before or after 1 September).\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in our dataset that accompanies this bulletin. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 10 April 2021, the percentages of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) in England have decreased in most age groups, except school Years 7 to 11 and in those aged 50 to 69 years where the trend is uncertain. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trend.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs, daily, by age group since 28 February 2021, England\nData download \nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 3 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce estimates on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model. These can be found in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin. This uses a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously for England and are therefore not comparable.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 28 February 2021. These estimates use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously, and are therefore not comparable.\n\n!\n\nThese estimates are based on smaller sample sizes within the different ages relative to their respective national sample. Therefore, there is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in our dataset that accompanies this bulletin. \n\n\n\nAs the percentage of people testing positive decreases, the positivity estimates by single year of age by country are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the confidence intervals. We will continue to monitor this over the coming weeks.\nFigure 4 shows the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age from 28 February 2021 to 10 April 2021, for each of the four UK countries. \nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs, daily, by single year of age since 28 February 2021, UK\nData download \nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our dataset, and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh.\nThis week we continue to present estimates of the incidence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases using a new method based on our positivity estimate. This gives the rate at which new positives occur, and subsequently become detectable, within the population.\nThis incidence method uses an estimate of the length of time for which an individual will test positive, based on modelling the time from first positive to first subsequent negative test in the survey. This estimate is used alongside the positivity model to produce an estimate. This method is robust to participants having monthly swabs. For more information on the new method of incidence, see our updated\u00a0methods article.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 10 days prior to the end of the positivity reference week. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data.\nEstimates are included for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nIn England, during the week ending 3 April 2021\u00b9, we estimate that there were 2.04 new PCR-positive coronavirus (COVID-19) cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 1.64 to 2.47). This equates to 11,100 new positive cases in England per day (95% credible interval: 9,000 to 13,500). There appears to be early signs of a decrease in the incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in the week up to 3 April 2021 in England.\nFor estimates of incidence in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, credible intervals are wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results. In particular, when prevalence is very low it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances, we will still provide the upper bound of the credible interval.\nIn Wales, during the week ending 3 April 2021, we estimate that there were 0.77 new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.04 to 1.87). This equates to 230 new positive cases in Wales per day (95% credible interval: 10 to 570). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Wales appears to have remained level in the weeks up to 3 April 2021, but credible intervals are wide so there is high uncertainty.\nIn Northern Ireland, during the week ending 3 April 2021, we estimate that there were 0.89 new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0 to 2.89). This equates to 160 new positive cases in Northern Ireland per day (95% credible interval: 0 to 530). The incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Northern Ireland decreased in the week ending 3 April 2021, although credible intervals are wide so there is high uncertainty.\nIn Scotland, during the week ending 3 April 2021, we estimate that there were 1.69 new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.57 to 3.03). This equates to 890 new positive cases in Scotland per day (95% credible interval: 300 to 1,600). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Scotland decreased in the week up to 3 April 2021, although credible intervals are wide.\nFigure 5 presents the official incidence estimates for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland for the week ending 3 April 2021. Modelled estimates for the most recent five weeks are also provided for each of the four countries.\nFor England, estimates between 29 November 2020 and 6 March 2021 have also been provided as indicative estimates. For Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, indicative estimates are provided between 25 October 2020 and 6 March 2021. These indicative estimates are based on our new model and are presented on the official estimates chart. Figure 5 also shows previously published official estimates of incidence for England using our old model.\nEstimated numbers of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in the UK, based on nose and throat swabs with modelled estimates from 28 February 2021\nData download\nThe incidence rate measures the occurrence of new PCR-positive cases of COVID-19, and the calculation of this is defined in Section 10: Glossary. The incidence rate is not the same as the reproduction rate (R), which is the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected person.\nTo calculate the estimated average number of people becoming PCR-positive per day, we multiply the daily incidence rate by the community population (see Coverage in Section 11: Measuring the data). We use the unrounded incidence rate to do this, so results will differ if calculated using the rounded estimates from the dataset.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The UK variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes that coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the UK variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Other variants, including B.1.525 (first identified in Nigeria), also have this same pattern of gene positivity. At present these variants are rare in the UK so we continue to describe this group as compatible with the UK variant, but we will continue to review.\nWhen there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious) absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab and N genes) is a reliable indicator of the UK variant in COVID-19. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of the UK variant.\nIn contrast, the South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (P.1 and P.2) variants have an S-gene that is detectable with the current test and will therefore be included in the \"not compatible with UK variant\" group of COVID-19 where the virus level is high enough to identify this. Which of these types of COVID-19 are compatible with these variants cannot be identified from the swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test alone. You can\u00a0read more about the UK variant\u00a0in our recent blog.\nSince 24 December 2020, we have reported on the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant that was identified in mid-November 2020. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nWe will continue to monitor the trends in different variants over the coming weeks and will reintroduce charts into the bulletin if there is a variant that we can identify using our test that appears to be affecting the trends in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19.\nThe percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant decreased in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the week ending 10 April 2021. In the same week, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant was level in England and uncertain in Wales.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low, under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on\u00a0sensitivity and specificity in our methods article. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey Dataset | Released 16 April 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

Overall, all main sectors of GDP remain below their pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels, but only services remains notably lower than the initial recovery peak in October 2020.\nOutput growth in the services sector was broadly flat in February 2021 (grew by just 0.2%) as coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions remained largely unchanged; this follows negative 2.5% growth in January 2021. The largest contributor to growth in services output in February 2021 was wholesale and retail trade as sales picked up slightly. However, the services sector remains 8.8% below the level of February 2020 compared with 3.9% below its initial recovery peak in October 2020.\nThe production sector also grew in February 2021, by 1.0%. This was mainly because of manufacturing output picking up for the first time since November 2020 as the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers grew following contraction in the previous two months. The production sector is now 3.5% below its February 2020 level. \nThe construction sector saw growth of 1.6% in February 2021, driven by both new work and repair and maintenance. The construction sector is now 4.3% below the level of February 2020. \nLooking ahead, initial results from Wave 27 of the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS), which covered the dates 8 to 21 March 2021, found that of businesses currently trading, 40% reported a negative impact on their turnover compared with what is normally expected for this time of year. This compares with 44% reporting decreases in Wave 25 (8 to 21 February 2021). \nThe monthly growth rate for GDP is volatile. It should therefore be used with caution and alongside other measures, such as the three-month growth rate, when looking for an indicator of the medium-term trend of the economy. However, it is useful in highlighting one-off changes that can be masked by three-month growth rates.\nGDP contracted by 1.6% in the three months to February 2021, down from a revised 1.4% contraction in the three months to January 2021. \nAs part of this release we are also taking on changes to data through 2020 as published in the UK quarterly national accounts, October to December 2020. Table 2 shows how revisions to monthly GDP headline growth across 2020 averaged 0.23 percentage points, in absolute terms. The largest revisions were seen in April 2020 (a 0.4 percentage points downward revision to negative 18.7% growth) and July 2020 (a 0.6 percentage points upward revision to 7.3% growth). Revisions to service sector growth throughout 2020 is the main cause of this; largely a result of the incorporation of Value Added Tax (VAT) turnover data up to Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2020 as well as updated methods relating to the measurement of education in the pandemic. Revisions to construction sector growth are also the result of the incorporation of VAT turnover data. More detail on reasons behind revisions can be found in GDP Quarterly National Accounts: October to December 2020. \nServices output grew by just 0.2% in February 2021 as coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions remained largely unchanged; this follows a revised negative 2.5% growth in January 2021. The services sector remains 8.8% below the pre-pandemic level of February 2020. \nFigure 3 shows the performance of total services output, a composite industrial indicator based on output in consumer-facing services, and output in all other industries in the services sector. In January 2021, consumer-facing services such as trade of motor vehicles and retail trade as well as food and beverage services weakened as restrictions were reintroduced across the UK. These weaknesses largely remained in February 2021 as restrictions remained broadly unchanged. However, wholesale and retail trade did pick up in sales, growing 3.3% and contributing to the 0.2% growth in services. Overall, in February 2021, consumer-facing services were 18.6% below pre-pandemic levels (February 2020), while all other services were 7% below pre-pandemic levels. \n\n!\n\nDifferences in the methods for estimating the output of health and education services across different countries mean GDP maybe less internationally comparable during the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery than usual, so should be made with increased caution.\n\n\n\nHealth output saw a slight contraction in February 2021 of 2.7%. This follows historically high output levels in January 2021, mainly due to coronavirus testing and tracing and vaccine schemes across the UK. Adjustments for these programmes decreased overall GDP by 0.1 percentage points in February 2021 in comparison to January 2021; some of these adjustments are in other industries than health. More information is available in Section 8: Measuring the data.\nService sector growth for January 2021 was revised upwards by 1.0 percentage points to negative 2.5%. Almost half of the upward revision was because of upward revisions in accommodation and food service activities, where growth was revised up by 13 percentage points to negative 15.1%. Most of the revisions across services were because of the incorporation of late survey returns. \nServices output contracted by 1.9% in the three months to February 2021. This was driven by decreases in education services and wholesale and retail trade, partly offset by growth in human health and social work activities. \nProduction increased by 1.0% in February 2021, with growth in three out of the four sub-sectors. The manufacturing sub-sector was the largest contributor to growth in production as it increased by 1.3%. This follows a contraction in January 2021 and a revised contraction in December 2020, which was the first decline since April 2020. Seven out of the thirteen manufacturing sub-sectors grew. The largest positive contributions came from the manufacture of transport equipment sector (which grew by 5.4%) and manufacturing of computer, electronic and optical products (which grew by 9.0%).\nMining and quarrying declined by 2.1% in February 2021. Oil and gas extraction has seen large declines since June 2020, mainly because of tightened COVID-19 restrictions impacting on demand. Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply increased by 0.5% (its fourth month of consecutive growth), while water supply increased 1.4% in February 2021. \nOutput in the production sector fell by 0.1% in the three months to February 2021. This was driven by a fall in manufacturing in both December 2020 and January 2021. \nConstruction output grew by 1.6% in February 2021 following revised flat growth in January 2021 (revised down from 0.9% growth due to late survey returns). The monthly growth was driven by both a rise in repair and maintenance (1.9%) and in new work (1.5%). \nThe growth in repair and maintenance was mainly driven by private housing (growing 4.7%). The growth in new work was mainly driven by private commercial (growing 4.0%) and public housing (growing 13.5%). \nPrevious estimates suggested that construction had recovered to its pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels in November 2020, however, following revisions, the construction sector in February 2021 is 4.3% below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe construction sector contracted by 1.0% in the three months to February 2021. The main contributors were new work in private commercial, private new housing and private industrial, which contracted by 5.3%, 2.3% and 13.6% respectively. \n\nMonthly gross domestic product by gross value added  Dataset | Released 13 April 2021  The gross value added (GVA) tables showing the monthly and annual growths and indices as published within the monthly gross domestic product (GDP) statistical bulletin.Contributions to monthly GDP  Dataset | Released 13 April 2021  Contributions to growth within monthly gross domestic product (GDP), UK.Monthly gross domestic product: time series  Dataset | Dataset ID: MGDP | Released 13 April 2021  Monthly estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) containing constant price gross value added (GVA) data for the UK.Monthly GDP and main sectors to four decimal places  Dataset | Released 13 April 2021  Monthly index values for monthly gross domestic product (GDP) and the main sectors in the UK to four decimal places.Revisions triangles for monthly GDP  Dataset | Released 13 April 2021  Comparison of gross domestic product (GDP) first estimates against estimates published later. \n\n\n", "summary": "The economy grew by 0.4% in February 2021\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by 0.4% in February 2021 following a revised fall of 2.2% in January 2021.\nRestrictions were in place to varying degrees across all four nations of the UK throughout January and February.

Overall, all main sectors of GDP remain below their pre-pandemic levels, but only services remains notably lower than the initial recovery peak in October 2020.\nOutput growth in the services sector was broadly flat in February 2021 (grew by just 0.2%) as coronavirus restrictions remained largely unchanged; this follows negative 2.5% growth in January 2021.\nOverall, in February 2021, consumer-facing services were 18.6% below pre-pandemic levels (February 2020), while all other services were 7% below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe production sector grew in February 2021, by 1.0%.

We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period.\nAll analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nEarly management information from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey is\u00a0made available to government decision-makers to inform their response to COVID-19.

This equates to 0.17% (95% credible interval: 0.14% to 0.19%) of the community population in England or around 1 in 610 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 720 to 1 in 520). Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in England has continued to decrease in the week ending 16 April 2021.\nIn Wales, we estimate that 3,600 people had COVID-19 over the same period (95% credible interval: 1,700 to 6,400). This equates to 0.12% (95% credible interval: 0.06% to 0.21%) of the community population in Wales or around 1 in 840 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 1,810 to 1 in 480). Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in Wales appears to have been level in the week ending 16 April 2021.\nIn Northern Ireland, we estimate that 2,800 people had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 1,100 to 5,300). This equates to 0.15% (95% credible interval: 0.06% to 0.29%) of the population in Northern Ireland or around 1 in 660 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 1,640 to 1 in 350). Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in Northern Ireland decreased in the two weeks up to 16 April 2021.\nIn Scotland, we estimate that 9,300 people had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 5,500 to 14,300). This equates to 0.18% (95% credible interval: 0.10% to 0.27%) of the population in Scotland or around 1 in 560 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 960 to 1 in 370). Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in Scotland continued to decrease in the week ending 16 April 2021.\nBecause of lower positivity rates caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs from 3 May 2020\nDownload the data\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 10.\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\nAs this is a household survey, our figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In these settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 in care homes can be found in\u00a0Impact of coronavirus in care homes in England: 26 May to 19 June 2020.\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way.\nInformation about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our\u00a0methods article.\nWe are continuously refining and looking to improve our modelling and presentations. We would welcome any feedback via email:\u00a0infection.survey.analysis@ons.gov.uk.\nFor information about the potential impact of false-positive and false-negative test results, see our\u00a0methods article.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

During the week ending 16 April 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive was observed in the North West, although rates were low in all regions and credible intervals are wide.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 16 April 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the North East, North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands and London. The trend over the most recent week up to 16 April 2021 is uncertain in the remaining regions. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs, daily, by region since 6 March 2021, England\nDownload the data\nThe percentage of people testing positive by region was calculated using a similar modelling approach to the national daily estimates in\u00a0Section 2: Number of people in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who had COVID-19.\nThe analysis is conducted over a six-week period, which means specific positive cases move into and then out of the sample. This causes variability between estimates over time, which is expected given the lower number of positive tests within each region, compared with England as a whole.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) for regions in England are available in our\u00a0England dataset\u00a0and provide an alternative measure over time for context.\nWhen infections are low, it becomes more difficult to break the estimates down into smaller geographic areas. Because of this low positivity, we are reviewing our methodology for providing sub-regional positivity estimates for the four UK countries.\nThis review will ensure we continue to provide accurate estimates of positivity at the sub-regional level and our statistics continue to be of high quality. As a result, we have not produced sub-regional estimates of positivity for the four UK countries this week.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether they are in school Year 6 or 7 (birthday before or after 1 September).\nSimilarly, 16- to 17-year-olds are split depending on whether they are in school Years 11 or 12 (birthday before or after 1 September).\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0accompanying datasets. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 16 April 2021, the percentage of people testing positive in England has decreased in those aged two years to school Year 6 and those over the age of 35 years. For all other age groups, the trend is uncertain in the most recent week, but rates have likely decreased over the two weeks up to 16 April 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trend.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs, daily, by age group since 6 March 2021, England\nDownload the data\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 3 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce estimates on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model. These can be found in the\u00a0accompanying datasets. This uses a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously for England and are therefore not comparable.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our\u00a0datasets, and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nAn interactive chart showing the percentage testing positive by single year of age over time for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published fortnightly and will be included in our next bulletin.\nFurther analysis on age for Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\nThis week we continue to present estimates of the incidence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases using a new method based on our positivity estimate. This gives the rate at which new positives occur, and subsequently become detectable, within the population.\nThis incidence method uses an estimate of the length of time for which an individual will test positive, based on modelling the time from first positive to first subsequent negative test in the survey. This estimate is used alongside the positivity model to produce an estimate. This method is robust to participants having monthly swabs. For more information on the incidence method, see our methods article.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 10 days prior to the end of the positivity reference week. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data.\nEstimates are included for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nIn England, during the week ending 9 April 2021\u00b9, we estimate that there were 1.31 new PCR-positive coronavirus (COVID-19) cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.97 to 1.66). This equates to 7,100 new positive cases in England per day (95% credible interval: 5,300 to 9,100). The incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases has decreased in the week ending 9 April 2021 in England.\nFor estimates of incidence in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, credible intervals are wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results. In particular, when prevalence is very low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances, we will still provide the upper bound of the credible interval.\nIn Wales, during the week ending 9 April 2021, we estimate that there were 0.82 new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.13 to 1.82). This equates to 250 new positive cases in Wales per day (95% credible interval: 40 to 550). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Wales appears to have remained level in the weeks up to 9 April 2021, but credible intervals are wide so there is high uncertainty.\nIn Northern Ireland, during the week ending 9 April 2021, we estimate that there were 1.15 new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.02 to 2.78). This equates to 210 new positive cases in Northern Ireland per day (95% credible interval: 0 to 510). The trend of incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Northern Ireland is uncertain in the week ending 9 April 2021, although credible intervals are wide.\nIn Scotland, during the week ending 9 April 2021, we estimate that there were 1.21 new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.28 to 2.35). This equates to 640 new positive cases in Scotland per day (95% credible interval: 150 to 1,200). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Scotland has decreased in the two weeks up to 9 April 2021, although credible intervals are wide.\nFigure 4 presents the official incidence estimates for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland for the week ending 9 April 2021. Modelled estimates for the most recent five weeks are also provided for each of the four countries.\nFor England, estimates between 29 November 2020 and 6 March 2021 have also been provided as indicative estimates. For Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, indicative estimates are provided between 25 October 2020 and 6 March 2021. These indicative estimates are based on our new model and are presented on the official estimates chart. Figure 4 also shows previously published official estimates of incidence for England using our old model.\nEstimated numbers of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in the UK, based on nose and throat swabs with modelled estimates from 6 March 2021\nDownload the data\nThe incidence rate measures the occurrence of new PCR-positive cases of COVID-19, and the calculation of this is defined in\u00a0Section 10: Glossary. The incidence rate is not the same as the reproduction rate (R), which is the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected person.\nTo calculate the estimated average number of people becoming PCR-positive per day, we multiply the daily incidence rate by the community population (see Coverage in\u00a0Section 11: Measuring the data). We use the unrounded incidence rate to do this, so results will differ if calculated using the rounded estimates from the datasets.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The UK variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes that coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the UK variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Other variants, including B.1.525 (first identified in Nigeria), also have this same pattern of gene positivity. At present these are rare in the UK so we continue to describe this group as compatible with the UK variant, but we will continue to keep this under review.\nWhen there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious) absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab and N genes) is a reliable indicator of the UK variant in COVID-19. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of the UK variant.\nIn contrast, the South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (P.1 and P.2) variants have an S-gene that is detectable with the current test and will therefore be included in the \"not compatible with UK variant\" group of COVID-19 where the virus level is high enough to identify this. Which of these types of COVID-19 are compatible with these variants cannot be identified from the swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test alone. You can\u00a0read more about the UK variant\u00a0in our blog.\nSince 24 December 2020, we have reported on the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant that was identified in mid-November 2020. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying\u00a0technical dataset.\nWe will continue to monitor the trends in different variants over the coming weeks and will reintroduce charts into the bulletin if there is a variant that we can identify using our test that appears to be affecting the trends in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19.\nThe percentage of people testing positive that are compatible with the UK variant decreased in England in the week ending 16 April 2021. In the same week, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive that are compatible with the UK variant was uncertain in Northern Ireland and Scotland, and there were early signs of a possible increase in Wales.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0technical dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus's genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30) - this is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in Office for National Statistics (ONS) data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher). Where we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which virus is which type of variant.\nThese data are provided in the accompanying technical dataset using the international standard labels. For example, the UK variant is B.1.1.7, and the South African variant is B.1.351. We have not seen any of the Manaus variant to date (P.1). We also provide information on viruses where we have found a particular genetic change (mutation) called E484K. This mutation is always seen in the South African variant (B.1.351). Laboratory data suggest that this mutation might make it easier for a virus to infect someone again, or to infect someone who has been vaccinated but the importance of this is still uncertain.\nThis analysis was produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low -- under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test.

One clear exception was in London, where the proportion of people working from home was far higher than in any other region. \nWe did see differences in experience depending on the types of households people lived in, regardless of where they lived. For example, households with children across the nation were the most likely to report feeling worried about the effect the pandemic is having on their lives.\u201d\nJames, P Harris, Cities Statistician, Office for National Statistics\nThis bulletin presents data and indicators at the country and region level from a module being undertaken through the Office for National Statistics\u2019 (ONS) Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) to understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on British society.\nIn this bulletin we examine the social impacts of coronavirus on respondents belonging to different types of private households in regions of England, and in Wales and Scotland since March 2020. Types of households are based on self-reported data and were categorised as:\none adult, 16- to 64-years-old\none adult, 65-years-old or older\ntwo adults, both 16- to 64-years-old\ntwo adults, at least one of whom is 65-years-old or older\nthree or more adults, all ages\nhouseholds with one or more children (and any number of adults)\nAdditional data including measures for housing tenure (renters, mortgage, homeowners) and data on a city regions level can be found in the associated datasets. Changes in results from the different time points from this bulletin are presented, associated confidence intervals should be used to assess the statistical significance of this difference.\nThe earliest data from the coronavirus module of the survey covers the period 20 March to 31 May 2020 (providing survey data for 14,030 adults) and will be referred to as \u201cspring 2020\u201d. From the 23 March 2020, the whole of the UK was placed under lockdown measures, with schools shut, non-essential shops closed, and the population asked to work from home where possible and to only leave their houses for exercise and essentials. These measures began to be eased from mid-May.\nData points covering 4 June 2020 to 2 August 2020 will be referred to as \u201csummer 2020\u201d, providing data for 15,660 adults. During this period, restrictions were relaxed in most of Great Britain, including non-essential shops reopening and social distancing restrictions eased and the introduction of the \u201cone-metre plus\u201d rule as pubs, cinemas and restaurants reopened. \nThe latest data point in this analysis covers 7 January 2021 to 28 March 2021 and will be referred to as \u201cearly-2021 lockdown\u201d, covering responses for 52,020 adults. From 5 January 2021 the UK government announced a further national lockdown for England. Similar rules applied for Scotland and Wales, particularly the message to \"stay at home\" meaning that adults in Great Britain were under a national lockdown at the start of the year in 2021. The estimates presented here were collected before the \u201crule of six\u201d was introduced in England from 29 March 2021 but include the change from \u201cstay home\u201d to \u201cstay local\u201d in Wales from 13 March.\nFurther information on data coverage, including response rates can be found in Section 10: Measuring the data.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

Examples of direct physical contact may include shaking or holding hands, hugging and making contact when passing objects. This changed gradually over time, with lower levels seen in late August and early September (around 80%), rising again during the tier system and November 2020 lockdown. During the early 2021 lockdown, 92% reported that they had avoided contact.\nIn summer 2020, adults in households where at least one adult was over 65 years, or which were made up of single adults aged over 65 years, had the highest percentage of adults who reported they had avoided physical contact in most regions and countries. During this period, there was a wide range of avoidance (avoiding physical contact when outside) between different household types. \nThe biggest difference was in the North East, where adults in households where one adult is over 65 years (97%) and households with children (95%) were more cautious than respondents in other households. Estimates ranged from a minimum of 71% to 97% within the region. In early 2021 lockdown, avoidance levels were similar to summer 2020. This behaviour could reflect restrictions not being eased at the same pace compared with the rest of Great Britain as well as shielding of clinically and extremely vulnerable people still being in place during this period, around two-thirds of this group were aged over 60-years-old in England.\nFollowing the summer 2020 period, levels of avoidance rose in adults across all regions and countries. The biggest change was seen in London, where the percentage of adults avoiding contact rose from 81% to 90% in early 2021 lockdown. The increase seemed to be driven by all households except households where at least one adult was over 65 or which were made up of single adults aged over 65. These adults reported similar levels of avoidance in both periods.\nThe highest level of avoidance in early 2021 among all households in the regions and countries, was reported by households where at least one adult was over 65 years in Wales (99%, Figure 1) .\nMost adults across all household types in Great Britain reported they had left their home in the past seven days with the lowest levels seen in spring 2020 (88%), compared with summer 2020 (92%) and during the early-2021 lockdown (92%). The largest increase from spring 2020 to summer was seen in the South West (87% to 94%).\nA high proportion of adults in households where everyone was under 65 years consistently reported that they had left home since spring 2020. The highest proportions in each period were seen in single adults under 65 years in Wales (97%) in spring 2020, two adults under 65 years in the North East in summer 2020 (99%) and two adults under 65 years in Wales (97%) during the early 2021 lockdown. The lowest proportions in each period was seen in single adults over 65 years in the East of England in spring 2020 (64%), in the North West in summer 2020 (78%), and in West Midlands (83%) during the early 2021 lockdown.\nAdults aged over 65 years have increasingly reported leaving their homes since spring 2020. The proportion of single adults aged over 65 years who reported that they left their homes increased by 14 percentage points across Great Britain, with the highest increase seen in the North East, East Midlands, East of England and Wales (20 percentage point increase). \nAdults aged under 65 years (both single and in two person households) and households with children were most likely to report leaving home for work (of those who reported they left home for any reason) across all periods in Great Britain.\nThe biggest increase in adults leaving home for work was seen between spring 2020 and summer 2020, in the West Midlands (13 percentage point increase). The smallest increase was seen in the North West (4 percentage points). Adults from two person households and households with children in the West Midlands reported the biggest increase in people who reported leaving home for work in summer 2020 compared to spring 2020 (27% to 53% and 19% to 44%).\nAdults aged under 65 years in London were consistently less likely to report leaving home for work than other regions and countries. Despite a general increase during summer 2020, adults reporting they left home for work remained the lowest in London out of all the regions. \nThe proportion of working age adults and adults with children in London fell below the national average in all periods.\nAlmost half of working adults from two person households, single adult households under 65 years and households with children reported working from home (47%, 49% and 47%) in early 2021 lockdown. Adults belonging to single person households in London (71%) were most likely to report working from home, whereas single adults in the North East were least likely to report working from home (37%). \nAdults who reported they were able to work from home was similar in both the early 2021 lockdown and spring 2020. However, in subnational areas there were differences between the periods, particularly adults with children in Scotland, (where there was a 15 percentage point increase). For adults under 65 years, the biggest increase was by 10 percentage points, in the West Midlands.\nAcross all periods, adults belonging to households with children, and adults in two person households where one person was aged over 65 years were the groups who most frequently reported that they were worried or very worried about the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on their lives. The proportion of adults in these household types who reported this was above the national average in each period. For instance, in spring 2020, 79% of adults belonging to these types of households reported they were worried compared with 76% of all households. \nHowever, during the early 2021 lockdown, adults under 65 years reverted to worry levels similar to the spring 2020 period. The rise in percentage of adults under 65 years reporting that they were worried was driven by increases in the West Midlands, which saw a 12 percentage point increase of single adults under 65 years reporting that they were worried about the effect of the pandemic on their lives.\nAlmost 8 in 10 (79%) of adults in households with children reported being worried about the effect of the pandemic on their lives in spring 2020, compared with 71% in summer 2020 and 74% in early 2021. In spring 2020 and summer 2020, households with children in London were most worried (84% and 78%). During the early 2021 lockdown, Wales had the highest proportion of households with children reporting they were either worried or very worried about the impact of the pandemic on their lives (79%). \nGenerally, the proportion of all adults reporting they could afford an unexpected but necessary expense of \u00a3850 has remained stable in all periods at a national level. However, households with children and single adults under 65 years were consistently worse off when considering this measure across the different regions and countries.\nIn spring 2020, 58% of all adults said they would be able to afford an unexpected but necessary expense, compared with 45% of single adults and 46% of households with children.\nThe group most affected in this period were single adults in the North West (34%) and households with children in the North East (28%). Perceptions of this have improved for households with children in the North East, this group were more likely to report being able to afford an unexpected expense in summer 2020 (48%) and early 2021 (45%). Households with children in the North West were the only group whose assessment of their current financial situation got worse, 51% reported they were able to afford an unexpected expense in spring 2020, compared with 44% in early 2021.\nAdults in two person households under 65 years consistently reported being able to save money in the next 12 months, above the national average in all periods, and households with children were least likely to report being able to save. The greatest difference was in early 2021 lockdown, in London, where 63% of adults under 65 years reported they could save compared with 38% of households with children.\nFurther insight on households and their financial wellbeing is detailed in our latest Personal and economic wellbeing release.\nDuring the spring 2020, 62% of all adults thought life would return to normal in less than a year. Of the household types considered, adults in households with children (64%) and households with three or more adults of all ages (63%) were most likely to report this. Adults over 65 years were the least optimistic, 57% thought life would return to normal in less than a year. \nBy summer 2020, it had reduced to half (50%) of adults who thought life would return to normal in less than a year. Again, older households were least optimistic. The largest decreases were seen for households of single adults aged 16 years to 64 years which fell by 29 percentage points from around 70% to a little over 40% in Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands, and West Midlands. Whereas Great Britain as a whole became slightly more optimistic at 54% by early 2021, it was single adults aged 16 years to 64 years who were now least likely to think life would return to normal in less than a year. \nWhen considering regions, the largest reduction in optimism was seen in households of single adults aged 16 years to 64 years in Yorkshire and The Humber which experienced a 27 percentage point decrease in likelihood of thinking life would return to normal in early 2021 compared to spring 2020. In the latest data period, there is little variation between regions and countries in the proportion of people who thought life would return to normal.\n\nCoronavirus and the social impacts on households in subnational areas in Great Britain  Dataset | Released 27 April 2021  Indicators from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Opinions and Lifestyle Survey to understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on different households in subnational areas in Great Britain, 2020 and 2021.Coronavirus and the social impacts on city regions in Great Britain  Dataset | Released 27 April 2021  Indicators from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Opinions and Lifestyle Survey to understand the impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on city regions in Great Britain, 2020 and 2021. \n\n\n", "summary": "Regional differences in the proportion of adults working from home during the coronavirus lockdown\nThe biggest increases in the number of adults who were working from home during the coronavirus pandemic were seen in particular household types in Scotland and the West Midlands.\nWorking from home was one of many ways in which people\u2019s lives were affected in the regions and countries of Great Britain. Our analysis looks at the impact on households across significant points in the last year.\nWorkers living in one or two person households aged 16 to 64 years in London (70%) were most likely to report working from home in early 2021, whereas it was the North East where workers in similar households were least likely to report working from home (36%).\nThe proportion of workers who reported they were able to work from home was similar in both the early 2021 lockdown (7 January to 28 March 2021) and spring 2020 (20 March to 31 May 2020). However, in regions across Great Britain, there were differences between the periods, particularly adults with children in Scotland where there was a 15 percentage point increase, and adults with children in the North East a 11 percentage point increase. For one or two person households aged 16 to 64 years, the biggest increase was by 10 percentage points, in the West Midlands.\nPercentage of workers reporting working from home, Great Britain, countries and regions, spring 2020 and early 2021 lockdown\n", "id": 418}, {"document": "Provisional analysis show there were 11.7 suicide deaths per 100,000 people in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 in England, equivalent to 1,461 deaths registered; this rate is similar to rates seen in the fourth quarter of previous years.\nIn Quarter 4 2020 death registrations, there were 17.7 suicide deaths per 100,000 males (1,085 deaths registered) and 5.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 females (376 deaths registered); these rates are similar to rates observed in the same quarter in previous years.\nTaken as a whole, 4,902 suicides were registered in England in 2020, equivalent to a provisional rate of 9.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 people; this represents a statistically significant reduction in the rate from 2019 when there were 10.8 suicide deaths per 100,000, but caution is required in the interpretation of this decrease.\nThe reduction in the number of suicides registered in 2020 from the previous year most likely reflects delays to coroner inquests, because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as opposed to a genuine decrease in suicide.\nIf you are a journalist covering a suicide-related issue, please consider following the Samaritans' media guidelines on the reporting of suicide, owing to the potentially damaging consequences of irresponsible reporting.

This is in line with expectation, given coroner involvement with the investigation of these deaths and the amount of time it takes to hold an inquest.\n\n!\n\nAll deaths caused by suicide in England are investigated by coroners. Given the length of time it takes to hold an inquest, deaths tend to be registered around five to six months after they occurred. \n\n\n\nFor Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) of 2020, 3.3% of the 1,461 suicides registered in the period occurred in the same period (48 deaths), with the remaining deaths occurring in the first quarter of 2020 (17.9% or 261 deaths), the second quarter of 2020 (26.3% or 384 deaths), the third quarter of 2020 (30.5% or 445 deaths) or prior to 2020 (22.1% or 323 deaths). \nBased on the best available provisional data, 4,902 suicides were registered in England in 2020, equivalent to a provisional age-standardised mortality rate of 9.9 deaths per 100,000 people. The provisional suicide rate for 2020 is statistically significantly lower than the rate seen in 2019, when there were 10.8 suicides per 100,000 people (5,316 registered deaths).\nThese numbers should be interpreted with caution. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, during the second quarter (Apr to June) of 2020, there was a 36.1% reduction in the rate of suicide when compared with the same period in 2019. Since the third quarter (Jul to Sept) of 2020, numbers of registered suicides have returned to previously observed levels.\nThe number of suicides registered in the second quarter of 2020 is the lowest it has been since 2001, when the data time series reported for this statistical release begins. As opposed to representing a genuine change in suicide, the lower number of registrations in the second quarter of 2020 most likely reflects the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the coroner's service in England and Wales; for example, delays to inquests caused by the service adapting to social distancing measures.\nCompared with the second quarter of 2020, the number of registered suicides increased in the third and fourth quarters. The increase most likely reflects the resuming of coroner's inquests; the number of registered suicides in the second half of 2020 are like those seen in previous years.\nRegistration delays refer to the time between the date of death and its eventual registration after inquest. When calculating the average delay between occurrence and registration, the median is used rather than the mean, as the median is not affected by rare cases where it takes many years for the death to be registered. For suicides, the median registration delay in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) increased from 172 days in 2019 to 177 days in 2020. \nThe median registration delay increased across all regions of England except Yorkshire and The Humber, East of England, London and South West in the fourth quarter of 2020. It was highest in the East Midlands \u2013 254 days (up from 206 days in the same period in 2019).\n\nDeaths caused by suicide by quarter in England Dataset | Released 26 April 2021 Provisional rate and number of suicide deaths registered in England per quarter.

Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in Scotland has continued to decrease in the week ending 24 April 2021.\nBecause of lower positivity rates caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs from 3 May 2020\nDownload the data\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 10.\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\nAs this is a household survey, our figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In these settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 in care homes can be found in Impact of coronavirus in care homes in England: 26 May to 19 June 2020.\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way.\nInformation about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our methods article.\nWe are continuously refining and looking to improve our modelling and presentations. We would welcome any feedback via email: infection.survey.analysis@ons.gov.uk.\nFor information about the potential impact of false-positive and false-negative test results, see our methods article and our blog.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

During the week ending 24 April 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive was observed in Yorkshire and The Humber, although rates were low in all regions and credible intervals are wide.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 24 April 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in all regions except in Yorkshire and The Humber and the East of England where the trends are uncertain. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend. \nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs, daily, by region since 14 March 2021, England\nDownload the data\nThe percentage of people testing positive by region was calculated using a similar modelling approach to the national daily estimates in Section 2: Number of people in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who had COVID-19.\nThe analysis is conducted over a six-week period, which means specific positive cases move into and then out of the sample. This causes variability between estimates over time, which is expected given the lower number of positive tests within each region compared with England as a whole.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) for regions in England are available in our England dataset and provide an alternative measure over time for context.\nWhen infections are low, it becomes more difficult to break the estimates down into smaller geographic areas. Because of this low positivity, we are not providing sub-regional positivity estimates for the four countries.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether they are in school Year 6 or 7 (birthday before or after 1 September).\nSimilarly, 16- to 17-year-olds are split depending on whether they are in school Years 11 or 12 (birthday before or after 1 September).\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset.\n\n\n\nIn the week ending 24 April 2021, the percentage of people testing positive in England has decreased in those aged two years to school Year 11 and those aged 35 years and over. For those in school Year 12 to aged 34 years, the trend is uncertain in the week ending 24 April 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trend.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs, daily, by age group since 14 March 2021, England\nDownload the data\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 3 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. \nBecause of low positivity rates, we are reviewing whether we can continue to produce age over time analysis by single year of age for all four UK countries. As a result, we have not produced these data this week.\nThis week we continue to present estimates of the incidence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases using a new method based on our positivity estimate. This gives the rate at which new positives occur, and subsequently become detectable, within the population.\nThis incidence method uses an estimate of the length of time for which an individual will test positive, based on modelling the time from first positive to first subsequent negative test in the survey. This estimate is used alongside the positivity model to produce an estimate. This method is robust to participants having monthly swabs. For more information on the incidence method, see our methods article.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 10 days prior to the end of the positivity reference week. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data.\nIn England during the week ending 17 April 2021\u00b9, we estimate that there were 0.66 new PCR-positive coronavirus (COVID-19) cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.40 to 0.93). This equates to 3,600 new positive cases in England per day (95% credible interval: 2,200 to 5,100). The incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases has decreased in the week ending 17 April 2021 in England.\nFor estimates of incidence in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, credible intervals are wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results. In particular, when prevalence is very low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances, we will still provide the upper bound of the credible interval.\nIn Wales, during the week ending 17 April 2021, we estimate that there were 0.56 new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.06 to 1.43). This equates to 170 new positive cases in Wales per day (95% credible interval: 20 to 430). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Wales appears to have remained level in the weeks up to 17 April 2021, but credible intervals are wide so there is high uncertainty.\nIn Northern Ireland, during the week ending 17 April 2021, we estimate that there were 0.81 new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0 to 2.22). This equates to 150 new positive cases in Northern Ireland per day (95% credible interval: 0 to 410). The trend of incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Northern Ireland appears to have remained level in the weeks up to 17 April 2021, although credible intervals are wide.\nIn Scotland, during the week ending 17 April 2021, we estimate that there were 1.31 new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 0.51 to 2.37). This equates to 690 new positive cases in Scotland per day (95% credible interval: 270 to 1,200). Incidence of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in Scotland appears to have remained level in the weeks up to 17 April 2021, although credible intervals are wide.\nFigure 4 presents the official incidence estimates for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland for the week ending 17 April 2021. Modelled estimates for the most recent five weeks are also provided for each of the four countries.\nFor England, estimates between 29 November 2020 and 6 March 2021 have also been provided as indicative estimates. For Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, indicative estimates are provided between 25 October 2020 and 6 March 2021. These indicative estimates are based on our new model and are presented on the official estimates chart. Figure 4 also shows previously published official estimates of incidence for England using our old model.\nEstimated numbers of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in the UK, based on nose and throat swabs with modelled estimates from 14 March 2021\nDownload the data\nThe incidence rate measures the occurrence of new PCR-positive cases of COVID-19, and the calculation of this is defined in Section 10: Glossary. The incidence rate is not the same as the reproduction rate (R), which is the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected person.\nTo calculate the estimated average number of people becoming PCR-positive per day, we multiply the daily incidence rate by the community population (see Coverage in Section 11: Measuring the data). We use the unrounded incidence rate to do this, so results will differ if calculated using the rounded estimates from the datasets.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The UK variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes that coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the UK variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Other variants, including B.1.525 (first identified in Nigeria), also have this same pattern of gene positivity. At present these variants are rare in the UK so we continue to describe this group as compatible with the UK variant, but we will continue to keep this under review. \nWhen there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious) absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab and N genes) is a reliable indicator of the UK variant in COVID-19. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of the UK variant.\nIn contrast, the South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (P.1 and P.2) variants have an S-gene that is detectable with the current test and will therefore be included in the \"not compatible with UK variant\" group of COVID-19 where the virus level is high enough to identify this. Which of these types of COVID-19 are compatible with these variants cannot be identified from the swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test alone. You can read more about the UK variant in our blog.\nSince 24 December 2020, we have reported on the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant that was identified in mid-November 2020. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying technical dataset.\nWe will continue to monitor the trends in different variants over the coming weeks. We will reintroduce charts into the bulletin if there is a variant that we can identify using our test that appears to be affecting the trends in the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19. \nThe percentage of people testing positive that are compatible with the UK variant decreased in England and Scotland in the week ending 24 April 2021. In the same week, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive that are compatible with the UK variant was uncertain in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the technical dataset that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus's genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30) - this is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in Office for National Statistics (ONS) data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher). Where we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which virus is which type of variant.\nThese data are provided in the accompanying technical dataset using the international standard labels. For example, the UK variant is B.1.1.7, and the South African variant is B.1.351. We have not seen any of the Manaus variant to date (P.1). We also provide information on viruses where we have found a particular genetic change (mutation) called E484K. This mutation is always seen in the South African variant (B.1.351). Laboratory data suggest that this mutation might make it easier for a virus to infect someone again, or to infect someone who has been vaccinated but the importance of this is still uncertain.\nThis analysis was produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2013 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our methods article and our recent blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 30 April 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 30 April 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 30 April 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 30 April 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 30 April 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on\u00a0sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0methods article\u00a0and our recent\u00a0blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

It should be noted that the analysis on the characteristics and behaviours of those testing positive in this article is for a different time period than the headline figures presented in the most recent bulletin. The reference periods for the various analyses are clearly stated at the start of each section.\nFurther information on what the analysis covers is provided at the start of each section. More information about the methods used for our models is available in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThis section looks at the likelihood of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) from nose and throat swabs by work location and mode of travel to work, as well as ability to socially distance at work. This analysis is based on data from UK survey participants aged 16 to 74 years who are currently working and were tested at any point between 3 October 2020 and 16 April 2021.\nEstimates are calculated using a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model accounts\u00a0for age, sex, region, urban or rural status, ethnicity, household size, multigenerational households, deprivation, whether individuals are currently working from home and their ability to socially distance at work if not working from home, method of travel to work and face coverings\u00a0in the workplace.\u00a0For more information on the methods used in this analysis, please see Section 8: Data sources and quality.\nIt is important to note that when attributing risk to working outside of the household, a broader range of factors beyond the mode of travel and ability to socially distance must also be considered to reflect the complexity of risk. Work-related risks are interlinked with a wide variety of other factors such as household size, socio-economic status and existing co-morbidities. The general contact individuals have with others both inside and outside of work will also contribute to their likelihood of testing positive. Transmission is therefore complex, and caution must be applied in over-simplifying the findings. Evidence from a range of studies needs to be synthesised to understand the complexity of transmission. This analysis is a contribution to the important and growing understanding of risks associated with testing positive for COVID-19. These findings build upon previously published analysis on the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 by occupation.\nResults are presented as odds ratios. When a characteristic (for example, travelling to work by car or taxi) has an odds ratio of one, this means that there is neither an increase nor a decrease in the likelihood of infection compared with a reference category (for example, working from home). An odds ratio of more than one means that there is an increased likelihood of infection compared with the reference category. An odds ratio of lower than one means that there is a reduced likelihood of infection compared with the reference category. For the purpose of this analysis, the models always show the likelihood of individuals working outside the home testing positive for COVID-19 compared with individuals working from home.\nThe odds ratios are presented with 95%\u00a0confidence intervals. If the range of the confidence interval crosses the threshold of one, we cannot say with any certainty whether infection is more or less likely for that characteristic compared with the reference category, even if the estimate is not close to one. In some instances, this will be because we estimate there to be no differences (where the odds ratio estimate is close to one), but it can also reflect less information about a characteristic in our sample meaning greater uncertainty as to whether the observed effect could just be due to chance.\nFigure 1 presents analysis that considers the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 according to mode of transport used to travel to work (car/taxi, train/bus and foot/bike/other) for those working outside the home, compared with individuals who work from home.\nBetween the end of November 2020 and the middle of February 2021, people who travelled to work were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than those working from home, regardless of mode of travel. There is limited evidence that those who travelled on foot, by bike or \"other\" means were less likely to test positive than those who travelled to work by train, bus, car or taxi, but this finding is less certain as confidence intervals are wide.\u00a0However, there was no evidence that the likelihood of testing positive differed between people travelling to work by train or bus, compared with those travelling to work by car or taxi.\nIt is important to note that a broad range of factors including the general contact individuals have with others both in and out of work will contribute to their likelihood of testing positive. Transmission is therefore complex, and caution must be applied in over-simplifying the findings.\nAny potential effects are far weaker in the last 28 days considered (up to 16 April 2021), or for the first 28 days (up to 30 October 2020) for those travelling by foot or bike or other. In the most recent period this may be because the uncertainty in the model estimate is greater because of lower numbers of positives.\nOdds ratios of individuals who travelled to work testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on a swab test compared with individuals working from home by mode of travel, UK, 3 October 2020 to 16 April 2021\nData download\nFigure 2 presents analysis that considers the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 for individuals who work outside of the home compared with those who work from home, by self-reported ability to socially distance at work. This analysis also adjusts for how individuals working outside the home travel to work.\nFor those working outside the home, there is evidence that the more difficult it is to maintain social distancing, the more likely they are to test positive for COVID-19. Those who reported that maintaining social distancing at work was easy had the same likelihood of testing positive as those working from home, while those who reported that maintaining social distancing at work was very difficult were more likely to test positive in four months out of the seven considered.\nOdds ratios of individuals who work outside the home testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on a swab test compared with individuals working from home by ability to socially distance, UK, 3 October 2020 to 16 April 2021\nData download\nResults show that a broad range of factors beyond the mode of travel and ability to socially distance must also be considered to reflect the complexity of risk of transmission. Therefore, although Figure 1 and Figure 2 suggest that work location, mode of travel to work, and ability to socially distance at work were all associated with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19, positivity is associated with a wider range of human and environmental factors.\nThis section looks at each person who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) who had a strong positive test. The strength of the test is determined by how quickly the virus is detected, measured by a cycle threshold (Ct) value. The lower the Ct value, the higher the viral load and stronger the positive test. Positive results with a high Ct value can be seen in the early stages of infection when virus levels are rising, or late in the infection, when the risk of transmission is low.\nParticipants who only have positive tests with these high values are excluded from this analysis to exclude the possibility that symptoms are not identified because we pick up individuals very early or later on in their infection. You can find\u00a0more information on Ct values\u00a0in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\nThis analysis considers individuals with any positive test (including repeated positive tests) that had a Ct value less than 30 between 1 December 2020 and 4 April 2021. This analysis considers all symptoms reported at visits within 35 days of the first positive test of the episode, and at each visit we ask about symptoms in the last seven days. This includes symptoms reported even when there is a negative test within this timeframe or a positive test with a higher Ct value. The methodology has changed since this analysis was last published. More details on the method used can be found in Section 8.\u00a0\nIndividuals taking part in the survey were asked at each visit whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms1\u00a0in the seven days before they were tested and also separately whether they felt that they had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection in the last seven days.\nIn Figure 4 we have categorised reported symptoms into the following:\nany: any specific self-reported symptom, including cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste, loss of smell, myalgia, fatigue, sore throat, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting\nclassic: cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste or loss of smell\ngastrointestinal (GI): abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhoea\nloss of taste or smell only\nIn England, 57.7% (95% confidence interval: 56.5% to 58.8%) of people who tested positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test between 1 December 2020 and 4 April 2021 reported having one or more symptoms1.\nIn Wales, 63.3% (95% confidence interval: 57.1% to 69.2%) of people who tested positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test between 1 December 2020 and 4 April 2021 reported having one or more symptoms1.\u00a0\nIn Northern Ireland, 48.4% (95% confidence interval: 41.1% to 55.8%) of people who tested positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test between 1 December 2020 and 4 April 2021 reported having one or more symptoms1.\u00a0\nIn Scotland, 55.3% (95% confidence interval: 49.7% to 60.8%) of people who tested positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test between 1 December 2020 and 4 April 2021 reported having one or more symptoms1.\u00a0\nOver half the people who tested positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test reported having one or more symptoms within 35 days of the test in England, Wales and Scotland. Across all four UK countries, people who tested positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test were more likely to report \"classic\" symptoms than gastrointestinal or loss of taste or smell only.\nPercentage of people with symptoms, including only those who have strong positive tests (Ct less than 30), UK countries, 1 December 2020 to 4 April 2021\nData download\nPercentage of people with symptoms, including only those who have strong positive tests (Ct less than 30), UK countries, 1 December 2020 to 4 April 2021\nData download\nFigure 5 shows that cough, fatigue and headache were the most common symptoms reported in strong positive COVID-19 cases across the four UK countries.

In each period the first positive test is taken or the latest negative if all tests in the interval are negative, together with the work factors reported at that visit.\u00a0It\u00a0excludes all individuals who are not currently working. Students, furloughed individuals and those on long-term leave are not included.\nEstimates are calculated using a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model accounts\u00a0for age, sex, region, urban or rural status, ethnicity, household size, multigenerational households, deprivation, whether individuals are currently working from home and their ability to socially distance at work if not working from home, method of travel to work and face coverings\u00a0in workplace.\u00a0Because this analysis is estimating the effects of these factors and adjusting for these other remaining factors, the data are unweighted.\nResults are presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The odds ratio analyses in this article uses \"working from home\" as a reference category, so odds ratios should be interpreted as giving the odds relative to someone who works from home.\u00a0\nThe two analyses are connected. How\u00a0easy it is to socially distance at work is adjusted\u00a0for in the model showing how likely it is to test positive by mode of\u00a0transport\u00a0to work, and vice versa.\u00a0Because the analyses are connected, the\u00a0odds ratios\u00a0can be multiplied together. For example, the likelihood of testing positive\u00a0if\u00a0you travel by\u00a0bus or train and\u00a0find it\u00a0very difficult to distance at work is found\u00a0by multiplying the likelihood for \"travel by bus or train\" by the likelihood for\u00a0\"distancing very difficult\".\nThe analysis on the symptoms profile of strong positive cases for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland considers individuals with any positive test (including repeated positive tests) that had a Ct value less than 30 between 1 December 2020 and 4 April 2021. Positive episodes are now being defined as \"a new positive test 90 days or more after an initial first positive test and following a previous negative test, or, if within 90 days, a subsequent positive test following four consecutive negative tests\", rather than using a 90-day threshold alone. As a part of implementing this improvement we identified some coding issues which have now been resolved. This affects some of our previously reported estimates but does not affect the main trends. Therefore, the estimates presented today supersede our previous estimates.\n", "summary": "Travelling to work and struggling to maintain social distancing increased the odds of testing positive for COVID-19, but cannot be assumed to be the only causes of spread\nTransmission of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is a complex continuous risk, which can occur in any setting. Work location, mode of travel to work, and ability to socially distance at work were all associated with the likelihood of testing positive. However, these factors alone cannot be assumed to be the only cause of the spread of the virus.\nBetween the end of November 2020 and the middle of February 2021, people who travelled to work were more likely to test positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) than those working from home, regardless of mode of travel.\nThere is limited evidence that those who travelled on foot, by bike or \u201cother\u201d means were less likely to test positive than those who travelled to work by train, bus, car or taxi but this finding is less certain as confidence intervals are wide. For those working outside the home, there is evidence that the more difficult it is to maintain social distancing, the more likely they are to test positive for COVID-19.\nBetween 1 December 2020 and 4 April 2021, over half of those who tested positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test reported having some symptoms within 35 days of the test in England, Wales and Scotland; just under half reported symptoms in Northern Ireland.\nCough, fatigue, and headache were the most common symptoms reported in strong positive COVID-19 cases across the four UK countries.\n", "id": 428}, {"document": "While the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been greatest for younger workers, older workers aged 50 years and over have\u00a0been affected to a greater extent than those in the middle age groups.\u00a0\nIn December 2020 to February 2021, those employees aged 50 years and over were more likely to report working fewer hours than usual (including none) in the past week because of the coronavirus than those aged under 50 years, with those aged 65 years and over the most likely to say they had worked reduced hours.\nOver a quarter of furloughed employments are people aged 50 years and over (1.3\u00a0million), \u00a0with 3\u00a0in 10 of older workers on furlough thinking there is\u00a0a 50% chance or higher that they will lose their job\u00a0when the scheme ends.\u00a0\nOlder people who become unemployed are more likely to be at risk of long-term unemployment than younger people.\nThose aged 50 years and over make up an increasing proportion of the workforce in the UK. Prior to the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, in 2019, almost a third of workers were aged 50 years and over.\nThe pandemic has had a marked impact on the labour market overall and working lives. Having previously explored the impact of the coronavirus on younger workers, in this article we look at its impact on older workers.\nOlder workers are a very diverse group, in terms of age, sex, working patterns, employment type and industry.\nIn 2019, prior to the start of the pandemic, 72.3% people aged 50 to 64 years were in employment, 2.0% were unemployed1 and 25.7% were economically inactive. While the proportion of older people in work declines with age, 1 in 10 people aged 65 years and over were still working.\nOlder workers are far more likely to be self-employed than younger workers, with self-employment increasing with age and men being more likely to be self-employed than women in all older age groups.\nFor workers aged 50 years and over, men are most likely to be working in manufacturing, construction, and wholesale, retail and repair of motor vehicles, while for older women workers, the most common industries are health and social work, education, and wholesale, retail and repair of motor vehicles. \nThe impact of the coronavirus on older workers will have varied according to their different characteristics, leading to different experiences of the pandemic. \n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

Find out how we are working safely in our studies and surveys.  \n\n\n1 This is the percentage of people aged 50 to 64 years who were unemployed in 2019, not the unemployment rate, which is calculated as a proportion of those economically active.\nAcross almost all ages, employment rates have decreased, while unemployment rates and economic inactivity rates have increased over the period of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Workers in the youngest age groups (16 to 24 years) have been the worst affected compared with other ages. While the impact of the pandemic has been greatest for younger workers, older workers have been affected to a greater extent than middle-age groups.\nThe seasonally adjusted employment rate for those aged 50 to 64 years fell from 72.6 to 71.1%, and for those aged 65 years and over fell from 11.5 to 10.4%, with broadly similar changes in employment rates seen for older men and women.\nThere was a decline in the number of those employed aged 50 to 64 years over the year December 2020 to February 2021, despite an increase in the population aged 50 years and over in this period. This decline was driven by those aged 50 to 54 years and 65 years and over.\nThe proportion self-employed among older workers (50 years and over) fell by 2.0% over the period to 19.4%, with a corresponding increase in proportion who were employees to 80.0%1. Employment status is self-reported, some of this change has been driven by an increase in workers who have changed their self-classification from self-employed to employed even though they have not changed jobs.\nThe fall in the number of self-employed aged 50 years and over was larger than the gain in the number of employees, leading to an overall seasonally adjusted net loss of 193,000 older workers (down from 10.7 to 10.5 million).\nThe pandemic has impacted the weekly average hours worked for all ages.\nIn December 2020 to February 2021, those employees aged 50 years and over were more likely to report working fewer hours than usual (including none) in the past week because of the coronavirus than those aged under 50 years, with those 65 years and over the most likely to say they had worked reduced hours.\nAmong older employees working reduced hours, the 65 years and overs were the most likely to receive no pay and the least likely to receive full pay.\nOlder women employees were more likely to have reduced their hours because of the impact of the coronavirus than men (14.8% of women compared with 12.1% of men).\nGiven that relatively high proportions of older people are self-employed this is likely to be an underestimation of reduction in working hours amongst older workers because of the coronavirus. There is evidence that those aged 50 years and over who are self-employed were more likely to have seen a reduction in hours than employees between January 2020 and January 2021 (Understanding Society: COVID-19 Study, Wave 7).\nThe government introduced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) (furlough) at the beginning of lockdown in March 2020 to support employers in paying their employees during the coronavirus pandemic. This will now continue until 30 September 2021.\n\n\nFigure 5: Furlough rates have been highest at the youngest ages, but also pick up at older ages\nFurlough take up rate under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme at 28 February 2021, by sex and age group, UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: HM Revenue and Customs - Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) Statistics: March 2021\n\nNotes:\n\nAge has been calculated as at 1 November 2020.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 5: Furlough rates have been highest at the youngest ages, but also pick up at older ages\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThere are 4.7 million furloughed employments (February 2021) with 27.9%\u00a0(1.3\u00a0million) of these being aged 50 years and over. While the youngest employees have the highest take-up rates there is also an small upward trend at the oldest ages.\nSome furloughs may end in redundancy when the scheme ends. This may present more challenges for older people who, once they become unemployed, are more likely to be unemployed long-term than younger people; 3 in 10 of those aged 50 years and over on furlough think there is a 50% chance or more that they will lose their job when the furlough scheme ends (Understanding Society: COVID-19 Study Wave 4).\nThe government also set up an Income Support Scheme (SEISS) for those who are self-employed and whose trade has been adversely affected by the pandemic. This is of particular relevance to older workers, as a greater proportion are self-employed compared with younger workers. For each of the SEISS grants to date the take-up rates for self-employed workers aged 55 to 64 years have been around the same as other age groups but those aged 65 years and over have had the lowest take-up rates of all age groups although they have had the highest average claim values.\u00a0\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for those aged 50 to 64 years increased from 3.0% in December 2019 to February 2020 to 4.1% in December 2020 to February 2021, with rates consistently higher for older men than women. The number unemployed in this age group increased by 109,000, to 394,000.\nRedundancy rates increased sharply across all ages following the onset of the pandemic, peaking at 14.2 per thousand in September to November 2020 before declining to 7.3 per thousand in December 2020 to February 2021. The pattern varied by age, with redundancy rates increasing first for those aged 16 to 24 years and also declining first for this age group.\nThose aged 50 years and over had the highest overall increase in redundancy rate over the year to December 2020 to February 2021, rising from 4.3 to 9.7 per thousand, up 5.4 per thousand on the year. This was the highest redundancy rate across age groups in the latest quarter.\nOver a quarter of redundancies for men aged 50 years and over during the period of the pandemic were in manufacturing (one of the most common industries for older men to be working in). Around one-fifth of redundancies for men were in distribution, hotels and restaurants and a further fifth in banking and finance. Construction, which is the second most common industry for older men to work in had fewer redundancies at 8% of older male redundancies.\nAround one-third of all redundancies for women aged 50 years and over were in distribution, hotels and restaurants, significantly higher than any other industry. Redundancies were also relatively high in banking and finance, accounting for around 1 in 5 redundancies, in manufacturing, and in public administration, education and health, each accounting for around 14% of redundancies for older female workers.\nThose aged 50 years and over are more likely to be long term unemployed (for 12 months or more) than younger age groups. In December 2020 to February 2021, 29.9% of unemployed 50 years and overs were long-term unemployed compared with 18.9% of those aged under 50 years (seasonally adjusted). Previous research has shown that the more time spent out of work, the less likely someone is to return to employment and the likelihood of returning to work decreases with age.\nThe seasonally adjusted economic inactivity rate of people aged 50 to 64 years increased from 25.2% to 25.9% between December 2019 to February 2020 and December 2020 to February 2021, the number of people increasing by 131,000, from 3.2 to 3.4 million. This increase has been\u00a0primarily driven by increased\u00a0inactivity rates at ages 50 to 54 years, the age group also primarily accounting for the drop in employment levels among older people.\nAmong those older people economically inactive who were not looking for work in December 2019 to February 2020 but said they would like to work, 2.3% said this was because they believed there were not jobs available at that time. A year later this had risen to 5.3%.\n1 The proportion of workers who are employees and self-employed do not add up to 100 because of the inclusion of people on government schemes and unpaid family workers.\nDownload the data\nPre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, most employment occurred in the workplace with relatively low levels of working from home. As a result of the pandemic, working from home has become the norm where it is possible. However, in those industries that are most common for older people to work in, levels of working from home are still low with only very small increases over the period of the pandemic.\nThe exception to this is professional, technical and scientific activities, where working from home has increased sharply. Around a third\u00a0of\u00a0both men and women who worked in this industry\u00a0predominantly\u00a0worked from\u00a0home by late 2020, an increase of\u200b approximately 10 percentage points.\n\n\nFigure 9: Older workers with higher socio-economic classification were more likely to work from home\nPercentage of workers aged 50 years and over by frequency of working from home by NS-SEC classification, both sexes, UK, January 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Understanding Society, Covid module Wave 7\n\nNotes:\n\nThe percentage for often working from home among lower supervisory and technical workers is based on a small sample size and should be used with caution.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 9: Older workers with higher socio-economic classification were more likely to work from home\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, older workers with higher qualifications and in the managerial and professional socio-economic classification (NS-SEC) were the most likely to be working from home. Self-employed older workers were more likely to be working from home than employees; 8 in 10 older people working from home reported the same or increased productivity (compared with 7 in 10 aged under 50 years). The most common reasons older workers gave for reporting increased productivity were being interrupted\u00a0less and not having to commute \u200b(Understanding Society: COVID-19 Study, Wave 7).\nChanges to working lives brought on by the pandemic have negatively impacted the life satisfaction of some workers aged 50 years and over.\u200b Unemployed older people have lower levels of life satisfaction than older workers who have been furloughed or are not currently working, while those working have the highest life satisfaction.\u200b\nAmong those who are working, very high life satisfaction is equally likely for older workers who live alone as for those living with others. However, for those currently not working, those who live alone are less likely to have very high life satisfaction than those who live with others. Those living alone who have been made redundant, are on furlough or are unable to carry out their self-employment trade, have all lost the opportunity for daily workplace interactions.\nAmong those who are working, life satisfaction is higher for older workers who are not working from home compared with those who are working entirely from home. Again, this may be because of the opportunity they have for face-to-face social interactions in the workplace (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: COVID-19 Study, Wave 1).\nWhile two-thirds of workers aged 50 years and over feel there is a no chance of losing their employment in the next three months, a substantial minority feel their job is at some risk, with 12.5% feeling there is 50% chance or higher\u00a0of\u00a0losing their employment.\nOf self-employed older workers, 76.1% say there is no chance of losing their employment in the next three months compared with 66.0% of employees This may be related to perceived higher levels of control over their\u00a0employment and job autonomy\u200b.\u200b\nOlder employees who have not been furloughed feel more secure in their jobs than those who have been furloughed, with around two-thirds saying there is no chance of losing their job compared with less than half of those who have been furloughed.\nWhile the majority of older workers think they will not struggle to pay bills and expenses in the next three months, 1 in 12 think there is 50% chance or higher of struggling financially. Those who have been furloughed and those with a health condition are significantly more likely to feel uncertain about their financial security (Analysis based on data from Understanding Society: COVID-19 Study, Waves 4 and 6).\nAs a result of the pandemic, 1 in 8 (13%) of workers aged 50 years and over say they have changed their retirement plans, with 5% saying that they will retire earlier and 8% planning to retire later.\nOlder workers on paid or unpaid leave from employment, including furlough, were the most likely to say they have changed their retirement plans but were almost equally likely to say they were planning to retire earlier (10%) or later (9%).\nUncertainty around current employment and future employment prospects may have resulted in some older workers feeling they have to work longer than planned to achieve financial security in retirement; for others the uncertainty could have resulted in planning to retire earlier. This may particularly be the case for those nearing retirement age.\nThose who have been working from home were more likely to say they were planning to retire later (11%) compared with those not working from home (5%). This may be because some of the benefits of homeworking (and the possibility of continuing to do so) have made the prospect of continuing to work into later ages more feasible. This option is more likely to be available to those working in managerial and professional occupations (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: COVID-19 Study, Wave 1).\nThe Office for National Statistics is publishing more data and analysis than ever before.

As the current projections are 2018-based they are based on demographic trends that pre-date the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We are analysing the population totals used in the weighting process and intend to make adjustments where appropriate. Rates published from the LFS remain robust; however, levels and changes in levels should be used with caution.\nUnless otherwise stated, LFS data presented in this article are not seasonally adjusted, and may not match figures published in official labour market releases which use seasonally adjusted data.\nAll analysis is at UK level except analysis from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, which covers England only. \n", "summary": "Those aged 50 years and over most likely to be facing redundancy\nThose aged 50 years and over had the highest redundancy rate across all age groups in the latest quarter (December 2020 to February 2021), with 9.7 per thousand within this age group being affected. This figure is up from 4.3 per thousand last year.\nOver a quarter of redundancies for older male workers over the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were in manufacturing, while construction (the second most common industry for older men) had fewer redundancies at 8%. Around one-third of all redundancies for older female workers were in distribution, hotels and restaurants.\nIn the latest quarter, 29.9% of those unemployed and aged 50 years and over were in long-term unemployment, compared with 18.9% under 50 years.\nIn the same period, employees aged 50 years and over were more likely than those aged under 50 years to report working fewer hours than usual due to the coronavirus.\n", "id": 432}, {"document": "In England, the percentage of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) has continued to decrease in the week ending 2 May 2021; we estimate that 46,100 people within the community population in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 36,300 to 56,900), equating to around 1 in 1,180 people.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in the most recent two weeks up to 2 May 2021; we estimate that 1,500 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 400 to 3,400), equating to around 1 in 2,070 people.\nIn Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive has remained level in the two weeks up to 2 May 2021; we estimate that 2,400 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 900 to 5,000), equating to around 1 in 750 people.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has continued to decrease in the week ending 2 May 2021; we estimate that 6,900 people in Scotland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 3,600 to 11,600) equating to around 1 in 760 people.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In institutional settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 can be found in our latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period.\nAll analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nEarly management information from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey is\u00a0made available to government decision-makers to inform their response to COVID-19. Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad-hoc or early publications as soon as possible.

In the most recent two weeks up to 2 May 2021, the number of people testing positive in Wales decreased and the trend appeared level in Northern Ireland.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 10. Because of lower positivity rates caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales and Northern Ireland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs from 3 May 2020\nDownload the data\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. Information about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our methods article.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 2 May 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive was observed in Yorkshire and The Humber, although rates were low in all regions and credible intervals are wide.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 2 May 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in all regions except in Yorkshire and The Humber, the East of England and London. In the East of England, the trend is uncertain in the week ending 2 May 2021, but the percentage testing positive decreased in the most recent two weeks. The trend is uncertain in Yorkshire and The Humber and London.

Because of this low positivity, we are not providing sub-regional positivity estimates for the four countries.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year olds have been split between the youngest age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying\u00a0datasets. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 2 May 2021, the percentage of people testing positive continued to decrease in those aged 2 years to School Year 11. In the two weeks up to 2 May 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased for those aged 35 to 69 years, but the trend is uncertain in the most recent week. In the week ending 2 May 2021, the trend is uncertain for all other age groups. However, the percentage testing positive for those aged 70 years and over is very low. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trend.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on nose and throat swabs, daily, by age group since 22 March 2021, England\nDownload the data\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 3 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our datasets and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nEstimates of the incidence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases are produced using a method based on our positivity estimate. This gives the rate at which new positives occur, and subsequently become detectable, within the population.\nThis incidence method uses an estimate of the length of time for which an individual will test positive, based on modelling the time from first positive to first subsequent negative test in the survey. This estimate is used alongside the positivity model to produce an estimate. This method is robust to participants having monthly swabs. For more information on the incidence method, see our\u00a0methods article.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 10 days prior to the end of the positivity reference week. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data.\nEstimates are included for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nIn the week ending 25 April 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases appeared level in Wales and Northern Ireland, but uncertainty was high. In the week ending 25 April 2021, the trend in the number of new PCR-positive cases was uncertain in England and Scotland.\nFor estimates of incidence in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, credible intervals are wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results. In particular, when prevalence is very low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances, we will consider providing the upper bound of the credible interval.\nFigure 4 presents the official incidence estimates for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland for the week ending 25 April 2021. Modelled estimates for the most recent five weeks are also provided for each of the four countries.\nEstimated numbers of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in the UK, based on nose and throat swabs with modelled estimates from 22 March 2021\nNotes:\nDownload the data\nThe incidence rate measures the occurrence of new PCR-positive cases of COVID-19, and the calculation of this is defined in\u00a0Section 10: Glossary. The incidence rate is not the same as the reproduction rate (R), which is the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected person.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The UK variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes that coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the UK variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Other variants, including B.1.525 (first identified in Nigeria), also have this same pattern of gene positivity. At present these are\u00a0rare in the UK\u00a0so we continue to describe this group as compatible with the UK variant, but we will continue to keep this under review. You can\u00a0read more about the UK variant\u00a0in our blog. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying\u00a0technical dataset.\nThe trend in the percentage of people testing positive that are compatible with the UK variant was uncertain in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in the week ending 2 May 2021.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"cycle threshold\", known as a\u00a0Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0technical dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nBecause of the bank holiday, we have been unable to update our genetic lineages data this week.\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on\u00a0sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0methods article\u00a0and our recent\u00a0blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 7 May 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

The services sector is now 7.2% below pre-pandemic level (February 2020) and 2.2% below its initial recovery peak (October 2020). \nThe production sector grew for a second consecutive month in March 2021, by 1.8%, following growth of 1.0% in February 2020. The production sector is now 1.8% below its February 2020 level. The construction sector saw growth of 5.8% in March 2021, driven by both new work and repair and maintenance. The construction sector is now 2.4% above its February 2020 level.\nRevisions to headline GDP in January and February 2021 were mainly because of revisions to human health and social work activities (see Section 3); with January\u2019s headline GDP growth downwardly revised to negative 2.5% from negative 2.2%, and February\u2019s headline GDP growth upwardly revised to 0.7% from 0.4%. \nOverall, GDP contracted by 1.5% in the three months to March 2021, compared with a downwardly revised 1.7% contraction in the three months to February 2021. More details on Quarterly growth can be found in the First Quarterly Estimate publication.\nServices output grew by 1.9% in March 2021 but remains 7.2% below its pre-pandemic level of February 2020. \nFigure 3 shows education output as the main contributor to services growth in March 2021, as schools began to re-open in England (from 8 March) and Wales (from 15 March). However, despite this growth, education output in March 2021 remained 3.9% below its December 2020 level, when schools were last fully open before the latest COVID-19 restrictions were introduced across the UK. Wholesale and retail trade was the second largest contributor to services output as retail sales continued to show strength, growing 2.9%.\n\n!\n\nDifferences in the methods for estimating the output of health and education services across different countries mean GDP may be less internationally comparable during the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery than usual, so should be made with increased caution. \n\n\n\nOutput in human health and social work activities grew 1.7% in March 2021, following revised growth of 0.7% in February and negative 0.7% in January. This gradual pick up in health in the first three months of 2021 is driven by coronavirus testing and tracing and vaccine schemes across the UK. Adjustments have been made to reflect the testing and tracing and vaccine programmes. More information is available in Section 8: Measuring the data.\nOverall, service sector growth for January 2021 was downwardly revised to negative 2.9% (from negative 2.5%), while growth for February 2021 was upwardly revised to 0.6% (from 0.2%). Revisions were mainly because of the health sector; with growth in health output for January revised down to negative 0.7% (from positive 5.9%), and growth for February revised up to 0.7% (from negative 2.7%). A contraction in output of the health industry (excluding test and tracing and vaccine schemes) has contributed to the weakness in January 2021 as planned health activities were delayed because of precautions undertaken as a result of the surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations. \nServices output contracted by 2.0% in the three months to March 2021. This was driven by decreases in in education services and wholesale and retail trade, partly offset by growth in human health and social work activities.\nProduction grew by 1.8% in March 2021 with growth in three out of the four sub-sectors. This is the fastest growth in production since July 2020, when it grew 5.6%. \nThe manufacturing sub-sector was the largest contributor to growth, growing 2.1%, its fastest pace since July 2020 when it grew 7.4%. Eleven out of the thirteen manufacturing sub-sectors grew with the largest positive contribution coming from the manufacturing of machinery and equipment (which grew by 8.3%) and manufacturing of computer, electronic and optical products (which grew by 5.5%).\nMining and quarrying output grew by 2.5% in March 2021 following two months of contraction; mainly because of the extraction of oil and gas picking up. \nOutput in the production sector fell by 0.4% in the three months to March 2021, driven by the large fall in manufacturing in January 2021 amidst tightened coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. \nConstruction output grew by 5.8% in March 2021, with rising demand and good weather cited as contributing factors. This is the fastest growth in construction since July 2020, when it grew 17.8%. \nConstruction growth in March 2021 was driven by both a rise in repair and maintenance (4.4%) and in new work (6.7%). Further detail on the contributions to construction growth can be found in Construction output in Great Britain: March 2021.\nGrowth to construction for January and February 2021 have been upwardly revised to 0.4% (up by 0.4 percentage points) and 2.3% (up by 0.7 percentage points) respectively, mainly because of late survey returns. \nThe construction sector expanded by 2.6% in the three months to March 2021. The main contributors in new work were infrastructure and private new housing which grew by 4.3% and 2.7% respectively, while the main driver in repair and maintenance was non-housing repair and maintenance which grew 3.2%.\n\nMonthly gross domestic product by gross value added  Dataset | Released 12 May 2021 The gross value added (GVA) tables showing the monthly and annual growths and indices as published within the monthly gross domestic product (GDP) statistical bulletin.Contributions to monthly GDP Dataset | Released 12 May 2021 Contributions to growth within monthly gross domestic product (GDP), UK.Monthly gross domestic product: time series Dataset | Dataset ID: MGDP | Released 12 May 2021 Monthly estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) containing constant price gross value added (GVA) data for the UK.Monthly GDP and main sectors to four decimal places Dataset | Released 12 May 2021 Monthly index values for monthly gross domestic product (GDP) and the main sectors in the UK to four decimal places.Revisions triangles for monthly GDP Dataset | Released 12 May 2021 Comparison of gross domestic product (GDP) first estimates against estimates published later. \n\n\n", "summary": "The economy grew by 2.1% in March 2021\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by 2.1% in March 2021, the fastest monthly growth since August 2020, as schools in some parts of the UK reopened throughout the month.\nThe output approach to GDP shows that March\u2019s level is 5.9% below the levels seen in February 2020, and 1.1% below the initial recovery peak in October 2020.\nGross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 1.5% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020, following 1.3% growth in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020.\nThe service sector grew by 1.9% in March 2021, with schools re-opening across England and Wales and retail trade sales continuing to show strength.

Equivalent to a provisional age-standardised rate of 13.0 deaths per 100,000 people, the alcohol-specific death rate in 2020 represents a statistically significant rise of 18.2% from the rate (11.0 deaths per 100,000) in 2019.\nBetween 2001 and 2019, the number of alcohol-specific deaths increased by an average of 2.1% each year which is equivalent to an average annual increase of 1.2% in the alcohol-specific death rate over the same period. The rise seen in 2020 is greater than any other year since 2001.\n\n!\n\nAlcohol-specific deaths only include those health conditions where each death is a direct consequence of alcohol misuse (that is, wholly-attributable causes such as alcoholic liver disease). See Section 8. Measuring the data for more information. \n\n\n\nConsistent with previous years, the alcohol-specific death rate for males in 2020 (17.6 deaths per 100,000 males; 4,891 deaths) was around twice the rate for females (8.7 deaths per 100,000 females; 2,532 deaths).\nThe National Statistics definition of alcohol-specific deaths includes only those health conditions where each death was a direct consequence of alcohol misuse (that is, wholly-attributable deaths). Most of these are chronic (longer-term) conditions associated with continued misuse of alcohol. Therefore, the increase in deaths in 2020 is more likely to be attributed to those with previous history of alcohol misuse or dependency.\nRates of alcohol-specific deaths have statistically significantly increased since the second quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Quarters 2 (Apr to June) and 3 (July to Sept) 2020 both saw provisional rates of 12.8 alcohol-specific deaths per 100,000 people, and with 13.6 deaths per 100,000 population, Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 saw the highest recorded rate of any quarter since 2001. All of these rates were statistically significantly higher than the respective periods in 2019.\nThe difference in rates of alcohol-specific deaths between 2019 and 2020 has grown larger with each quarter. The rate in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020 was 8.5% higher than the same period in 2019; in Quarter 2 2020 the rate was 17.4% higher; in Quarter 3 2020 the rate was 21.9% higher; and in Quarter 4 2020 the rate was 28.3% higher.\nSince 2001, rates of alcohol-specific deaths in England and Wales have generally been higher in the first quarter of each year. As such, while there were 12.8 alcohol-specific deaths per 100,000 in Quarter 1 2020, this was not statistically significantly different to the rate seen for that period in 2019.\nFigures for England tend to follow a similar pattern to that of England and Wales combined, with quarterly rates ranging between 12.6 and 13.6 deaths per 100,000 people in 2020. Compared with the same period in 2019, rates were statistically significantly higher in England in Quarters 2, 3 and 4 2020.\nAs shown in Figure 3, alcohol-specific rates for Wales increased to 15.7 deaths per 100,000 in Quarter 1 2020 before declining in subsequent quarters. Rates for Wales by quarter have not changed in recent years in terms of statistical significance; because of the smaller number of registered deaths, Wales tends to have a more volatile pattern than England. \u00a0\nWhen comparing quarterly rates for the English regions in 2020 with the corresponding quarter in 2019 there were significant increases in the North East and London in Quarter 2 2020, in the South West in Quarter 3 2020, and in the North West, West Midlands and South East in Quarter 4 2020.\nRates for persons are presented in Figure 3, though caution is recommended when directly comparing regional rates; because of the relatively smaller number of deaths, rates for English regions by quarter of death registration have a wide degree of statistical uncertainty.\nDownload the data\nThis section looks at alcohol-specific death rates and how these differ among those living in the most deprived local areas versus the least deprived areas.\nThe Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is an overall measure of deprivation based on factors such as income, employment, health, education, crime, the living environment and access to housing within an area. There are different measurements for England and Wales, which are not directly comparable.\nIn previous years alcohol-specific deaths have disproportionately affected areas with higher levels of deprivation (see Figure 4). In 2019 the alcohol-specific death rate for males was 3.8 times higher in the most deprived quintile (Quintile 1; 29.1 deaths per 100,000) than in the least deprived quintile (Quintile 5; 7.6 deaths per 100,000), and for females the rate was 3.2 times higher in the most deprived quintile (12.6 deaths per 100,000) than in the least deprived quintile (3.9 deaths per 100,000).\nIn 2020 the relative difference between the most deprived and least deprived areas had increased for males and decreased for females. The rate for males was 4.2 times higher in the most deprived quintile (34.1 deaths per 100,000) compared with the least deprived quintile (8.1 deaths per 100,000), and the rate for females was 3.0 times higher in the most deprived quintile (15.0 deaths per 100,000) compared with the least deprived quintile (5.0 deaths per 100,000).\nFurther analysis for each quintile of deprivation is available in the accompanying dataset. Interestingly, those who lived in the fourth quintile of deprivation saw the largest increase between 2019 and 2020, with alcohol-specific death rates in this quintile increasing statistically significantly by 22.6% and by 34.0% in males and females, respectively.\nThe lower number of deaths in Wales makes it difficult to examine the relationship between deprivation and alcohol-specific deaths for single years. Instead looking at the five-year average (2015 to 2019 registrations), the overall relationship between deprivation and alcohol-specific deaths is the same as England with the highest rates in the most deprived areas (Quintile 1), and the lowest rates in the least deprived (Quintile 5).\nNone of the observed differences between rates by IMD in 2020 and the five-year average were statistically significant (Figure 5).\nWhen trying to understand the elevated rates of alcohol-specific deaths seen since April 2020, there will be many complex factors, and it may be some time before we fully understand all of these. \nData from Public Health England show that consumption patterns have changed since the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Alcohol consumption is a contributing factor to hospital admissions and death. \nFor further discussion see our previous release.\nThe accompanying dataset includes more data on alcohol-specific deaths by:\nAge group\nUnderlying cause of death\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) as a contributing cause of death\n\nQuarterly alcohol-specific deaths in England and Wales Dataset | Released 6 May 2021 Quarterly rates and numbers of deaths caused by diseases known to be a direct consequence of alcohol misuse.

The provisional estimates for the number and rate of alcohol-specific deaths in 2020 were the highest since records began in 2001.\nThe number of alcohol-specific deaths in 2020 was 19.6% higher than in 2019 (6,209 deaths; 11.0 per 100,000 people). This year-on-year increase was also a record \u2013 between 2001 and 2019, the number of alcohol-specific deaths increased by an average of 2.1% each year.\nWhen comparing the same quarter across the years, the rate of alcohol-specific deaths in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020 was statistically similar to rates in previous years. However, rates in Quarter 2 (Apr to June), Quarter 3 (July to Sept) and Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 \u2013 after the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic \u2013 were all statistically significantly higher than in any other year back to 2001.\nThe difference between 2019 and 2020 widened in each successive quarter; the age-standardised rate in 2020 was 8.5% higher in Quarter 1, 17.4% higher in Quarter 2, 21.9% higher in Quarter 3 and 28.3% higher in Quarter 4, than in the equivalent quarter of 2019.\nData from Public Health England show that a rise in consumption in older age groups is likely to have driven the rise in alcohol-specific deaths.\nAlcohol consumption in younger age groups has decreased significantly during the pandemic period, but this is not reflected in the death rate because of the relatively low chance of young people dying from alcohol-specific causes.\nConsistent with previous years, the alcohol-specific death rate for males in 2020 (17.6 deaths per 100,000 males; 4,891 deaths) was around twice the rate for females (8.7 deaths per 100,000 females; 2,532 deaths).\n", "id": 440}, {"document": "For the 12-month period to year ending December 2020:\nEstimates from the crime survey show that there were approximately 12 million offences;1 this estimate cannot be compared directly with previous periods because of the way the survey is currently conducted.\nTotal police recorded crime decreased by 8% to approximately 5.6 million offences, driven by falls during the periods of national lockdown, particularly April to June 2020 and mainly theft offences.\nThere was an 11% fall in offences involving firearms and 9% fall in offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime), driven by substantial decreases in the April to June 2020 period.\nThe number of homicides decreased by 12%, however, when the single incident that took place in Grays, Essex, in October 2019, when the bodies of 39 migrants were found in a lorry is excluded, homicides show a 6% decrease (625 offences). \nThere was a 15% increase in drug offences, driven by a large increase in April to June 2020, reflecting proactive police activity in crime hotspots.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and related lockdown restrictions have resulted in fluctuations in the level of crime in England and Wales, for example, for police recorded crime:\nTotal offences decreased by 7% between July to September 2020 and October to December 2020.\nComparing October to December 2020 with the same period the previous year, total offences were 9% lower (1.4 million), theft offences were 27% lower (354,746) and knife-enabled crime was 16% lower (11,041). \nCommenting on today\u2019s figures, Sophie Sanders from the Office for National Statistics Centre for Crime and Justice said:\n\u201cThere were fluctuations in the level of crime experienced in England and Wales throughout 2020. This is supported by findings from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey and police recorded crime data. Although a small proportion of these fluctuations will be the result of seasonal effects on crime trends, the majority can be attributed to the introduction and subsequent easing of national lockdown restrictions throughout the year. \n\u201cMost crime types have seen recorded offences fall year-on-year. The notable exceptions are drug offences, because of proactive police activity in crime hotspots during the first lockdown, while violence against the person also saw a small increase.\u201d\nTo improve data quality the Home Office and police forces have developed a new methodology for identifying recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime). Figures referenced in this section use data from the new methodology for the first time and are therefore not comparable with those in previous releases. \nThe new methodology requires police forces to run their record-level crime data through the National Data Quality Improvement Service (NDQIS) computer-assisted classification tool to identify crimes tagged as involving a knife or sharp instrument. Part of the implementation also involved changes to the coverage of the data collection. The tool was piloted with forces and shown to improve data quality and comparability.\nForces with the highest volumes of knife-enabled crime were prioritised for the roll-out, 12 forces have now switched to the NDQIS data collection methodology.1 In the year ending March 2020 these forces accounted for 64% of the offences recorded by the police across England and Wales that involved a knife or a sharp instrument. It is planned that the new methodology will be rolled out to all forces in England and Wales over the next year. Estimates in this release include a combination of both new and old data collection methods. \nFor more information including the differences in data collection methods, please see the methodology note Police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments, methodology changes and blog.\nThere were 12 million offences, including fraud and computer misuse, experienced by adults aged 18 years and over in the last 12 months to year ending December 2020.1 \nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and related lockdown restrictions have resulted in fluctuations in the level of crime experienced in England and Wales during 2020. As a result of the small Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) sample size, measuring change in incidence between quarterly periods is affected by increased uncertainty around repeat incidents. The number of offences remained similar between quarterly periods January to September 2020 while the number of victims of total crime including fraud and computer misuse fluctuated. \n\n!\n\nBecause of the change in data collection mode, there is a break in the CSEW data time series. TCSEW estimates are not directly comparable with those previously published from the face-to-face CSEW.\n\n\n\nFor the crime types and population it covers, the face-to-face Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a better indicator of long-term trends than police recorded crime. It is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police or police recording practices.\nSince the mid-1990s, there have been long-term falls seen in overall CSEW crime estimates. Long-term trends vary by crime types. For all headline figures, including a data time series, see Appendix tables.\nAlthough not directly comparable, TCSEW annual estimates of total crime are similar to levels estimated by the face-to-face CSEW in recent years. We plan to investigate and report on the impact of the mode change and sampling biases in our next publication. \nThe police recorded 5.6 million crimes in England and Wales in the 12-month period to year ending December 2020, an 8% decrease from the previous year. This reduction was apparent across all regions of England and in Wales with decreases of between 3% and 14% in police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse).\n\n!\n\nImprovements to recording processes and practices by the police, expansions of the recorded crime collection to include new offences, variations in police activity, more victims reporting crime, and genuine increases in some types of crime, have made substantial contributions to rises in recorded crime over the last five years. This effect has been more pronounced for some crime types, and for many types of offence, these figures do not provide reliable trends in crime.\n\n\n\nTheft offences fell by 26% in the year ending December 2020. There were falls in robbery offences (25% decrease), sexual offences (7% decrease) and criminal damage and arson (11% decrease) but there were rises in drug offences (15% increase) and a slight rise in violence against the person offences (2% increase). \nTrends in police recorded crime data for lower volume crimes (year ending December 2020) showed:\nthe number of homicides decreased by 12%; this fall was partly because of the single incident that took place in the previous year, October 2019, when the bodies of 39 migrants were found in a lorry in Grays, Essex; excluding this incident from the previous year\u2019s homicide count (from 707 to 668 offences), the number of homicides shows a 6% decrease in the year ending December 2020 (625 offences)\na 9% decrease in the number of offences involving knives or sharp instruments\nan 11% decrease in offences involving firearms\nTotal recorded crime, including fraud, has fluctuated over the year ending December 2020. Although a small proportion of these fluctuations will be the result of seasonal effects on crime trends, the majority can be attributed to the introduction and subsequent easing of national lockdown restrictions throughout the year. \n\n\nFigure 4: Falls in police recorded crime during October to December 2020 \nEngland and Wales, quarterly figures (April to June 2015 to October to December 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Source: Home Office \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 4: Falls in police recorded crime during October to December 2020 \nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThe annual decrease was mainly driven by substantial falls during the April to June 2020 period, by 15% (1,247,228 offences) as the first lockdown restrictions were introduced. Police recorded crime increased by 19% in July to September 2020 (1,490,697 offences) as lockdown restrictions gradually eased, however, offences recorded by the police fell by 7% in October to December 2020 (1,382,776 offences) as lockdown restrictions were reintroduced in this period. The number of offences recorded by the police in October to December 2020 remained 9% lower than that recorded in the same period in 2019 (1,517,709 offences). \n\n\nFigure 5: Falls in police recorded crime during October to December 2020 compared with October to December 2019\nEngland and Wales, monthly figures (January to December 2019 and January to December 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 5: Falls in police recorded crime during October to December 2020 compared with October to December 2019\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nFor the months of October to December, the number of recorded offences remained lower in 2020 than their 2019 equivalents. Police recorded crime during this period reduced by 6% in October, 12% in November and 10% in December compared with the same months in 2019. \nAlthough reductions in crime are likely to have been influenced by the lockdown, some differences may be the result of normal monthly variation within the crime types. Changes in police recording and police activity in response to the lockdown are also likely to have contributed, along with changes in the reporting of crime to the police.\nFor more detailed information on improvement in police recording practices prior to the coronavirus pandemic, see Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) report on the State of Policing 2019. \nRecorded theft decreased by 26% in the year ending December 2020 compared with the previous year. This was driven by decreases in offences such as: theft from the person (42%), shoplifting (29%), burglary (24%) and vehicle offences (21%). Theft offences fell by 4% since the previous quarter, the July to September 2020 period. \nTheft offences are driving the reduction in the overall police recorded crime for the latest year. This fall was most likely the result of national lockdown restrictions, with fewer shops being open and people spending more time in their homes. \n\n\nFigure 7: Homicide decreased by 12% in latest year\nEngland and Wales, year ending March 2003 to year ending December 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office \u2013 Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nSome forces have revised their data and police recorded crime totals may not agree with those previously published.\nThe dates shown for the London terrorist attacks in 2005 and 2017 correspond to when the events occurred, rather than when the homicides were recorded by the police.\nData on homicide offences given in these police recorded crime data will differ from data from the Home Office Homicide Index.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 7: Homicide decreased by 12% in latest year\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nThe police recorded 625 homicide offences in the year ending December 2020.

Excluding this incident from the previous year\u2019s homicide count (from 707 to 668 offences), the number of homicides show a 6% decrease (to 625 offences) in the year ending December 2020. \nThe figures include a 19% decrease (from 147 to 119 homicide offences) recorded by the Metropolitan Police Service in the latest year. The rate of homicide remains low at 11 per 1 million people in the year ending December 2020. \nThe number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument (knife-enabled crime) was involved decreased from 269 to 237 offences in the year ending December 2020. Of all recorded homicides in the latest year, 37% were knife-enabled crimes. \nFor the latest headline figures relating to homicide and more detailed figures including data time series see Appendix tables and Other related tables. For Police Force Area breakdowns see Police Force Area data tables.\nPolice recorded crime provides a better measure than the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) of higher harm but less common types of violence, such as those involving a knife or sharp instrument (knife-enabled crime).\n\n!\n\nBecause of the change in knife or sharp instrument data collection practices, police recorded crime figures referenced in this section are not directly comparable with those previously published. \n\n\n\nThere was a 9% decrease in knife-enabled crime recorded by the police in the year ending December 2020 (46,015 offences) compared with the previous year. \nThe annual decrease in knife-enabled crime can be largely attributed to the decrease seen in time periods affected by coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown restrictions. In April to June 2020, offences recorded fell by 20% (from 12,431 to 9,901 offences) compared with the January to March period and fell by 13% in October to December 2020 (from 12,642 to 11,041 offences) compared with the July to September period. \nThe last quarter of 2020 saw a 16% fall in offences recorded, when compared with the same period in 2019 (from 13,219 to 11,041 offences). The decrease in knife-enabled crime was driven mainly by the 29% decrease in knife-enabled robbery offences in the same period (from 6,257 to 4,452 offences). \n\n\nFigure 8: Knife enabled crime decreased in the latest year driven by decrease in robbery offences \nEngland and Wales (excluding Greater Manchester Police), year ending March 2011 to year ending December 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Home Office - Police recorded crime\n\nNotes:\n\nGreater Manchester Police reviewed their recording of offences involving knives or sharp instruments in December 2017 which revealed that they were under-counting these offences. Previous data were not revised at the time and therefore data from Greater Manchester Police are excluded to allow for comparison over time.\nAn adjustment has been made to data prior to the year ending March 2020 for police forces who are now using the NDQIS tool and the total for England and Wales. As more police forces switch to the NDQIS tool, historical data for these forces and for England and Wales will continue to be updated.

This was a decrease of 29% compared with the same period in 2019 and can be attributed to national lockdown restrictions. \nThere is a decrease in \u201cassault with injury and assault with intent to cause serious harm\u201d (7%) offences involving knives or sharp instruments recorded by the police in October to December 2020, compared with 2019. \nPolice recorded \u201cpossession of an article with a blade or point\u201d3 offences similarly fell by 10% to 21,056 offences in the year ending December 2020. Trends in this offence have often been influenced by increases in targeted police action, such as the recent rise in stop and searches.4 Although stop and searches are regularly used, they are used more often following rises in knife-enabled crime. \nFor data relating to knife-enabled crime see Other related tables, for geographic breakdowns see Police Force Area data tables and for sharp instrument homicides see Appendix tables: homicide in England and Wales.

Some forces have also revised data, which means data may not match earlier publications.\nImitation firearms include replica weapons, as well as low-powered weapons which fire small plastic pellets, such as BB guns and soft air weapons.\nOther firearms include CS gas and pepper spray, stun guns and other weapons.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 9: Crimes involving firearms show an 11% decrease compared with the previous year\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nIn October to December 2020, offences involving firearms fell by 19% compared with the previous quarter, July to September 2020 (1,761 offences to 1,422 offences). This fall in offences was most likely the result of national lockdown restrictions during the October to December 2020 period. Further, firearms offences fell by 16% in October to December 2020 compared with October to December 2019. \nFor data relating to offences involving weapons see Offences involving the use of weapons: data tables. For data relating to offences involving firearms see Other related tables.\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides the best picture of the overall trend in violent crime and is a more reliable measure of long-term trends in domestic abuse, sexual assault, stalking and harassment. \nEstimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 1.6 million violent offences in the last 12 months to December 2020. Although not directly comparable with face-to-face CSEW estimates, the estimate for total violence is similar to that reported in recent years. \nPolice recorded crime showed a 2% increase in violence against the person offences (from 1,749,471 to 1,783,512 offences) in the year ending December 2020. In October to December 2020, violence against the person offences decreased by 11% (438,819 offences) in comparison with the previous quarter, July to September 2020 (495,247 offences). \nThere were 588,973 stalking and harassment offences recorded in the year ending December 2020. Data are not comparable with the previous year because of changes in Home Office Counting Rules.1 \nConcerns around confidentiality and respondent safeguarding limit the types of questions asked in the TCSEW. This currently includes those relating to domestic abuse and sexual assault, which we are unable to provide an update on since the CSEW was suspended in March 2020.\n\n!\n\nSexual offences and domestic abuse-related crimes recorded by the police do not provide a reliable measure of trends in these types of crime. Improvements in police recording practices and increased reporting by victims have contributed to increases in recent years, although this effect is thought to be diminishing. The figures do, however, provide a good measure of the crime-related demand on the police.\n\n\n\nPrevious estimates from the CSEW showed that 5.5% of adults aged 16 to 74 years experienced domestic abuse in the last year in the year ending March 2020.\nThere was a 7% increase in the total number of domestic abuse-related offences recorded by the police in the year ending December 2020 (839,077 offences) compared with the previous year. Domestic abuse-related offences have risen by 2% in the October to December 2020 period (to 205,348 offences) compared with October to December 2019 (201,158 offences). Unlike some other offences, the number of domestic abuse-related offences in the latest year has not decreased during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nFurther information and data related to domestic abuse can be found in Domestic abuse in England and Wales overview: November 2020.\nPrevious estimates from the CSEW for the year ending March 2020 showed that 1.8% of adults aged 16 to 74 years had experienced sexual assault (including attempted offences) in the latest year. This was a decrease compared with the previous year (2.4%).\nThe number of sexual offences recorded by the police showed a 7% decrease in the year ending December 2020 (151,059 offences) compared with the previous year. Sexual offences fell by 4% in the October to December 2020 period compared with October to December 2019. \nIn the year ending December 2020, rape, which accounted for 37% of all sexual offences recorded by the police, fell by 6% (55,632 offences). Prior to this decrease, the number of rape offences had been gradually increasing annually. This trend may reflect the diminishing impact of recording improvements as well as the effects of national lockdown restrictions. \nFurther data related to sexual offences can be found in the Sexual offences in England and Wales overview: year ending March 2020 publication. \nFor more detailed figures relating to violent crime including a data time series see Appendix tables.\nCSEW data on the prevalence of domestic abuse, sexual assault and stalking can be found in Table S42 in Annual supplementary tables.\nFor information about Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) and Inspections of police recorded crime and incident data quality see our User guide.\nEstimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 4.5 million fraud offences in the last 12 months to December 2020. Although not directly comparable with estimates from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), the estimate for fraud is similar to that reported in recent years.\nReported fraud offences are recorded and collected by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) from Action Fraud (the public-facing national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre) and two industry bodies, Cifas and UK Finance (who report instances of fraud where their member organisations have been a victim). Latest figures showed a similar number of fraud offences in the year ending December 2020 (754,592 offences) compared with the previous year (743,380 offences). \nIn the year ending December 2020, UK Finance reported 2.9 million cases of fraud involving UK-issued payment cards, remote banking, and cheques via their recording system, CAMIS. This shows a 4% increase compared with the previous year (2.8 million). There was a 68% increase in \u201cremote banking\u201d fraud (73,640 incidents). This increase reflects the greater number of people now regularly using internet, telephone and mobile banking, and the attempts by fraudsters to take advantage of this.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to have had differential effects on trends in fraud offences because of lockdown restrictions. For example, data from Action Fraud showed a 38% increase in \u201conline shopping and auctions\u201d fraud in the latest year (86,984 offences), which could be accounted for by the increase in online shopping because of the closure of shops during national lockdown restrictions. The data also showed a 68% decrease in \u201cticket\u201d fraud (2,532 offences), which could be attributed to cancellation of music gigs and festivals. However, it is too early to say whether this is evidence of a change to longer-term patterns.\nFor the latest headline figures relating to fraud and for more detailed figures including a data time series see Appendix tables and Other related tables and Police Force Area tables.\u2003\u2003\nEstimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 1.7 million computer misuse offences in the last 12 months to December 2020. Although not directly comparable with estimates from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), the TCSEW estimate is similar to that reported in earlier years.\nThere were 29,651 offences referred to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) by Action Fraud in the year ending December 2020, an increase of 28% from the year ending December 2019. \nThis increase was driven by large increases in the two highest-volume computer misuse types reported to Action Fraud. \u201cHacking \u2013 social media and email\u201d saw a 26% increase from 11,101 to 14,004 offences and \u201ccomputer viruses and malware\u201d saw a 30% increase from 5,536 to 7,192 offences. This increase may correlate with the rise in the number of large-scale data breaches around the world. Data breaches included a lot of email and password combinations, enabling potential hacking of social media and email accounts, dependent on the public\u2019s level of cyber-security standards and the likelihood of them using the same password and email for multiple accounts.\nFor the latest headline figures relating to computer misuse and for more detailed figures see Appendix tables and Other related tables.\nIn October to December 2020, 24% of adults perceived crime to have fallen in their local area, a decrease from 33% between July and September 2020. The majority of adults interviewed, however, perceived crime in their local area to have stayed the same (60%), since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.1\nThe majority of adults reported in December 2020 that there had been no change in their level of worry about either crime in general (83%) or fraud (77%) during the coronavirus outbreak.1\nIn October to December 2020, most adults (71%) perceived anti-social behaviour (ASB) levels in their local area to have stayed the same since the start of the coronavirus outbreak1. This is a 3% increase compared with the July to September 2020 period. Most adults (84%) said that ASB was not a big problem in their local area, and 94% of adults had not experienced or witnessed ASB in the past three months. \nOver the past nine months, around half of adults reported noticing others breaching virus restrictions in their local area since the start of the coronavirus outbreak1 (50% in the October to December 2020 period). Of these, 7% reported the breach to the police. The main reason for not reporting a breach was because it was considered too trivial or not worth reporting. \nIn October to December 2020, incidents of ASB recorded by the police (excluding West Midlands2 and British Transport Police) were 41% higher than those recorded in October to December 2019. This increase may reflect the reporting of breaches to public health restrictions, as most police forces include breaches reported to them by members of the public as an ASB incident. \nIn October to December 2020, 52% of adults said that the police were doing a good job. Adults were mostly fairly satisfied (67%) or very satisfied (18%) with the way the police were responding to the coronavirus pandemic. \nFor more detailed figures relating to estimates from the TCSEW see Coronavirus and crime tables.\n\nCrime in England and Wales: Appendix tables  Dataset | Released 13 May 2021  Long-term trends in Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) crime, estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) and police recorded crime, by offence type.Crime in England and Wales: Coronavirus and crime tables  Dataset | Released 13 May 2021  Information from a new module of questions included in the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) around perceptions of crime, the police and anti-social behaviour during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Across London, knife-enabled crime fell by 21% compared with 2019.\nHowever, the number of domestic abuse-related offences recorded by police rose by 7% compared with 2019. A 15% rise in drug offences reflected proactive police activity in crime hotspots during lockdown.\nRecorded offences fluctuated alongside coronavirus restrictions. October to December 2020 saw a 7% decrease in recorded crime compared with the previous three months, as measures were tightened across England and Wales.\nIt follows a 15% fall in April to June 2020 as the first lockdown was imposed, and a 19% rise in July to September 2020, as restrictions were eased over the summer.\nIn 2020, the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales showed there were 12 million offences, including 3.1 million theft, and 4.5 million fraud offences.\n", "id": 446}, {"document": "In England, the percentage of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) shows early signs of a potential increase in the week ending 15 May 2021, although rates remain low; we estimate that 49,000 people within the community population in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 38,800 to 60,300), equating to around 1 in 1,110 people.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive remained low in the week ending 15 May 2021; we estimate that 700 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 100 to 2,000), equating to around 1 in 4,340 people.\nIn Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain in the week ending 15 May 2021; we estimate that 1,200 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 300 to 2,900), equating to around 1 in 1,550 people.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has continued to decrease in the week ending 15 May 2021; we estimate that 2,700 people in Scotland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 1,000 to 5,200) equating to around 1 in 1,960 people.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In institutional settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 can be found in our latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period.\nAll analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nEarly management information from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey is made available to government decision-makers to inform their response to the coronavirus. Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad-hoc or early publications as soon as possible. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding.

In the same week, the number of people testing positive continued to decrease in Scotland and remained low in Wales. Because positivity rates are currently very low in Wales, it is difficult to identify trends as they are affected more easily by small changes in the number of people testing positive from week to week. The trend in the number of people testing positive in Northern Ireland was uncertain in the week ending 15 May 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 10. Because of lower positivity rates, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. Information about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our methods article.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 15 May 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive was observed in Yorkshire and The Humber, although rates were low in all regions and credible intervals are wide.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 15 May 2021, there were early signs of an increase in the percentage of people testing positive in the North East, Yorkshire and The Humber and the South East. The trend was uncertain for all other regions in the same week. In many regions positivity rates are very low so trends will be difficult to identify since they are affected by small changes in the number of people testing positive from week to week.\nWhen positivity rates are low, it is not possible to estimate rates in smaller geographic areas because the numbers within these areas are too small for any estimate to be robust. Because of this low positivity, we are not currently providing sub-regional positivity estimates for the four countries.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 15 May 2021, there were early signs of an increase in the percentage of people testing positive among those aged 2 years to school Year 6, aged 35 to 49 years, and aged 70 years and over, although rates remain low. In the same week, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased for those aged 50 to 69 years. The trend was uncertain for those in school Year 7 to age 24 years, and those aged 25 to 34 years. Because of lower positivity rates, caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trends.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 3 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our dataset and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWhen positivity rates are low, it is not possible to produce age over time analysis by single year of age for all four UK countries because the numbers of people testing positive are too small for any estimate to be robust. As a result, we have not produced these data this week.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period.\nBecause of lower positivity rates, we are carrying out some additional checks on our estimates of incidence (last published 7 May 2021). Therefore, we will not be updating our incidence estimates in this publication. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The variant B.1.1.7 (known as the \u201cUK variant\u201d) of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore B.1.1.7 has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S gene negative) in our main variant analysis. Other variants \u2013 including both B.1.617.2 (first identified in India) and B.1.351 (first identified in South Africa) \u2013 are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. If there is an increase in the prevalence of any of these strains, this will show up in our analysis as an increase in our category \u201cnot compatible with the UK variant\u201d. Our main variant analysis can therefore differentiate between these two groups of variants (ORF1ab+N positive or ORF1ab+S+N positive), but cannot differentiate between variants that have the same gene pattern for the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect. More information on individual variants and where they were first detected is available on the government variant web page.\nOther variants, including B.1.525 (first identified in Nigeria), also have the same pattern of gene positivity as B.1.1.7 (the UK variant). At present these are rare in the UK so we continue to describe this group as compatible with the UK variant, but we will continue to keep this under review. You can read more about the UK variant in our blog. The percentage of people testing positive by different variants are provided in the accompanying technical dataset.\nIn the week ending 15 May 2021 the percentage of people testing positive that are compatible with B.1.1.7 (the UK variant) increased in England; decreased in Wales and Scotland; and, the trend for Northern Ireland was uncertain. The trend in the percentage of people testing positive that are not compatible with the UK variant was uncertain in the week ending 15 May 2021, and remains low, across all four UK countries.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the technical dataset that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus's genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30) - this is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in Office for National Statistics (ONS) data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher). Where we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which virus is which type of variant. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in either cases \u201cnot compatible with the UK variant\u201d or \u201ccompatible with the UK variant\u201d. However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the accompanying technical dataset using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. In the four weeks up to 9 May 2021, we have had four ORF1ab+S+N cases sequenced, of which two were confirmed cases of B.1.617.2 (first detected in India).\nWe also provide information on viruses where we have found a particular genetic change (mutation) called E484K. This mutation is always seen in the South African variant (B.1.351). Laboratory data suggest that this mutation might make it easier for a virus to infect someone again, or to infect someone who has been vaccinated, but the importance of this mutation in terms of its effect in transmitting the virus is still uncertain.\nThis analysis was produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low \u2013 under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our methods article and our recent blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 21 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 21 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 21 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 21 May 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 21 May 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

The trend was uncertain for those in school Year 7 to age 24 years and those aged 25 to 34 years.\nPositivity rates are very low so trends will be difficult to identify since they are affected by small changes in the number of people testing positive from week to week.\n", "id": 447}, {"document": "Other commentary from the latest public sector finances data can be found on the following pages:\nRecent and upcoming changes to public sector finance statistics: April 2021\nUK government debt and deficit: December 2020\nPublic sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks, PSNB ex) is estimated to have been \u00a331.7 billion in April 2021; this is the second highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, \u00a315.6 billion less than in April 2020.\nProvisional April 2021 estimates of central government receipts were \u00a358.0 billion, up \u00a33.8 billion (or 7.0%) compared with April 2020, while central government bodies spent \u00a395.9 billion, down \u00a312.9 billion (or 11.9%) from April 2020.\nPublic sector net borrowing (PSNB ex) in the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021 is estimated to have been \u00a3300.3 billion, revised down by \u00a32.8 billion from last month\u2019s first provisional estimate but remains the highest borrowing since financial year records began in FYE March 1946.\nExpressed as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP), public sector net borrowing (PSNB ex) in FYE March 2021 was 14.3%, revised down by 0.2 percentage points from last month\u2019s first provisional estimate; it remains the highest such ratio since the end of World War Two, when it was 15.2% in FYE March 1946.\nPublic sector net borrowing (PSNB ex) in FYE March 2021 is estimated to have been \u00a327.1 billion less than the \u00a3327.4 billion expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in their Economic and Fiscal outlook \u2013 March 2021 on a like for like basis.\nPublic sector net debt (excluding public sector banks, PSND ex) was \u00a32,171.1 billion at the end of April 2021 or around 98.5% of GDP, the highest ratio since the 99.5% recorded in March 1962.\nCentral government net cash requirement (excluding UK Asset Resolution Ltd and Network Rail) was \u00a330.5 billion in April 2021; the total for FYE March 2021 was \u00a3334.5 billion, substantially more than in any other financial year period since records began in FYE March 1984.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a substantial impact on the economy and subsequently on public sector borrowing and debt. \n\n!\n\nAlthough the impact of the pandemic on the public finances is becoming clearer, its effects are not fully captured in this release meaning that estimates of accrued tax receipts and borrowing are subject to greater uncertainty than usual. \n\n\n\nCentral government tax and National Insurance receipts (combined) in the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021 were \u00a3670.0 billion, a fall of \u00a332.7 billion (or 4.7%) compared with the same period a year earlier. Government support for individuals and businesses during the pandemic contributed to an increase of \u00a3204.1 billion (or 27.6%) in central government day-to-day (or current) spending to \u00a3942.7 billion. \nAs a result of these low receipts and high expenditure, provisional estimates indicate that in FYE March 2021, the public sector borrowed \u00a3300.3 billion, equivalent to 14.3% of the UK\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n\nFigure 1: Borrowing in the financial year ending March 2021 expressed as a percentage of GDP has reached a level last seen at the end of World War Two \nPublic sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks, UK, financial year ending March 1901 to financial year ending March 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Office for Budget Responsibility and Office for National Statistics \u2013 Public sector finances\n\nNotes:\n\nThis chart uses historical data published in the Public finances databank 2020-21.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 1: Borrowing in the financial year ending March 2021 expressed as a percentage of GDP has reached a level last seen at the end of World War Two \nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nIn total, at least 50 schemes have been announced by the UK government and the devolved administrations to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic. Our article Recent and upcoming changes to public sector finance statistics: April 2021 discusses the largest of the coronavirus schemes by implementation status within the public sector finances.\nThe extra funding required by government coronavirus support schemes, combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in GDP have all helped push public sector net debt as a ratio of GDP to levels last seen in the early 1960s. Public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks, PSND ex) at the end of April 2021 was equivalent to 98.5% of GDP. \n\n!\n\nOur estimates expressed as a percentage of GDP are partially based on official projections, which means figures for recent periods are subject to revision, particularly considering the uncertain impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy. \n\n\n\nIn April 2021, the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income requiring it to borrow \u00a331.7 billion, \u00a315.6 billion less than in April 2020 but still the second highest April borrowing on record.\nThe figures for the latest month of every release contain some forecast data. The initial outturn estimates for the early months of the financial year, particularly April, contain more forecast data than other months, as profiles of tax receipts, along with departmental and local government spending are still provisional. This means that the data for these months are typically more prone to revision than other months and can be subject to sizeable revisions in later months.\nThis may be more pronounced in FYE March 2022 than previous years for central government spending as a new HM Treasury administrative system, used to collect the data, is being introduced from June 2021. As with all system changes there is a risk that the outputs will be less stable in the initial stages. We are working with HM Treasury to minimise the impact of this change on these statistics. \nCentral government is the largest sub-sector of the public sector and therefore changes in central government receipts and expenditure usually have the most influence on public sector net borrowing. Public sector finances tables 1 to 10: Appendix A provide further information.\nCentral government receipts were estimated to have increased by \u00a33.8 billion in April 2021 compared with April 2020 to \u00a358.0 billion, including \u00a342.5 billion in tax receipts.\nIn the most recent months, tax receipts recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis are always subject to some uncertainty, as many taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT), Corporation Tax and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Income Tax contain some forecast cash receipts data and are liable to revision when actual cash receipts data are received. The period of uncertainty is longer for taxes with coronavirus deferral schemes, such as VAT, and data for these taxes will be provisional for longer than usual. \nThe data used to inform receipts on a national accounts basis are largely consistent with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) Economic and fiscal outlook \u2013 March 2021 published on 3 March 2021. Where necessary, and if there is sufficient information, further adjustments are made to estimate the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nFurther details of the methods used to estimate the effect of the coronavirus on receipts were provided in Section 12 of Public sector finances, UK: March 2021. There have been no new methodology adjustments this month.\nCentral government bodies spent \u00a395.9 billion in April 2021, \u00a312.9 billion less than in April 2020. \nInterest payments on central government debt were \u00a35.2 billion in April 2021, \u00a30.1 billion more than in April 2020. Changes in debt interest are largely a result of movements in the Retail Prices Index to which index-linked bonds are pegged. \nCentral government departments spent \u00a331.0 billion on goods and services in April 2021, including \u00a316.8 billion on procurement and \u00a312.8 billion in pay. This cost includes the expenditure by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), devolved administrations, and other departments in response to the coronavirus pandemic, including the NHS Test and Trace programme and the cost of vaccines. \u2003\nCentral government current transfers to local government were \u00a316.7 billion in April 2021, \u00a311.6 billion lower than in April 2020. In part, these payments enable local authorities to fund coronavirus policies.\nCurrent and capital transfers between central government and local government are based on administrative data supplied by HM Treasury and have no impact at the public sector level.\nMany of the UK\u2019s regular monthly payments to the EU stopped with effect from January 2021, while others are ending. This month, the UK did not record any of its regular VAT and gross national income-based contributions to the EU budget. Decisions on the recording of future payments such as those outlined in the Withdrawal Agreement will be made in due course.\nCentral government paid \u00a37.5 billion in subsidies to businesses and households in April 2021, \u00a35.9 billion less than in April 2020. These payments included the cost of the job furlough schemes.\nIn April the government spent \u00a33.0 billion on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and \u00a32.5 billion on the Self Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). \nCJRS payments on an accrued basis for the period March 2020 to March 2021 are based on HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) estimates, while the April 2021 amount is based on the OBR\u2019s latest estimates. SEISS payments are currently recorded on a cash basis, reflecting HMRC coronavirus statistics.\nIn the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021 (April 2020 to March 2021), the public sector borrowed \u00a3300.3 billion, \u00a3243.1 billion more than in the same period last year. \nBorrowing had generally been falling since its peak of \u00a3157.7 billion during the economic downturn in FYE March 2010. However, largely as a result of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the \u00a3300.3 billion borrowed in FYE March 2021 was nearly double this previous record.\nCentral government receipts were estimated to have fallen by \u00a331.8 billion (or 4.2%) in FYE March 2021 compared with FYE March 2020 to \u00a3724.9 billion (including \u00a3525.5 billion in tax receipts). Much of this fall occurred in the first half of the financial year (April to September), with the second half of the year showing some signs of recovery.\nIn FYE March 2021, central government support for individuals and businesses during the pandemic contributed to an increase of \u00a3204.1 billion (or 27.6%) in central government day-to-day (or current) spending when compared with FYE March 2020.\nCentral government current transfers to local government were \u00a3149.8 billion in FYE March 2021, \u00a335.1 billion higher than in FYE March 2020, with much of this increase to enable local authorities to fund coronavirus policies. \nSome coronavirus-related current grants that have been paid by central to local government have either not been spent, or have not yet been fully reflected in our estimates of local government spending.\nCentral government paid \u00a3117.3 billion in subsidies to businesses and households in FYE March 2021, \u00a394.8 billion more than in FYE March 2020. This includes the \u00a358.1 billion cost of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and the \u00a319.7 billion cost of the Self Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). \nThe central government net cash requirement (CGNCR), excluding UK Asset Resolution Ltd and Network Rail, is the amount of cash needed immediately for the UK government to meet its obligations. To obtain cash, the UK government sells financial instruments, gilts or Treasury Bills. \nThe amount of cash required will be affected by changes in the timing of tax payments by individuals and businesses but does not depend on forecast tax receipts in the same way as our accrued (or national accounts) based measures.\nThe CGNCR consequently contains the most timely information and is less susceptible to revision than other statistics in this release. However, as for any cash measure, the CGNCR does not reflect the overall amount for which the government is liable or the point at which any liability is incurred \u2013 it only reflects when cash is received and spent. \nTables 7 and 8 demonstrate how CGNCR is calculated from cash receipts and cash outlays. This presentation focuses on the central government\u2019s own account and excludes cash payments to both local government and public non-financial corporations. \nPublic sector net debt represents the amount of money the public sector owes to private sector organisations (including overseas institutions). When the government borrows, this normally adds to the debt total, but it is important to remember that reducing borrowing (the deficit) is not the same as reducing the debt.\nPublic sector net debt (excluding public sector banks, PSND ex) stood at \u00a32,171.1 billion at the end of April 2021, an increase of \u00a3304.6 billion on a year earlier. \nOver the course of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the increase in debt combined with a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) have all helped push public sector net debt as a ratio of GDP to levels last seen in the early 1960s, with debt as a ratio of GDP currently standing at 98.5% at the end of April 2021.\nDebt represents the amount of money owed by the public sector to the private sector and is largely made up of gilts (or bonds) issued to investors by central government. \nThere was \u00a31,888.3 billion of central government gilts in circulation at the end of April 2021 (including those held by the Bank of England (BoE) Asset Purchase Facility Fund). \nThese gilts are auctioned by the Debt Management Office (DMO), on behalf of central government in accordance with its financing remit.\nOn 25 March 2021, the UK government issued \u00a3500 million in its second sovereign Sukuk sale, which added an equivalent amount to central government gross debt, from April 2021.\nThe Sharia compliant bond has a long five-year maturity (22 July 2026) and, as with the UK\u2019s first Sukuk issue (matured 22 July 2019), employs the commonly used Al-ljara structure. \nThe Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) contribution to debt is largely a result of its quantitative easing activities through the BoE Asset Purchase Facility (APF) Fund and Term Funding Schemes (TFS). \nIf we were to remove the temporary debt impact of these schemes along with the other transactions relating to the normal operations of the BoE, public sector net debt excluding public sector banks (PSND ex) at the end of April 2021 would reduce by \u00a3224.6 billion (or 10.2 percentage points of GDP) to \u00a31,946.4 billion (or 88.3% of GDP).\nThe estimated impact of the APF\u2019s gilt holdings on debt currently stands at \u00a3115.1 billion, representing the difference between the value of the reserves created to purchase gilts (or market value of the gilts) and the \u00a3676.8 billion face (or redemption) value of the gilts purchased. \nThe total corporate bond holdings of the APF at the end of April 2021 stood at \u00a319.8 billion, adding an equivalent amount to the level of debt. \nThe TFS loan liability stood at \u00a328.3 billion and the TFSME loan liability stood at \u00a380.7 billion at the end of April 2021, making a combined liability of \u00a3109.0 billion, adding an equivalent amount to the level of debt. \nAssets purchased under the TFS and TFSME fall outside the boundary of public sector net debt excluding public sector banks (PSND ex). Those users who are interested in wider measures of the public sector balance sheet may find estimates of public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) of interest. \nThe data for the latest months of every release contain a degree of forecasts; subsequently, these are replaced by improved forecasts as further data are made available and finally by outturn data. \nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a substantial impact on both tax receipts and expenditure. These impacts are likely to be revised further as the full effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the public finances continue to become clearer.\nSince our last publication (23 April 2021), we have reduced our estimate of borrowing in FYE March 2021 by \u00a32.8 billion. \nImproved data from our suppliers have increased our estimates of central government current receipts by \u00a32.1 billion and our estimate of total central government expenditure by \u00a31.5 billion. \nWithin this additional central government expenditure, grants to local government have increased by \u00a32.3 billion. While this revision has contributed to an increase in central government borrowing, it has had an equal and opposite effect on the borrowing of local government.\nThis month we have incorporated revisions to tax receipts data received from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). \nAs a result of work HMRC has undertaken to improve the quality of assurance activity on the data underpinning tax receipts statistics, errors affecting a number of taxes from FYE March 2016 to FYE March 2020 have been identified and corrected. \nThe receipts most affected by these revisions are VAT, National Insurance contributions, fines and penalties and Income Tax. \nFurther information on these cash revisions can be found in the associated HMRC tax receipts statistics publication HMRC tax receipts and National Insurance contributions for the UK (25 May 2021).\nThe consequential impact of these changes to net borrowing over this five-year period ranges between an increase of \u00a30.4 billion in FYE March 2016 and a reduction of \u00a30.9 billion in FYE March 2018. \nFurther, we have updated our estimates of fines received by central government. We have reduced our previous estimates by \u00a30.5 billion and \u00a30.2 billion in FYE March 2017 and FYE March 2018 respectively. In reducing government receipts in these periods, we have increased borrowing by a corresponding amount.\nThe revisions to the components of central government borrowing are summarised in Public sector finances tables 1 to 10: Appendix A.\nThis month we have reduced our previous estimate of the level of debt at the end of March 2021 by \u00a34.2 billion from that published on 23 April 2021. This change is largely a result of updates to our estimate of the Bank of England\u2019s contribution to net debt, which we have reduced by \u00a33.7 billion in March 2021.\nWe have updated our gross domestic product (GDP) estimates to incorporate GDP first quarterly estimate, UK: January to March 2021 (12 May 2021), leading to small revisions to our previous estimate of debt expressed as a ratio of GDP. \nThe revisions to our debt aggregates are presented in Public sector finances tables 1 to 10: Appendix A.\nThis month we have received balance sheet data for public sector banks for the period July to December 2020. This has enabled us to replace our provisional estimates, reducing net debt by \u00a39.7 billion at the end of March 2021.\n\nPublic sector finances borrowing by sub-sector Dataset | Released 25 May 2021 An extended breakdown of public sector borrowing in a matrix format and estimates of total managed expenditure (TME).

This is the second-highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, \u00a315.6 billion less than in April 2020.\nCentral government receipts were estimated to have increased by \u00a33.8 billion in April 2021 compared with April 2020, reaching \u00a358.0 billion, including \u00a342.5 billion in tax receipts.\nCentral government bodies are estimated to have spent \u00a383.9 billion on day-to-day activities (referred to as current expenditure) in April 2021, \u00a315.5 billion less than a year earlier. Of this, \u00a35.5 billion reflects the cost of the coronavirus job support schemes (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and Self-employment Income Support Scheme), \u00a34.5 billion less than a year earlier.\nIn the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021, the UK public sector borrowed \u00a3300.3 billion, revised down by \u00a32.8 billion from last month\u2019s first provisional estimate. This remains the highest borrowing since records began in FYE March 1946.\nExpressed as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP), public sector net borrowing in FYE March 2021 was 14.3%, revised down by 0.2 percentage points from last month\u2019s first provisional estimate. It remains the highest such ratio since the end of World War Two, when it was 15.2% in FYE March 1946.\nOn a like-for-like basis, borrowing in the FYE March 2021 was \u00a327.1 billion less than the official forecast made by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR expects that borrowing could reach \u00a3233.9 billion in the FYE March 2022.\nThis substantial increase in borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt which currently stands at 98.5% of GDP, the highest ratio since the 99.5% that was recorded in March 1962.\n", "id": 452}, {"document": "Total trade in goods (imports plus exports) from non-EU countries surpassed that from EU countries in Quarter 1 (January to March) 2021.\nTotal trade in goods with EU countries decreased by 23.1% and with non-EU countries decreased by 0.8% comparing Quarter 1 2021 with Quarter 1 2018.\nExports to Ireland saw the greatest proportionate fall of the UK's top exporting partners after the EU transition period.\nImports from Germany have declined since April 2019, coinciding with increased uncertainty around EU exit and, later in 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe UK has imported more goods from China than from any other country since Quarter 2 (April to June) 2020.\nThe early impact of the pandemic seen in Quarter 1 2020 disproportionately affected exports to the United States; decreases in exports to the United States in Quarter 1 2021 are aligned with decreases seen across non-EU countries.\nThe continued global impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, combined with uncertainty surrounding the effect of EU exit have contributed to increased volatility in UK trade in goods across 2020 and into early 2021. It is difficult to fully detangle the impact the coronavirus and EU exit had on UK and international trade while they are still having an influence. We therefore compare with 2018 data for longer-term comparisons as the most recent period in which relatively stable trade patterns were observed.\nWe draw on published, seasonally adjusted official trade statistics from Quarter 1 (January to March) 2018 to Quarter 1 2021; and non-seasonally adjusted trade data at the country by commodity level from January 2020 to March 2021 in dialogue with timely insights in business impacts provided by the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) and real time indicators of UK economic activity. The data provided by BICS and real time indicators give up-to-date insight into potential movements in trade into May 2021.\nTotal trade in goods with EU countries decreased by 23.1% and with non-EU countries decreased by 0.8% comparing Quarter 1 2021 with Quarter 1 2018. Between Quarter 4 (October to December) 2020 and Quarter 1 2021, total trade in goods with EU countries, excluding precious metals, decreased by 20.3%. In the same period total trade in goods with non-EU countries decreased by a lesser 0.4%. There is evidence of bilateral stockpiling of goods in Quarter 4 2020 in the lead-up to the end of the EU transition period. As such, the decreases seen in Quarter 1 2021 should be taken in the context of the increases seen in Quarter 4 2020 (Figure 1). Specific instances of stockpiling will be explored in more detail in Section 3.\nBICS data report that, of currently trading businesses that have reported challenges at the end of February 2021, the largest proportion of businesses' reported main cause of challenge was the end of the EU transition period. This has risen from mid-December 2020 (Figure 2). In contrast, those reporting the coronavirus as their main challenge fell over the same period.\nWhile this evidence does not provide a causal link between the end of the EU transition period and the decrease in total trade observed in the first quarter of 2021, it does provide insight into whether traders are experiencing more challenge with the coronavirus or the end of the transition period, and how these have changed over time.\nPercentage of currently trading businesses that have reported experiencing challenges, weighted by count, December 2020 to April 2021\nDownload the data\nImports of goods from EU countries, excluding precious metals, fell by \u00a314.0 billion (21.7%) between Quarter 4 (October to December) 2020 and Quarter 1 (January to March) 2021, while exports fell by \u00a37.1 billion (18.1%). These falls were consistent across a number of trading partners, such as Ireland and Germany.\nThe disruption to trade is evident from data on UK cargo and tanker visits (seven-day moving average, seasonally adjusted) and in the change in large vehicle counts around ports as shown in Figures 3 and 4.\n\n\nFigure 3: The number of weekly cargo and tanker ship visits to UK ports in January 2021 was on average 20.4% lower than January 2020 reflecting disruption in trade\nUK cargo and tanker weekly visits (seven-day moving average, seasonally adjusted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: exactEarth\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 3: The number of weekly cargo and tanker ship visits to UK ports in January 2021 was on average 20.4% lower than January 2020 reflecting disruption in trade\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The number of large vehicle counts around UK ports fell significantly during January 2021\nMonthly change in average sensor counts of large vehicles (vehicles over 11.66 metres in length) around UK ports, November 2018 to February 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Highways England\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 4: The number of large vehicle counts around UK ports fell significantly during January 2021\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nExports of goods to Ireland saw larger falls than imports after the end of the transition period. Exports of goods to Ireland fell by \u00a31.0 billion (47.3%) between December 2020 and January 2021 (Figure 5), while imports from Ireland fell by a lesser \u00a30.1 billion (4.4%).\nStockpiling particularly of food and chemicals likely took place in Ireland in the months leading up to the end of the transition period, as firms prepared for trade difficulties (Figure 6; Figure 7). Total exports to Ireland in December 2020 were 21.1% higher than December 2019. Exports of chemicals to Ireland in December 2020 had risen to \u00a30.6 billion, increasing by 33.5% compared with the previous year, before falling to \u00a30.1 billion in January 2021.\nExports of goods to Ireland by commodity, January 2019 to March 2021\nDownload the data\nMoreover, the decrease in exports to Ireland seen in Quarter 1 2021, taken in the context of the increase in exports seen in Quarter 4 2020, shows that average exports to Ireland between these periods has increased relative to the same period in 2020 and 2018, and is 3.8% lower than the same period in 2019 (Figure 7).\nTotal goods exports to Ireland, October 2017 to March 2021\nDownload the data\nIn addition to the impact of stockpiling, goods faced new checks when moving from Great Britain to Ireland since January 2021. These checks,\u00a0as\u00a0part of the\u00a0Northern\u00a0Ireland\u00a0Protocol (PDF, 603KB),\u00a0have reportedly caused delays at the Great Britain and Northern Ireland border.\u00a0Results from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) show that, of currently trading businesses that have exported in the last 12 months, 38% have reported additional paperwork as a challenge to exporting since February 2021. This has remained stable through to April 2021.\nExports of food and live animals to Ireland faced the\u00a0greatest\u00a0number of\u00a0new checks. This includes the introduction of export health certificates for animal products moving between Great Britain and Ireland. Exports of food to Ireland fell \u00a30.3 billion (65.9%) between December 2020 and January 2021, although some of this fall may be attributed to the stockpiling of food, which had boosted trade towards the end of 2020.\nRules of origin stipulations in the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement (TCA) require that all goods must be able to demonstrate that they \"originate\" in the EU or the UK to qualify for zero tariff treatment. These stipulations may have led to additional costs associated with re-exporting EU goods, which have gone through UK customs, back to the EU.\nThe impact of this on total UK exports to EU countries is likely small, with only 3.9% of currently trading exporting businesses in BICS reporting currently using rules of origin to access lower or zero tariffs on exports to EU countries at the beginning of May 2021. However, rules of origin may have led to some changes to supply routes. Of the average 4% of businesses who are currently trading and have reported making changes to their supply chains because of the end of the EU transition period in BICS, the proportion changing to using more UK suppliers peaked at 70.5% at the end of February.\nGermany is the UK's largest EU trading partner. Since the beginning of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) trade in goods data time series in 1997, the UK has imported more from Germany than from any other country, with the exception of Quarter 4 2000 and Quarter 1 2001, in which the UK imported more from the United States.\nHowever, since April 2019, there has been a decline in imports from Germany, which coincides with increased uncertainty around previous EU exit dates and, from Quarter 2 2020, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. From Quarter 2 2020, the UK has imported more from China than it has from Germany.\nIn Quarter 1 2021, the proportion of UK total imports from Germany decreased by 2.6 percentage points to 11.8% compared with Quarter 1 2018. Between December 2020 and January 2021, Germany experienced the greatest value goods import fall of any major trading partner, decreasing by \u00a31.7 billion (30.5%) (Figure 8).\nFalls in imports from Germany were driven by road vehicles, which includes cars and car parts, which decreased by \u00a30.7 billion (47.7%) between December 2020 and January 2021 (Figure 9). While, as discussed earlier, stockpiling of commodities, which includes cars and car parts, contributed to elevated import levels towards the end of 2020, the January falls in imports from Germany can also be attributed to the UK national lockdown and closed car showrooms.\nGerman lockdowns and the ongoing global semiconductor shortage caused German automotive production to fall sharply (negative 12.1%) in January. Carmakers including Ford, Audi and BMW have been forced to shut production lines for days at a time to deal with a lack of chips. Although this semiconductor crisis has not been resolved, February and March saw an increase in car imports from Germany.\nImports of road vehicles and chemicals from Germany, January 2019 to March 2021\nDownload the data\nThe coronavirus pandemic has also played a role in reducing trade flows with Germany. German exports worldwide were down 8% year-on-year in January 2021, not just to the UK. Consumer demand in the UK remained low over Quarter 1 2021 as the government kept non-essential shops, leisure and cultural centres closed in the third national lockdown, impacting imports from Germany, the UK's main import market. Imports from Germany saw an increase in March, potentially because of the progress of the UK vaccination programme and preparations for the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. Trade with Germany may also have been impacted by the rules of origin clauses.\nGoods imports from non-EU countries, excluding precious metals, fell by \u00a30.5 billion (0.9%) between Quarter 4 (October to December) 2020 and Quarter 1 (January to March) 2021, while exports increased by \u00a30.1 billion (0.4%). This contrasts the significant falls seen for both imports and exports with the EU. The UK\u2019s top two non-EU trading partners are China and the United States.\nOf the UK\u2019s top five import partners, China is the only one in which imports grew between Quarter 1 2018 and Quarter 1 2021 (Figure 11).\nTotal goods imports by top five import partners, Quarter 1 2018 and Quarter 1 2021\nDownload the data\nImports of goods from China accounted for 16.1% of UK goods imports in Quarter 1 2021 having increased by 65.6% compared with Quarter 1 2018, exhibiting a larger increase than exports. Goods imports from China have continued to show an upward trend throughout 2020 (Figure 11). \nThe recent increase in imports from China shows a continuation of the long-term trend of increasing imports since the beginning of Office for National Statistics (ONS) records in 1997 although this was accelerated during the second half of 2020, likely because of the relatively limited impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on Chinese exports. This, coupled with increasing demand for commodities produced by China such as electronic machinery (telecommunication and sound equipment) likely explains the increasing imports seen in 2020 (Figure 12).\nAdditionally, UK imports of textile fabrics from China jumped in 2020, boosted by demand for face masks and personal protective equipment (PPE), essential in the UK management of the pandemic. China became the first major economy to recover from the pandemic and the only major economy with growth of trade in goods in 2020.\nThe decrease in goods imports from China seen from October 2020 is likely a consequence of unwinding of stocks, with the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) indicating that stockpiling in manufacturing peaked in mid-October, and a drop in seasonal demand for consumer electronics.\nImports from China increased in February and March 2021 driven by clothing and footwear. The proportion of currently trading \"Wholesale and retail trade\" businesses that have imported in the last 12 months, reporting importing more than normal in the BICS increased from 2% in early March 2021 to 7% in late March 2021. Additionally, real time indicators such as retail footfall, pedestrian traffic around city centers and Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) all indicate an increase in high-street traffic towards the end of March in preparation for the opening of shops on 12 April across the UK.\nImports of telecommunications and sound equipment, textiles, and clothing from China, January 2019 to March 2021\nDownload the data\nGoods exports to the United States decreased by \u00a33.6 billion (25.8%) between Quarter 1 and Quarter 2 2020, the largest decrease in exports to any trading partner at that time. In the lead-up to the end of the transition period, however, fluctuations with the United States were not seen as they were with EU trading partners. In January 2021, goods exports to the United States fell \u00a30.2 billion (5.7%) compared with December 2020, considerably less than the EU monthly decline of 42.2% (Figure 13). \nThe fall in exports to the United States can be attributed to the impacts of the coronavirus. The second wave of infections peaked in January 2021 in the UK, causing manufacturers to restrict production. During this month, manufacturing output fell 2.3% and road vehicle exports to the United States fell \u00a30.1 billion (11.3%) (Figure 14).\nExports to the United States rose steadily in February and March 2021. Unwinding of coronavirus restrictions in the UK has contributed to this, allowing manufacturing output to rise 2.1% in March. Rising vaccination rates in the United States have also allowed their economy to partially reopen, boosting demand for imports. Exports to the United States rose \u00a30.4 billion (9.0%) in March. However, Quarter 1 exports to the United States were still 8.9% lower than Quarter 1 2018.\nExports of road vehicles, and chemicals to the United States, January 2019 to March 2021\nDownload the data\nThis article reports the early impacts of the end of the transition period on UK trade. We have seen trade with non-EU countries overtake trade with EU countries for the first time in Quarter 1 2021. However, trade was already at depressed levels because of the ongoing pandemic and recession. It is therefore too early to assess the extent to which the transition period reflects short-term trade disruption or longer-term supply chain adjustments. We will continue to assess this over the coming months.\n\nMore about economy, business and jobs   All ONS analysis, summarised in our economy, business and jobs roundup.

For analysis of BICS, we have used a time series of \"Waves\", which cover a fortnightly period, from mid-November 2020 (Wave 18) to mid-May 2021 (Wave 30).\nIt should be noted that the questions asked in the BICS are changed fairly frequently to reflect changes in the external environment, and this explains differences in the timescales for the evidence from BICS. To avoid the effect of firms who do not trade internationally, all import and export data shown from BICS are from currently trading firms who had imported or exported in the 12 months prior to the wave to which they responded.\nFor questions regarding the last two weeks, businesses were asked for their experience for the reference period. For all other questions, businesses may respond from the point of completion of the questionnaire.\nCaution should be taken when interpreting the results presented as the specific routing of some of the questions means that only a small number of businesses responded.\nEstimates from BICS are not official statistics.\n", "summary": "The reduction in the UK\u2019s total trade in goods has been greater with EU countries than non-EU countries\nUK total trade in goods (imports plus exports) with EU countries decreased by 23.1% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021 compared to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2018. This was because goods exports fell by 24.0% and imports by 22.5%. Total trade in goods with non-EU countries fell by a much smaller 0.8% in the same period.\nTotal goods trade with EU countries reduced by 20.3% between Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 and Quarter 1 2021. Stockpiling both in the UK and in the EU prior to the end of the EU transition period on 1 January 2021 may have contributed to this. Total goods trade with non-EU countries reduced by a lesser 0.4%.\nEvidence from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) shows that, of currently trading businesses that have reported challenges at the end of February 2021, many businesses reported that the end of the EU transition period was a challenge in importing and/or exporting in this period, more so than the pandemic.\nOf the UK\u2019s five largest import partners, only goods imports from China have increased between Quarter 1 2018 and Quarter 1 2021. The 59% growth in imports over this period is in part likely because of China\u2019s exports not being as affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as other countries, and increased demand for electronics and textiles with the latter being caused by increased demand for personal protective equipment (PPE).\n", "id": 453}, {"document": "Overseas residents made 11.1 million visits to the UK in 2020; this was 73% fewer than in 2019 as travel reduced because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nOverseas residents spent \u00a36.2 billion on their visits to the UK in 2020; this was 78% less than in 2019.\nUK residents made 23.8 million visits abroad in 2020, which was 74% fewer than the previous year because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nUK residents spent \u00a313.8 billion on visits abroad in 2020; this was 78% less than in 2019.\nData collection by the International Passenger Survey (IPS) was suspended 16 March 2020, for the period April to December 2020 the figures in this release are based on administrative sources and modelling; estimates prior to April 2020 are based on data collected from the International Passenger Survey.\nTravel and tourism statistics are usually based on the results of the International Passenger Survey (IPS), but the survey was suspended on 16 March 2020 because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

For this reason, the National Statistics status of these statistics for the period January to December 2020 was temporarily suspended under the provisions made for exceptional difficulties encountered in compiling statistics because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nOur modelling indicates that overseas residents made a total of 11.1 million visits to the UK during 2020, a decrease of 73% compared with 2019 (Figure 1). UK residents\u2019 visits abroad in 2020 fell by 74% to 23.8 million. These large falls are attributable to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with travel restrictions and reluctance to travel becoming widespread.\nUK residents spent \u00a313.8 billion on visits abroad in 2020, a fall of 78% compared with 2019. The average spend per visit has decreased from \u00a3670 in 2019 to \u00a3578 in 2020, contributing to the overall decrease in spending. Overseas spending in the UK also fell to \u00a36.2 billion; this was 78% less than in 2019 (Figure 2).\nIn our modelled estimates, which assume that past trends continue, taking holidays was the most popular reason for visiting the UK in 2020, with 4.4 million visits (Figure 3). This was a 74% decrease compared with 2019. Business trips and visits to friends and relatives decreased by 72% compared with 2019 (2.5 million and 3.4 million respectively).\nSimilar trends were observed for different areas of the world. Visits by North American residents decreased by 78% to 1.2 million, visits by European residents decreased by 71% to 8.0 million and visits by residents of \"other countries\" (countries outside of Europe and North America) decreased by 76% to 1.9 million (Figure 3).\nEstimated spending in the UK by overseas visitors decreased by 78% to \u00a36.2 billion in 2020 when compared with 2019.\nOur modelling suggests that there were 23.8 million visits overseas by UK residents in 2020, the lowest figure since 1985.

Visits to \"other countries\" fell by 73% to 4.1 million.\nUsing modelling to extrapolate from past trends, 60% of UK residents' visits abroad were for holidays. There were 14.2 million holiday visits abroad in 2020, a 76% decrease on the previous year (Figure 4).\nVisiting friends or relatives overseas decreased from 23.5 million in 2019 to 6.9 million visits in 2020. The numbers of business trips have varied relatively little over the last 20 years until 2020, where visits of this type fell to 2.3 million in 2020 from 9.0 million in 2019.\nEstimated spending abroad by UK residents decreased by 78% to \u00a313.8 billion in 2020 when compared with 2019.\nThe methods and sources used to produce the estimates presented in this release are primarily the same as what was used to produce Overseas travel and tourism, provisional: April to June 2020 publication in Section 6: Data sources and quality. However, with traffic volumes increasing during Quarter 3 (July to Sep) 2020, and policy changes affecting international travel, these figures are to be treated with caution and are less robust than the previous modelled estimates released.\nThe estimates presented in this article for the whole of 2020 must be treated with particular caution, since the methods used have not been fully scrutinised or tested.\nConfidence intervals have not been provided for these estimates because we would only be able to provide this based on how well the model predicts data already collected by the IPS.

From 10 April 2020 (the first day when data were collected using the CQC\u2019s new method of identifying deaths involving COVID-19) to 4 June 2021, there were 29,405 deaths of residents in care homes involving COVID-19. Of these deaths, 14 were notified in the week up to 4 June 2021.\nBecause of a revision of the coding for the CQC data, it has been identified that some deaths between 2 November 2020 and 22 April 2021 initially coded as \u201cnot COVID-19\u201d have been updated to either \u201cconfirmed COVID-19\u201d or \u201csuspected COVID-19\u201d.

As more deaths are registered, deaths per day are likely to increase, especially for later dates. Looking at the number of deaths that occurred in Week 21, 70.4% of deaths occurred in hospitals, and care homes accounted for 11.1% of all deaths involving COVID-19; this may change as more deaths are registered.\nThe earliest known death involving COVID-19 occurred in the week ending 31 January 2020 (Week 5).\nAcross the UK, there were 10,977 deaths (all causes) registered in Week 21 (week ending 28 May 2021), which was 287 fewer deaths than the UK five-year average, and 244 fewer deaths than in Week 20 (week ending 21 May 2021).\nUsing the most up-to-date data we have available, from the week ending 13 March 2020 up to 28 May 2021, the number of deaths was 856,879. The number of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) was 152,289, and the number of excess deaths above the five-year average was 115,770.\nDeaths in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were all below the five-year average in Week 21.

April 2021 growth was the fastest monthly growth since July 2020, when it grew 7.3%. \nOverall, GDP grew by 1.5% in the three months to April 2021, mainly because of services output, boosted by strong retail sales over the three months. \nLatest month on same month a year ago comparisons should be treated with caution given the impact of base effects on growth rates, because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic throughout 2020. Such comparisons and growth rates can nonetheless be found in our data tables. In comparison with April 2020, monthly GDP in April 2021 is estimated to have grown by 27.6%. \nServices output grew by 3.4% in April 2021 but remained 4.1% below its pre-pandemic level of February 2020. Consumer facing services grew by 12.7% as coronavirus restrictions eased throughout April, with levels recovering to their initial recovery peak in October 2020, as Figure 3 shows. \nRetail sales volumes grew sharply in April 2021 with a monthly increase of 9.2%, reflecting the re-opening of all non-essential retail from 12 April in England and Wales and from 26 April in Scotland. Non-food stores provided the largest contribution to the monthly growth in April 2021 sales volumes, aided by strong increases of 69.4% and 25.3% in clothing stores and other non-food stores respectively. More detail can be found in the Retail sales, Great Britain: April 2021.\nAccommodation service activities grew by 68.6% as caravan parks and holiday lets picked up, while food and beverage service activities grew by 39.0% as pubs, restaurants and cafes could serve customers in outdoor seating areas. \nOther personal service activities (including hairdressing) grew by 63.5% in April 2021, as hairdressing re-opened in England on 12 April. \n\n!\n\nDifferences in the methods for estimating the output of health and education services across different countries mean GDP may be less internationally comparable during the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery than usual, so should be made with increased caution. \n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows education output as the second main contributor to services growth in April 2021, growing 11.2%, as more pupils returned to onsite lessons in April. This contributed 0.72 percentage points to April 2021 monthly growth. Weighted attendance for April 2021 was approximately 93%, compared with 67% in March 2021, and 16% in February 2021. \nNational Accounts revisions policy means that January to March 2021 are currently closed for revisions until GDP quarterly national accounts: January to March 2021 is published on 30 June 2021. There are potential revisions to the profile of the months across the first quarter of 2021 because of updated attendance data, alongside the weighted impact of remote learners. When we are able to revise these estimates, we expect the growth in education in January to be weaker (currently negative 10.0%) and stronger in March (currently 8.6%). Overall it is expected that the education industry will remain in a broadly similar position across the quarter. However, the estimated level and change of education in April is still our best estimate of education activity in the month. Revisions to monthly profiles will be published in our Monthly GDP estimate, UK: May 2021, on 9 July 2021. \nGrowth in human health activities slowed down in April 2021, to 0.1% growth. Output levels remain at record highs driven by coronavirus testing and tracing and vaccine schemes across the UK. \nAdjustments have been applied to the volume data to estimate the impact on real GDP from the NHS test and trace services and vaccine programmes. These adjustments are applied to both the government expenditure data as well as output data, and are applied only to volume data because of the way ONS estimates the output of health services. \nTo calculate the adjustment, in line with the UK National Accounts revisions policy, we have used the latest available quarterly government data and applied indicative volume adjustments to preserve the growth within the health sector and its impact on the economy, rather than applying an adjustment to preserve the level which could give an incoherent growth. \nTable 2 sets out the volume expenditure adjustments for January 2021 to April 2021 split between NHS test and trace services and the vaccine programmes. The reduction in NHS Test and Trace adjustment for April compared with March can be seen in the latest coronavirus daily testing data, which shows a reduction of approximately 22% of total tests between March and April 2021. \nNot all of this extra volume expenditure will be seen in the output of the health industry as there are other industries involved in the production of the vaccines and various testing kits, as well as a number of service industries involved in the logistical process of delivering the programmes.\nAs in Table 2, these estimates are informed by the latest available data including in-year spending data \u2013 the available estimated cost to secure and manufacture vaccines for the UK and deploy vaccines in England and available testing and vaccination data and estimated imports. These are early estimates that will be refined as a new method is introduced later this year.\nOverall, services output grew by 1.4% in the three months to April 2021. This was led by retail sales, which continued to accelerate in growth throughout the three months, partially offset by contraction in education as schools remained closed in February and some of March. \nProduction fell by 1.3% in April 2021, with contraction in three out of the four sectors as Figure 5 shows. This is the first fall since January 2021, when there was a fall of 1.9% as coronavirus restrictions were re-introduced. \nMining and quarrying contributed to most of April\u2019s fall in production output, contributing negative 0.1 percentage points to gross domestic product (GDP) growth. \nThe manufacturing sector contracted slightly by 0.3%, following two months of growth. Five out of the 13 manufacturing sub-sectors fell. The largest contribution to the fall came from the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations (which fell by 16.0%, returning to levels last seen in 2019) and the manufacture of transport equipment (which fell by 2.8%). More detailed breakdowns are available in the Index of Production, UK: April 2021. \nMining and quarrying output contracted by 15.0% in April 2021 mainly because of an 18.2% fall in extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas. Planned temporary closures for maintenance of oil field production sites were an important factor in April\u2019s low output, while latest trade figures point to a fall in fuels exports. \nOverall, output in the production sector increased by 0.5% in the three months to April 2021, driven by manufacturing (in particular, of manufacturing of computer, electronic and optical products), partly offset by the large fall in mining and quarrying in April 2021. \nConstruction output fell by 2.0% in April 2021, following exceptionally strong growth in March. This is the first fall in construction since December 2020, when it fell by 2.2%. \nThe fall in construction output in April 2021 was driven by both a fall in new work (2.9%) and repair and maintenance (0.6%). Despite April\u2019s fall, construction remains slightly above February 2020 levels (0.3%). Further detail on the contributions to construction growth can be found in Construction output in Great Britain: April 2021.\nThe construction sector expanded by 5.1% in the three months to April 2021 because of a 5.2% increase in new work and 4.9% increase in repair and maintenance. \nThe increase in new work (5.2%) was because of growth in all new work sectors apart from private industrial work, which fell by 3.6%, with the largest contributor to growth being private commercial new work which grew by 7.4%. The increase in repair and maintenance (4.9%) in the three months to April 2021 was because of growth in non-housing and private housing repair and maintenance, which grew by 6.2% and 6.6% respectively, and offset the 4.7% fall in public housing repair and maintenance.\n\nMonthly gross domestic product by gross value added Dataset | Released 11 June 2021 The gross value added (GVA) tables showing the monthly and annual growths and indices as published within the monthly gross domestic product (GDP) statistical bulletin.Contributions to monthly GDP Dataset | Released 11 June 2021 Contributions to growth within monthly gross domestic product (GDP), UK.Monthly gross domestic product: time series Dataset | Dataset ID: MGDP | Released 11 June 2021 Monthly estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) containing constant price gross value added (GVA) data for the UK.Monthly GDP and main sectors to four decimal places Dataset | Released 11 June 2021 Monthly index values for monthly gross domestic product (GDP) and the main sectors in the UK to four decimal places.Revisions triangles for monthly GDP Dataset | Released 11 June 2021 Comparison of gross domestic product (GDP) first estimates against estimates published later.\n\n\n", "summary": "The economy grew by 2.3% in April 2021\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by 2.3% in March 2021, the fastest monthly growth since July 2020, as government restrictions affecting economic activity continued to ease.\nThe output approach to GDP shows that April\u2019s level is 3.7% below the levels seen in February 2020, however, it is now 1.2% above its initial recovery peak in October 2020.\nThe service sector grew by 3.4% in April 2021, with consumer facing services re-opening in line with the easing of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions and more pupils returning to onsite lessons.\nAccommodation service activities grew by 68.6% as caravan parks and holiday lets opened up, while food and beverage service activities grew by 39.0% as pubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers in outdoor seating areas.\nOutput in the production sector fell by 1.3% in April 2021.

Fewer non-carers had received their first dose (44%) or had received both doses (16%), however, on average unpaid carers were older (52 years) than non-carers (47 years).\nThere were no statistically significant differences between the percentage of unpaid carers who worked compared with non-carers, however, unpaid carers were more likely to work part-time (31%) than non-carers (25%).\nThe analysis presented has been produced and written in collaboration with the Centre for International Research on Care, Labour and Equalities (CIRCLE).\nThis article contains data and indicators from a module undertaken through the Office for National Statistics\u2019 (ONS) Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) to understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on British society. These are fully reported in the Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain series.\nThis article provides an insight into the social impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on unpaid carers, aged 16 years and over. Care status is self-reported and, for this analysis, a person is considered an \u201cunpaid carer\u201d if they provided a \u201cyes\u201d response to the following question:\n\u201cIn the past seven days, did you look after, or give any help or support to, anyone because they have long-term physical or mental health conditions or illnesses, or problems related to old age? Exclude anything you do as part of your paid employment.\u201d\nMore information can be found in the glossary. Anyone who responded \u201cno\u201d is classified as a \u201cnon-carer\u201d; please note that while these individuals may not be providing unpaid care, they could be providing paid care as part of their employment. Of the sample studied (16,362), 17% (2,950) were unpaid carers, 83% (13,363) were non-carers and <1% (49) refused or did not answer the question.\nThroughout this article, \u201cApril 2021\u201d refers to data collected between 31 March 2021 and 25 April 2021. During this period the \u201crule of 6\u201d was in place in England (29 March 2021), \u201cstay local\u201d restrictions were lifted in Wales (from 27 March 2021), and \u201cstay home\u201d rules in Scotland were replaced by \u201cstay local\u201d rules (2 April 2021). For more information on the periods referred to in this article see Section 9: Data sources and quality.\nThis article presents a summary of results, with further information and data confidence intervals for the estimates contained in the associated dataset. Any differences mentioned in this article are statistically significant unless stated otherwise (refer to glossary for definition).\nData used in this publication will be used to report toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator 5.4.1, which measures the proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic care work by sex, age and location. For more information on SDGs, please visit the UK SDG data site, or contact sustainabledevelopment@ons.gov.uk.\nIn April 2021, more women (57%) provided unpaid care than men (43%), but there was no significant difference in the proportion of hours that men and women spent caring (Figure 1). These findings are in line with estimates in England and Wales from the 2011 Census, which show a higher proportion of women (58%) self-reporting as unpaid carers compared with men (42%).\nThe proportion of people who were unpaid carers (24%) was highest in the age group 55 to 64 years (Figure 2). Unpaid carers were older than non-carers with an average age of 52 years in comparison to 47 years. Further age breakdowns are available in the accompanying datasets.\nThere were no significant differences between men and women in the types of care activities provided (Figure 3). The most common care activity provided was \u201cbeing available if needed\u201d (69% men, 66% women).\nA higher proportion of unpaid carers than non-carers stated that they were disabled (32% compared with 23%) (refer to glossary for definition of disability). Although unpaid carers were older than non-carers, Figure 4 shows that there were more disabled unpaid carers than disabled non-carers in the following age groups:\n16 to 24 years (32% of unpaid carers were disabled compared with 17% for non-carers)\n25 to 34 years (36% compared with 16%)\n45 to 54 years (32% compared with 19%)\nThere were no statistically significant differences in disability for carers and non-carers for the other age groups.\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the number of unpaid carers (61%) and non-carers (64%) who stated that they worked. A working adult is someone who had a paid job, either as an employee or self-employed, did any casual work for payment or did unpaid voluntary work in the previous week (refer to the glossary for definition). Similarly, there were no significant differences between unpaid carers and non-carers working at each age group. Further breakdowns of age and employment can be found in the associated datasets.\nFigure 5 shows as care hours increase, unpaid carers are less likely to work. Among unpaid carers providing more than 50 hours of care a week, over two-thirds (68%) were not working - this figure was considerably higher than unpaid carers providing less than 2 hours (33%), 2 to 4 hours (30%), 5 to 9 hours (38%), 10 to 19 hours (35%), and 20 to 34 hours (37%). Further breakdowns of working by care hours and age are available in the accompanying datasets.\nOf the people who stated they were not an employee or self-employed, a similar percentage of unpaid carers (91%) and non-carers (89%) were not looking for work. Being retired was the main reason stated for not looking for work, although there were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of unpaid carers (66%) compared with non-carers (64%) who were retired.\nAmong all respondents who stated that they were either an employee or self-employed, those who were unpaid carers were more likely than non-carers to work part-time (31% compared with 25%) (Figure 6). Unpaid carers who were women (43%) were more likely to work part-time than unpaid carers who were men (18%); the same pattern is evident in non-carers.\nApproximately one third of unpaid carers (31%) lived with someone who was sick, disabled or over the age of 70 years who they looked after or to whom they gave special help (compared with just 4% of non-carers). Nearly all unpaid carers who provided more than 50 hours of care per week (90%) lived with someone who was sick, disabled or over the age of 70 years - a higher percentage than for all other weekly hours of care.\nUnpaid carers were more likely to avoid physical contact with others when outside the household (92%) compared with non-carers (88%), although a lower proportion (65%) of unpaid carers stated that they had avoided contact with older people or other vulnerable people because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic compared with non-carers (71%). Of the people who stated they had avoided contact with others, a higher proportion (29%) of unpaid carers stated that they had caring responsibilities for the people with whom they had avoided contact, compared with non-carers (3%).\nThe majority of unpaid carers (63%) were worried (\u201cvery worried\u201d or \u201csomewhat worried\u201d) about the effects that the coronavirus pandemic was having on their life; this proportion was higher than non-carers (56%).\nFigure 7 shows that more unpaid carers than non-carers indicated that coronavirus had affected:\nlife events (for example, weddings and funerals) (44% unpaid carers compared with 40% non-carers)\nwork (30% compared with 26%)\naccess to healthcare and treatment for non-coronavirus-related issues (30% compared with 20%)\nhealth (16% compared with 13%)\ncaring responsibilities (16% compared with 3%)\naccess to groceries, medication and essentials (15% compared with 10%)\nThere was no difference in the proportions of unpaid carers and non-carers who stated that they had left the house in the past seven days (96% for unpaid carers, 95% for non-carers).\nFigure 8 shows unpaid carers more frequently reported leaving their home for the following reasons:\nto go shopping for food or medicine (78% for unpaid carers, 73% for non-carers)\nto provide care or to help a vulnerable person (34% for unpaid carers, 1% for non-carers)\nto meet people in a support bubble (31% for unpaid carers, 20% for non-carers)\nfor a medical need, including vaccination (20% for unpaid carers, 15% for non-carers)\nIn April 2021, 93% of the whole sample (age 16 years and over) reported they had either received the first dose or the second dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, had been offered a vaccine and were awaiting it, or would be likely (very or fairly likely) to have a vaccine if offered.\nThis \u201cpositive vaccine sentiment\u201d\u00b9 is made up of those who either reported that they:\nhad received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (57% unpaid carers, 44% non-carers)\nhad received the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (20% unpaid carers, 16% non-carers)\nhad been offered a vaccine and were awaiting it (3% unpaid carers, 2% non-carers); this difference is not significantly different between carers and non-carers.\nhad not yet been offered a vaccine but were likely (very or fairly likely) to have one when offered (16% unpaid carers, 31% non-carers)\nFurther exploration of vaccination sentiment by age group shows that unpaid carers aged 35 to 44 years were more likely to have had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine than non-carers (38% unpaid carers, 27% non-carers) and non-carers were more likely (very or fairly likely) to have a vaccine if offered than unpaid carers (39% unpaid carers, 52% non-carers). Similarly, non-carers aged 45 to 54 years were more likely to have a vaccine if offered than unpaid carers (6% unpaid carers, 13% non-carers). There were no further significant differences between unpaid carers and non-carers for age and vaccine sentiment breakdowns. These breakdowns can be found in the associated datasets.\nThe Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) does not include people living in care homes or other establishments, so will not capture vaccinations that have occurred in these settings. Because of small sample sizes, the percentage of adults who have declined a vaccine should be treated with caution.\nAs such, interpretation of the proportions of different groups of people who have received at least one dose of the vaccine should be treated with caution and may not always reflect information available in other administrative data. More information can be found in Section 9: Data sources and quality.\n\nCoronavirus and the social impacts on unpaid carers in Great Britain Dataset | Published 10 June 2021 Indicators from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Opinions and Lifestyle Survey to understand the impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on unpaid carers in Great Britain. \n\n\nThe Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) is a monthly omnibus survey. In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we adapted the OPN to become a weekly survey used to collect data on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on day-to-day life in Great Britain.\nTo enable more detailed analysis, such as the care hours breakdowns, four waves of this weekly OPN data have been pooled together and reweighted to create a larger dataset.\nThroughout this article, April 2021 refers to data collected between 31 March 2021 and 25 April 2021, a period in which some easing of lockdown restrictions began. Survey responses were collected using an online self-completion questionnaire or over the phone.\nSome survey questions asked for people's responses in reference to \"the past seven days\". These results have been presented as representing people's views during March and April 2021, even though attitudes may have changed slightly between the four waves included.\nWhere differences between groups are presented in this article, confidence intervals, which are included in the associated dataset, indicate their significance.\nEstimates in this article are rounded to whole numbers. Where individual answer categories for a question have been combined to provide an estimate, the total may not sum to the total of individual categories because of this rounding.\nFor each wave, a sample was randomly selected from those that had previously completed the Labour Market Survey (LMS). From each household, one adult was selected at random but with unequal probability. Younger people were given higher selection probability because of under-representation in the sample available. The survey also includes a boosted sample for England, to allow more detailed analysis at a regional level, which is available in the datasets of the Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain publications.\nThe responding sample in the four waves contained 16,362 individuals (68% response rate). Survey weights were applied to make estimates representative of the population.\nWeights were first adjusted for non-response and attrition. Subsequently, the weights were calibrated to satisfy population distributions considering the following factors: sex by age, region, tenure, highest qualification and employment status. The resulting weighted sample is representative of the adult population of Great Britain by several socio-demographic factors and geography.\nStrengths of the OPN include:\nit allows for timely production of data and statistics that can respond quickly to changing needs\nthe questionnaire is developed with customer consultation, and design expertise is applied in the development stages\nrobust methods are adopted for the survey's sampling and weighting strategies to limit the impact of bias\nquality assurance procedures are undertaken throughout the analysis stages to minimise the risk of error\nLimitations of the OPN include:\nanalysis of estimates in Wales and Scotland are based on low sample sizes, and therefore caution should be used with these estimates\ncomparisons between periods and groups must be done with caution as estimates are provided from a sample survey; as such, confidence intervals are included in the datasets to present the sampling variability\nMore quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain and the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey QMI.\n", "summary": "Unpaid carers concerned about impact of pandemic on daily life\nThe majority of people providing unpaid care to someone else worry about the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on their daily life (63% compared with 56% for non-carers).\n\u201cUnpaid carers\u201d are people aged 16 years and over who cared for someone in the last seven days because they had long-term physical or mental health conditions or illnesses, or problems related to old age, excluding anything they did as their paid employment.\nResults from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey from 31 March 2021 to 25 April 2021 found that around one third of unpaid carers (31%) lived with someone who was sick, disabled or over the age of 70 years who they looked after or gave special help to (compared with 4% of non-carers).\nMore unpaid carers than non-carers said coronavirus had affected their life in the following ways:\n - life events (for example, weddings and funerals) (44% unpaid carers compared with 40% non-carers)\n - work (30% compared with 26%)\n - access to healthcare and treatment for non-coronavirus-related issues (30% compared with 20%)\n - health (16% compared with 13%)\n - caring responsibilities (16% compared with 3%)\n - access to groceries, medication and essentials (15% compared with 10%)\nMore women (57%) provided unpaid care than men (43%) but there were no significant differences between men and women in the number of hours, or type of care provided.\nOn average, unpaid carers were older (52 years) than non-carers (47 years).

More information on identifying CEV people, guidance for clinically extremely vulnerable people and collecting the data can be found in the Glossary and Measuring the data sections.\nThe data reported in this bulletin were collected during a time in which CEV people were not advised to shield. Because of this, we expect the behaviours of CEV people to be different in wave five (17 to 22 May 2021) compared with waves one, two and three, which were collected when CEV people were being advised to shield (before 31 March 2021).\nDespite all CEV people being advised they no longer need to shield from 1 April 2021, 43% of the CEV population have continued to shield. This is statistically significantly lower, compared with 50% who reported continuing to shield in wave four (collected between 26 April and 1 May 2021).\nAlthough shielding guidance has paused, CEV people are still advised to take additional precautionary measures to keep themselves safe.

In institutional settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic from the ONS and other sources can be found in our latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period.\nAll analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nEarly management information from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey is made available to government decision-makers to inform their response to COVID-19.

In England, the percentage of people testing positive has continued to increase in the week ending 12 June 2021. In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive remains low in the week ending 12 June 2021. In the same week, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive remains uncertain for Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 10. Because of lower positivity rates caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. Information about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our methods article.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 12 June 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive was observed in the North West.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 12 June 2021, the percentage of people testing positive has increased in the North West and the West Midlands. The percentage of people testing positive also increased in the South East over the two weeks up to 12 June 2021, but the trend is uncertain in the most recent week. In the East of England and the East Midlands, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the week ending 12 June 2021. The trend is uncertain for all other regions in the same week. In many regions positivity rates are very low, so trends will be difficult to identify since they are affected by small changes in the number of people testing positive from week to week.\n.XLSX\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 12 June 2021, the percentage of people testing positive has increased in those in school Year 12 to age 34 years old. There are possible signs of a decrease in the percentage of people testing positive in those in school Years 7 to 11 in the week ending 12 June 2021. In the same week, the trend in the percentage testing positive is uncertain for all other age groups. Because of lower positivity rates, caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trends.\n.XLSX\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 3 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our dataset and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWhen positivity rates are low, it is not possible to produce age over time analysis by single year of age for all four UK countries because the numbers of people testing positive are too small for any estimate to be robust. As a result, we are not currently updating these data. Previously published data are available in the accompanying datasets for each UK country.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period.\nWe regularly review our methods and survey design as part of our ongoing quality assurance process. Our incidence method uses several weeks' data to provide the latest estimate of new infections. Because of lower numbers of people testing positive over the last several weeks compared with earlier in the year, we are reviewing our estimates of incidence (last published 7 May 2021). This review ensures that the estimates we provide continue to be of high quality. Therefore, we will not be updating our incidence estimates in this publication. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) have suggested new names for Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest.\nAlphaVariant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK.\nBetaVariant B.1.351, first identified in South Africa.\nGammaVariant P.1, first identified in Brazil.\nDeltaVariant B.1.617.2, first identified in India.\nEtaVariant B.1.525, first identified in Nigeria.\nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19 identified in the UK in mid-November 2020 has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative) in our main variant analysis.\nOther variants \u2013 including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) \u2013 are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Based on recent information from genomic sequencing and Test and Trace, it is likely that most ORF1ab+S+N cases will be the Delta variant. Therefore, if there is an increase in the prevalence of any of these strains, this will show up in our analysis as an increase in our category \"compatible with the Delta variant\". Our main variant analysis can differentiate between these two groups of variants (ORF1ab+N positive or ORF1ab+S+N positive), but cannot differentiate between variants that have the same gene pattern for the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect. More information on individual variants and where they were first detected is available on the government variant dashboard.\nOther variants, including Eta (B.1.525), also have the same pattern of gene positivity as Alpha (B.1.1.7). At present these are rare in the UK so we continue to describe this group as compatible with the Alpha variant, but we will continue to keep this under review. The percentage of people testing positive by different variants are provided in the accompanying technical dataset.\nIn the week ending 12 June 2021, the percentage of people testing positive whose results are compatible with the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) remains low in Wales whilst the trend is uncertain in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nIn the week ending 12 June 2021, the percentage of people testing positive whose results are compatible with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) continued to increase in England and remains low in Wales, whilst the trend is uncertain in Northern Ireland and Scotland. \nThe percentage of people testing positive by variant category in England is shown in Figure 4. Because of the low number of positive results there is a greater degree of uncertainty in the percentage of people testing positive by variant category for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland; the direction of the trends are also uncertain. Therefore, we are not presenting this data in Figure 4 in this publication. We will continue to review whether we include charts by variant category for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland based on the degree of uncertainty in the estimates and the direction of the trend. The percentage of people testing positive by different variants for all four UK countries are provided in the accompanying technical dataset.\n.XLSX\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the technical dataset that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus's genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30) \u2013 this is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher). Where we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which virus is which type of variant. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in either cases \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the accompanying technical dataset using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. In the most recent four weeks up to the week ending 6 June 2021, the majority (61%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2) with Alpha (B.1.1.7) comprising most of the remainder (32%) of sequences.\nWe also provide information on viruses where we have found a particular genetic change (mutation) called E484K. This mutation is always seen in Beta (B.1.351).\nLaboratory data suggest that this mutation might make it easier for a virus to infect someone again, or to infect someone who has been vaccinated, but the importance of this mutation in terms of its effect in transmitting the virus is still uncertain.\nThis analysis was produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our methods article and our recent blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 18 June 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 18 June 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 18 June 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 18 June 2021 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 18 June 2021 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

This was \u00a328.2 billion less than the \u00a3327.4 billion expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in their Economic and Fiscal outlook \u2013 March 2021 on a like-for-like basis.\n\n\nFigure 1: Borrowing in the financial year ending March 2021 expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product has reached a level last seen at the end of World War Two\nPublic sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks, UK, financial year ending March 1901 to financial year ending March 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Office for Budget Responsibility and Office for National Statistics \u2013 Public sector finances\n\nNotes:\n\nThis chart uses historical data published in the Public finances databank 2020-21.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 1: Borrowing in the financial year ending March 2021 expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product has reached a level last seen at the end of World War Two\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nIn total, at least 50 schemes have been announced by the UK government and the devolved administrations to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic. Our article Recent and upcoming changes to public sector finance statistics: May 2021 discusses the largest of the coronavirus schemes by implementation status within the public sector finances.\nThe extra funding required by government coronavirus support schemes, combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in GDP have all helped push public sector net debt as a ratio of GDP to levels last seen in the early 1960s. Public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks, PSND ex) at the end of May 2021 was equivalent to 99.2% of GDP. \n\n!\n\nOur estimates expressed as a percentage of GDP are partially based on official projections, which means figures for recent periods are subject to revision, particularly considering the uncertain impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy. \n\n\n\nThe public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income in May 2021, requiring it to borrow \u00a324.3 billion, the second-highest May borrowing on record.\nThe figures for the latest month of every release contain some forecast data. The initial outturn estimates for the early months of the financial year, particularly April and May, contain more forecast data than other months, as profiles of tax receipts, along with departmental and local government spending are still provisional. Therefore the data for these months are typically more prone to revision than other months and can be subject to sizeable revisions in later months. \nThis situation may be more pronounced in financial year ending (FYE) March 2022 than previous years for central government spending. A new HM Treasury (HMT) administration system, used to collect the data, was introduced from June 2021 and used for the first time in this release. As with all system changes there is a possibility that the outputs will be less stable in the initial stages. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is working with HMT to minimise the impact of the system change on these statistics.\nCentral government is the largest sub-sector of the public sector and therefore changes in central government receipts and expenditure usually have the most influence on public sector net borrowing. Public sector finances tables 1 to 10: Appendix A provide further information.\nCentral government receipts were estimated to have increased by \u00a37.5 billion (or 15.2%) in May 2021 compared with May 2020, to \u00a356.9 billion, including \u00a341.4 billion in tax receipts.\nIn the most recent months, tax receipts recorded on an accrued (or national accounts) basis are always subject to some uncertainty, as many taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT), Corporation Tax and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Income Tax contain some forecast cash receipts data and are liable to revision when actual cash receipts data are received. The period of uncertainty is longer for taxes with coronavirus deferral schemes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT), and data for these taxes will be provisional for longer than usual. \nThe data used to inform receipts on a national accounts basis are largely consistent with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) Economic and fiscal outlook \u2013 March 2021 published on 3 March 2021. Where necessary, and if there is sufficient information, further adjustments are made to estimate the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nFurther details of the methods used to estimate the effect of the coronavirus on receipts were provided in Section 12 of Public sector finances, UK: March 2021. There have been no new methodology adjustments this month.\nFrom April 2021, Corporation Tax estimates have been affected to some extent by the introduction of the super-deduction capital allowance, providing tax incentives for those companies investing in qualifying new plant and machinery assets. \nCentral government bodies spent \u00a381.8 billion in May 2021, \u00a310.9 billion (or 11.7%) less than in May 2020. \nInterest payments on central government debt were \u00a34.3 billion in May 2021, \u00a30.9 billion (or 26.0%) more than in May 2020. Changes in debt interest are largely a result of movements in the Retail Prices Index to which index-linked bonds are pegged. \nCentral government departments spent \u00a330.9 billion on goods and services in May 2021, including \u00a317.4 billion on procurement and \u00a312.9 billion in pay. This cost includes the expenditure by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), devolved administrations and other departments in response to the coronavirus pandemic including the NHS Test and Trace programme and the cost of vaccines.\nCentral government current transfers to local government were \u00a310.7 billion in both May 2021 and May 2020. In part, these payments enable local authorities to fund coronavirus policies. \nCurrent and capital transfers between central government and local government are based on administrative data supplied by HM Treasury and have no impact at the public sector level.\nMany of the UK\u2019s regular monthly payments to the EU stopped with effect from January 2021, while others are ending. This month, the UK did not record any of its regular VAT and gross national income-based contributions to the EU budget. In July 2021, we expect to confirm a decision on the recording of future payments such as those outlined in the Withdrawal Agreement. \nCentral government paid \u00a38.3 billion in subsidies to businesses and households in May 2021, \u00a311.6 billion (or 58.4%) less than in May 2020. This includes the \u00a35.2 billion cost of the job furlough schemes, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and the Self Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). \nIn May 2021, the government spent \u00a32.5 billion on the CJRS, \u00a37.6 billion (or 75.4%) less than in May 2020. While CJRS payments on an accrued basis for the period March 2020 to April 2021 are based on HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) estimates, the May 2021 amount is based on the OBR\u2019s latest estimates. \nIn May 2021, the government spent \u00a32.7 billion on the SEISS, \u00a34.1 billion (or 59.7%) less than in May 2020. SEISS payments are currently recorded on a cash basis, consistent with HMRC coronavirus statistics.\n\nMore about economy, business and jobs   All ONS analysis, summarised in our economy, business and jobs roundup.

Official forecasts suggest that borrowing may reach \u00a3233.9 billion by the end of the financial year.\nBorrowing had generally been falling since its peak of \u00a3157.7 billion during the economic downturn in financial year ending (FYE) March 2010. However, largely as a result of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the \u00a3299.2 billion borrowed in FYE March 2021 was nearly double this previous record.\nCentral government receipts were estimated to have increased by \u00a311.4 billion (or 11.1%) in financial year-to-May 2021 compared with the same period a year earlier, to \u00a3115.0 billion, which includes \u00a383.7 billion in tax receipts. \nCentral government day-to-day (or current) spending was estimated to have decreased by \u00a325.3 billion (or 13.6%) in financial year-to-May 2021 compared with the same period a year earlier, to \u00a3160.3 billion. \nCentral government current transfers to local government were \u00a328.5 billion in the financial year-to-May 2021, \u00a310.6 billion (or 27.0%) less than in the same period a year earlier. \nSome coronavirus-related current grants that have been paid by central to local government have either not been spent, or have not yet been fully reflected in our estimates of local government spending.\nCentral government paid \u00a316.9 billion in subsidies to businesses and households in the financial year-to-May 2021, \u00a316.5 billion (or 49.4%) less than in the same period a year earlier. This includes the \u00a310.4 billion cost of the job furlough schemes, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and the Self Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). \nIn the financial year-to-May 2021 the government spent \u00a35.1 billion on the CJRS, \u00a315.1 billion (or 74.6%) less than a year earlier. Over the same time periods, the government spent \u00a35.2 billion on the SEISS, a reduction of \u00a31.6 billion (or 23.1%).\nThe central government net cash requirement (CGNCR), excluding UK Asset Resolution Ltd and Network Rail, is the amount of cash needed immediately for the UK government to meet its obligations. To obtain cash, the UK government sells financial instruments, gilts or Treasury Bills. \nThe amount of cash required will be affected by changes in the timing of tax payments by individuals and businesses but does not depend on forecast tax receipts in the same way as our accrued (or national accounts) based measures.\nThe CGNCR consequently contains the most timely information and is less susceptible to revision than other statistics in this release. However, as for any cash measure, the CGNCR does not reflect the overall amount for which the government is liable or the point at which any liability is incurred \u2013 it only reflects when cash is received and spent. \nOn 11 May 2021, the government announced the sale of \u00a31.1 billion of its holding in NatWest Group plc, bringing its level of ownership down from 59.8% to 54.8%. \nAs with similar sales the cash raised impacts directly on CGNCR and indirectly on net debt in the month the payment was received \u2013 in this case central government net cash requirement in May 2021 was reduced by \u00a31.1 billion as a result of the sale. Net borrowing is unaffected by the sale of financial assets.\nTables 7 and 8 demonstrate how CGNCR is calculated from cash receipts and cash outlays. This presentation focuses on the central government\u2019s own account and excludes cash payments to both local government and public non-financial corporations. \nPublic sector net debt represents the amount of money the public sector owes to private sector organisations (including overseas institutions). When the government borrows, this normally adds to the debt total, but it is important to remember that reducing borrowing (the deficit) is not the same as reducing the debt.\nPublic sector net debt (excluding public sector banks, PSND ex) stood at \u00a32,195.8 billion at the end of May 2021, an increase of \u00a3259.1 billion on the same period last year. \nOver the course of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the increase in debt combined with a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) have all helped push public sector net debt as a ratio of GDP to levels last seen in the early 1960s, with debt as a ratio of GDP currently standing at 99.2% at the end of May 2021.\nDebt represents the amount of money owed by the public sector to the private sector and is largely made up of gilts (or bonds) issued to investors by central government. \nThere was \u00a31,913.0 billion of central government gilts in circulation at the end of May 2021 (including those held by the Bank of England (BoE) Asset Purchase Facility Fund). \nThese gilts are auctioned by the Debt Management Office (DMO), on behalf of central government in accordance with its financing remit.\nOn 25 March 2021, the UK government issued \u00a3500 million in its second sovereign Sukuk (maturing in 22 July 2026), which added an equivalent amount to central government gross debt, from May 2021.\nThe Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) contribution to debt is largely a result of its quantitative easing activities through the BoE Asset Purchase Facility (APF) Fund and Term Funding Schemes (TFS). \nIf we were to remove the temporary debt impact of these schemes along with the other transactions relating to the normal operations of the BoE, public sector net debt excluding public sector banks (PSND ex) at the end of May 2021 would reduce by \u00a3226.4 billion (or 10.2 percentage points of GDP) to \u00a31,969.4 billion (or 89.0% of GDP).\nThe estimated impact of the APF\u2019s gilt holdings on debt currently stands at \u00a3117.9 billion, representing the difference between the value of the reserves created to purchase gilts (or market value of the gilts) and the \u00a3691.3 billion face (or redemption) value of the gilts purchased. \nThe total corporate bond holdings of the APF at the end of May 2021 stood at \u00a319.8 billion, adding an equivalent amount to the level of debt. \nThe TFS loan liability stood at \u00a327.5 billion and the TFSME loan liability stood at \u00a383.0 billion at the end of May 2021, making a combined liability of \u00a3110.5 billion, adding an equivalent amount to the level of debt. \nAssets purchased under the TFS and TFSME fall outside the boundary of public sector net debt excluding public sector banks (PSND ex). Those users who are interested in wider measures of the public sector balance sheet may find estimates of public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) of interest. \nThe data for the latest months of every release contain a degree of forecasts; subsequently, these are replaced by improved forecasts as further data are made available and finally by outturn data. \nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a substantial impact on both tax receipts and expenditure. These impacts are likely to be revised further as the full effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the public finances continue to become clearer.\nSince our last publication (25 May 2021), we have reduced our estimate of borrowing in April 2021 by \u00a32.6 billion. \nCentral government borrowing reduced by \u00a31.3 billion largely because of a \u00a31.9 billion reduction in our previous estimate of net capital investment spending, partially offset by a smaller \u00a30.8 billion increase in day-to-day (current) spending. Further, improved data from our suppliers have increased our estimates of central government current receipts by \u00a30.2 billion. \nLocal government borrowing reduced by \u00a31.2 billion, largely because of a \u00a31.1 billion increase in grants received from central government. While these additional grants reduced local government borrowing, the additional central government expenditure increased central government borrowing by an equal and offsetting amount, having no overall impact on public sector borrowing.\nSince our last publication (25 May 2021), we have reduced our estimate of borrowing in FYE March 2021 by \u00a31.1 billion. \nCentral government borrowing reduced by \u00a31.5 billion largely because of an increase of \u00a30.8 billion in tax receipts data from our suppliers along with a reduction of \u00a30.4 billion in our previous estimate of net capital investment spending. Overall day-to-day (current) spending was largely unchanged, with increases in debt interest and net social benefits being almost entirely offset by a reduction in expenditure on goods and services.\nLocal government borrowing increased by \u00a31.0 billion largely because of including provisional capital spending outturn data for England. These data led to an increase in net capital investment spending of \u00a31.4 billion, largely in gross fixed capital formation.\nThe revisions to the components of central and local government borrowing are summarised in Public sector finances tables 1 to 10: Appendix A.\nPublic corporations\u2019 borrowing remains based on Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates. This month we have updated our estimates for January to March 2021 based on data received from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), HM Treasury and other survey data, resulting in an overall reduction of \u00a30.6 billion compared with our previous estimate.\nThis month we have reduced our previous estimate of the level of debt at the end of April 2021 by \u00a30.2 billion from that published on 25 May 2021. This change is largely the result of several smaller updates to local government and public corporations\u2019 contribution to debt, which are fully updated on a quarterly basis. \nThe revisions to our debt aggregates are presented in Public sector finances tables 1 to 10: Appendix A.\n\nPublic sector finances borrowing by sub-sector Dataset | Released 22 June 2021 An extended breakdown of public sector borrowing in a matrix format and estimates of total managed expenditure (TME).

While May\u2019s borrowing was only around a half of that in May last year, it was still more than four times that of May 2019.\nCentral government receipts were estimated to have increased by \u00a37.5 billion in May 2021 compared with May 2020, reaching \u00a356.9 billion. Of these receipts, taxes were \u00a341.4 billion, \u00a36.0 billion more than in May last year and broadly in line with those of May 2019.\nCentral government bodies were estimated to have spent \u00a375.6 billion on day-to-day activities (referred to as current expenditure) in May 2021, \u00a310.6 billion less than a year earlier but \u00a317.3 billion more than in May 2019. Of this, the cost of the government\u2019s coronavirus job support schemes in May, scheduled to close in September 2021, was \u00a35.2 billion, \u00a311.7 billion less than a year earlier.\nIn the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021 (April 2020 to March 2021), the UK public sector borrowed \u00a3299.2 billion, reduced by \u00a34.0 billion from April\u2019s first provisional estimate but still the highest annual borrowing since records began in FYE March 1946. Official forecasts suggest that borrowing could reach \u00a3233.9 billion in FYE March 2022.\nExpressed as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP), public sector net borrowing in FYE March 2021 was 14.3%, the highest such ratio since the end of World War Two, when it was 15.2% in FYE March 1946.\nThe recent substantial increase in borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt, which currently stands at 99.2% of GDP, the highest ratio since the 99.5% recorded in March 1962.\n", "id": 484}, {"document": "There were 615,557 live births in 2020 and 146,574 in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021, both a decrease of 3.9% vs. 2019 and Quarter 1 2020; this follows the trend observed in recent years.\nIn December 2020, January and February 2021, the fertility rates for each month decreased while the fertility rate in March 2021 increased.\nThe total fertility rate in 2020 was an estimated 1.58 children per woman and 1.53 in Quarter 1 2021; this is in line with the recent trend of a decreasing total fertility rate each year since 2012 (at 1.93).\nThere were 2,429 stillbirths in 2020 (167 fewer than 2019) and 618 stillbirths in Quarter 1 2021 (three more than Quarter 1 2020).\nStillbirth rates between March 2020 and March 2021 were, for most months, below the five-year average.\n\u201cIn the months of December 2020 and January 2021 we saw relatively steep decreases in monthly fertility rates, when compared with the same months a year ago, 8.1% and 10.2% respectively. Live births occurring in these months relate to live births that would have mostly been conceived during the first lockdown in 2020, suggesting there was no baby boom as a result of the restrictions first put in place for COVID-19.\n\u201cWe saw a 1.7% increase in the monthly fertility rate in March 2021 when compared with March 2020, which mostly translate to live births conceived when lockdown restrictions were beginning to be eased in summer 2020.\u201d\nPeter Synowiec, Vital Statistics Outputs Branch, Office for National Statistics. \nFollow Vital Statistics Outputs Branch on Twitter @SarahCaul_ONS\n\n!\n\nThis bulletin uses NHS births notifications data in England and Wales to provide more timely estimates of births during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. For more information please see Section 6: Data quality and sources. \n\n\n\nBased on birth notification data, there were 151,104 live births that occurred in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) of 2020 in England and Wales which brings the total number of live births in 2020 to 615,557. With 3.9% fewer live births than in 2019 (640,635) it was the fifth annual decrease in a row. \nThis downward trend continued in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) of 2021, there were 146,574 live births in England and Wales; a decrease of 3.9% compared with the same period in 2020 and a 18.6% decrease since the most recent peak in 2012.\nIn our provisional births release analysing births occurring between January and September 2020, we estimated the total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.60 children per woman. For all births occurring in 2020, the TFR was 1.58 children per woman. The decrease compared with our original estimate was driven by a fall in live births in December 2020. \nBased on births occurring in the first quarter of 2021, we estimate the TFR to be 1.53 children per woman. This continues a downward trend in the TFR (Figure 1). As the 2021 TFR is only based on one quarter of births data, we will continue to monitor changes throughout the year.\nAlthough not directly comparable to our final annual birth statistics these provisional TFRs could suggest we will see the lowest TFR ever recorded once final 2020 data are compiled later this year.\nWhen compared with the same months in previous years, monthly fertility rates in December 2020, January and February 2021 continued to decline with steeper decreases being seen in December 2020 (8.1%) and January 2021 (10.2%) in line with the decrease in numbers of births for these months (Figure 2). Live births occurring in these months will relate mostly to live births that were conceived in the first lockdown. \nIn contrast, the fertility rate in March 2021 increased by 1.7% when compared with March 2020, this was the first increase since March 2016. This period relates to live births that were likely to be conceived in June 2020 when lockdown restrictions were beginning to be eased. \nIn 2020, there were 2,429 stillbirths and the stillbirth rate was 3.9 per 1,000 births. During Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020, there were 592 stillbirths, a slight decrease from 606 stillbirths in Quarter 3 (Jul to Sep). The stillbirth rate has remained fairly stable over the last two quarters of 2020, increasing from 3.8 per 1,000 births in Quarter 3 2020 to 3.9 in Quarter 4 2020. Changes observed are in line with recent trends. \nThere were 618 stillbirths in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021, just three more than in Quarter 1 2020. As a result, the stillbirth rate increased from 3.9 stillbirths per 1,000 total births in 2020 to 4.2 in 2021 so far. Split by month of occurrence since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began, stillbirth rates between March 2020 and March 2021 were below the five-year average; with the exceptions of November 2020 and January 2021 (Figure 3). \nWe note the relatively high stillbirth rate in January 2021 and that it coincides with the height of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in England and Wales. However, there are relatively low numbers of stillbirths each month, and the stillbirth rate in January is just within the plausible range that we might expect to see from random variation. For context, there were 226 stillbirths in January 2021, compared with 207 in January 2020. \nIn our previous release, we explored other variables such as gestational age, birthweight or type of place of birth. We have explored these variables with the Quarter 1 2021 provisional data and found them to follow similar patterns. The data can be found in our downloadable data tables.\n\nProvisional births in England and Wales: Quarter 1 2021 Dataset | Released 24 June 2021 Provisional figures for births occurring between January and March from 2011 to 2021 in England and Wales including live births by month, birthweight, gestational age, place of birth and stillbirths by month and gestational age.Provisional births in England and Wales: 2020 Dataset | Released 24 June 2021 Provisional figures for births occurring annually in England and Wales including live births by month, birthweight, gestational age, place of birth and stillbirths by month and gestational age. \n\n\nTraditionally, our birth statistics for England and Wales are derived from information recorded when births are registered as part of the civil registration process. \nBirth registrations in England and Wales have been delayed because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We are monitoring registrations regularly and are working to ensure that our final birth registration data are as complete as possible before publication. \nIn this release we have used NHS birth notification data to provide more timely estimates of births in England and Wales. The birth notification is a document completed by the doctor or midwife present at the birth.\nThe NHS birth notification figures presented are based on births that occurred between October 2020 and March 2021 and update the data to September 2020 released in December 2020. To make direct comparisons over time, we have compared these figures with birth notification figures for previous years. The statistics in this release are provisional and are not directly comparable with other releases which are derived using birth registrations. \nFor more information on data sources and quality, please see sections 2 and 10 of our provisional births: 2020 release, which contains information on NHS birth notifications and our fertility rate adjustment methodology. \n", "summary": "No baby boom following initial restrictions for COVID-19\nThe number of live births during 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 indicate that there was no baby boom as a result of the restrictions first put in place for the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nDuring 2020 there were 615,557 live births followed by 146,574 live births in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) of 2021. This is a decrease of 3.9% when compared with 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. This follows the trend of a decline in births observed in recent years.\nThe total fertility rate in 2020 was an estimated 1.58 children per woman and 1.53 in the first quarter of 2021; this is in line with the recent trend of a decreasing total fertility rate.\nIn December 2020 and January 2021, monthly fertility rates decreased steeply when compared with the same months a year ago at 8.2% and 10.1% respectively. Births in these months would have been mostly conceived during the first lockdown in 2020, suggesting there wasn\u2019t a baby boom as a result of restrictions.\nIn March 2021, roughly nine months after the easing of lockdown restrictions in Summer 2020, there was an increase of 1.7% in the monthly fertility rate.\nThere were 2,429 stillbirths in 2020 (167 fewer than 2019) and 618 stillbirths in Quarter 1 2021 (three more than the first quarter in 2020). Stillbirth rates between March 2020 and March 2021 were, for most months, below the five-year average.\n", "id": 487}, {"document": "The population of the UK at mid-year 2020 was estimated to be 67.1 million, an increase of about 284,000 (0.4%) since mid-year 2019.\nIn the year to mid-2020, there were 669,000 deaths; this is the most in a mid-year reference period since 1986, and 13% higher than in the year to mid-2019, reflecting the impact of wave one of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe number of births in mid-2020 was 701,000, the lowest number of births since 2003 and a continuation of the trend in fewer births seen over recent years.\nIn the year to mid-2020, we estimate that 622,000 people immigrated to the UK while 375,000 emigrated; this makes net international migration 247,000.\nIn the year to mid-2020, there were around 11% fewer internal moves than in the previous year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on mobility from March 2020.\nWe estimate the population grew in 294 out of the 374 local authorities of the UK in the year to mid-2020, despite the effects of the pandemic and a slowing of national population growth in this period.\n\n!\n\nThe estimates presented cover the period up to 30 June 2020 and so only describe some of the impacts of the early part of the pandemic on the UK population.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s population continues to grow, albeit at the slowest rate in two decades, surpassing 67 million for the first time. However, the 12 months to June 2020 can be broken into two clear parts. The first eight months, when births, deaths and migration patterns were similar to trends seen in recent years, and the four months from March, when the first wave of coronavirus hit. Some of the clearest impacts of the pandemic can be seen in the increase in the number of deaths and reduction in the number of moves made within the UK.\u201d\nNeil Park, Population Estimates Unit, Office for National Statistics\nFollow the ONS Centre for Ageing and Demography on Twitter @RichPereira_ONS.\nWe estimate the population of the UK in mid-2020 was 67.1 million (67,081,234 with a confidence interval of plus or minus 0.2%). We estimate that the population of the UK continued to grow in the year to mid-2020 but at the slowest rate since 2001 (0.4%). \nThe slowing of the growth rate in this period is largely from the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on mortality. The number of deaths in mid-2020 was around 67,000 higher than the average for the previous five years and at the highest level in the last 34 years (since the year to mid-1986). In addition, the number of births recorded in mid-2020 was the lowest since mid-2003, and around 56,000 fewer than the average for the last five years. \nIn the year to mid-2020, more international immigrants and fewer international emigrants meant an increase in net international migration compared with the previous year. The drivers of change in the UK population in mid-2020 are set out in Table 1.\nThe 12 months of population change covered by this release encompasses two distinct periods. The first, from July 2019 to mid-March 2020, was characterised by continuations of trends in fertility, mortality, and an increase in net international migration. The second period, from mid-March 2020 to June 2020, was characterised by a sharp increase in deaths and a low level of net outward international migration. In Section 11, we describe more fully the events covered by these estimates.\nFigure 1 shows that the current level of growth is at its lowest since 2001, representing a fall in a recent trend of high growth, between 0.5 and 0.8%, from mid-2004 to mid-2019. Despite the decline in the rate of population change, it was still higher than in any year between mid-1972 and mid-2001.\nThe interactive map in Figure 2 shows the overall change in population, and components of change for the year to mid-2020 and mid-2019 for each local authority in the UK. \nTo use this interactive tool, select a component of change from the drop-down menu to view its impact on the population estimates at local authority level. For deaths, this shows there were more deaths in the year to mid-2020 than mid-2019 across almost all areas of the country. \n\n!\n\nEstimates presented cover the period up to 30 June 2020 and so only describe some of the impacts of the early part of the pandemic on the UK population. All population estimates are subject to statistical uncertainty. A summary of the available quality information for population estimates is provided in Section 15: Measuring the data.\n\n\n\nChanges in local populations can be driven by international migration, internal migration, births and deaths. Despite the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and a slowing of national population growth in the year to mid-2020, in this period, we estimate the population grew in 294 out of the 374 local authorities of the UK. \nThe areas with the highest rates of population growth from mid-2019 to mid-2020 were predominantly areas of London such as City of London (12.5%), Camden (3.5%) and Westminster (3.3%). In contrast, the areas that saw the greatest decrease in population were Lambeth (negative 1.3%), West Suffolk (negative 1.0%) and Inverclyde (negative 1.0%). \nView more information for local areas on deaths, births, natural change in the population, people moving into and out of the UK, and people moving within the UK in each of the following sections. The Analysis of Population Estimates tool published as part of this release provides access to detailed information on population change for local authority areas, regions and countries within the UK.\nIn May 2021 the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) published a review into population estimates and projections. This review highlighted that at the national level, the approach taken by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is fit for purpose and is supported by expert advice from demography and academic partners, but that at the subnational level, the accuracy of estimates is variable because of factors such as the size and mobility of the population in a given area. Further details on our response to this review can be found in Section 12.\nThe number of deaths in the year to mid-2020, was 669,000. This reflects a 12.8% (around 76,000) increase in the number of deaths from the previous year. For the UK as a whole, the year to mid-2020 saw the highest number of deaths since the year to mid-1986, 34 years before. The major factor in this increase was the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with over 55,000 deaths involving COVID-19 in the year to mid-2020. In the calendar year of 2020, there were 90,000 deaths involving COVID-19 across the UK. More information on deaths involving COVID-19 by month of registration is available.\nThere were other contributory factors to the increase in the number of deaths. These include:\nan increased level of excess winter mortality (19.6% higher than in the previous winter)\nthe number of older people in the population has continued to increase; in mid-2020 there were 12.5 million people aged 65 years and over in the UK, compared with just 10.3 million a decade earlier\nIn the year to mid-2020, there were a higher number of deaths in 366 of the 374 local authorities in the UK. The increase in deaths was not evenly distributed across the UK, with the South West of England seeing a 7.8% annual increase and London seeing a 21.1% increase. \nDespite the impact of the pandemic, the highest rates of death were still in areas with older populations, often located in coastal and rural areas (see Figure 2). However, many of the largest increases in deaths were in areas of London such as Harrow (37.6%), Brent (31.2%), Haringey (28.7%) and Newham (28.4%), showing that infections of COVID-19 were highest in densely populated major cities during the first wave of the pandemic. \nHowever, other areas also saw large increases in deaths in the year to mid-2020, such as South Lakeland which saw a 30.5% annual increase in deaths. This is likely due to South Lakeland having a large population of people aged over 65 and is an indicator of the uneven impact of wave one of the pandemic on different parts of the UK. \nView the interactive tool in Section 3 to explore the data by local authority.\nThe number of births across the UK continued to fall in the year to mid-2020. The 701,000 births in the year to mid-2020 are the fewest in any year since 2003, despite the population being 7.4 million higher. The number of births peaked at 813,000 in mid-2012, around 112,000 more births than in the year to mid-2020. The decrease since mid-2012 reflects reductions in fertility rates since then.\n\n!\n\nBirth registrations were suspended during the early part of the pandemic, and this affected how the Office for National Statistics (ONS) collated the data. We estimate that the data in this release cover at least 99.7% of births in the reference period.\n\n\n\nHowever, the decrease in the number of births cannot be attributed to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as all the births in this period were from conceptions that predate the pandemic. \nThe number of births continued to fall across much of the UK reflecting the continued decline in fertility rates seen over recent years. In the year to mid-2020, 79.7% of local authorities in the UK had fewer birth registrations than in the previous year. The combination of fewer births and more deaths means that natural change (the number of births minus deaths) was lower in all but eight UK local authorities in mid-2020 than in the previous year.\nFor more information on trends in fertility, view our publications on:\nfertility analysis based on calendar year data, for example: Births in England and Wales: summary tables\nVital statistics in the UK: births, deaths and marriages\nView the interactive tool in Section 3 to explore the data by local authority.\nIn mid-2020, natural change (the difference between the number of births and the number of deaths) was 31,000 (Figure 3). Largely the result of the increase in deaths, natural change in mid-2020 was lower than the previous year (128,000 in year to mid-2019) and is at its lowest in at least 38 years. \nFigure 3 shows that population growth is well below the average levels between mid-2005 and mid-2016 and is continuing its recent decline. The slower growth in recent years is influenced by lower international migration and, particularly this year, much lower natural change (the balance between births and deaths).\nView the interactive tool in Section 3 to explore the data by local authority.\nWe estimate that 622,000 people immigrated to the UK in mid-2020, while 375,000 emigrated and moved to other countries outside of the UK. This gives net international migration of 247,000.\nBroadly, international migration in the year to mid-2020 can be split into two distinct phases. In the period to March 2020, there were relatively high levels of net inward international migration and then from March 2020 onwards this flow became a small net outflow. The combination of these two phases leads to net international migration that is around 20,000 higher than in the year to mid-2019 and lower than the average level of net international migration seen in the past five years (average 281,000). \n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on International Passenger Survey (IPS) data up to March 2020 and modelled migration estimates for the period after March 2020 when the IPS was suspended because of coronavirus (COVID-19). Figures in this release are therefore methodologically inconsistent with previous figures. View the QMI for more detail.\n\n\n\nIn the period to June 2020, international migration to the UK was higher than in the previous year, in part because of an increase in students arriving to study in the UK from abroad during this period. In keeping with trends of recent years, the areas with the highest estimates of international immigration were predominantly areas of London such as Westminster and Camden, large major cities such as Birmingham and Manchester, and university towns such as Coventry and Oxford.\nA similar pattern is seen with international emigration, with major cities such as Manchester and Birmingham, London boroughs such as Camden and Lambeth, and university towns such as Oxford and Cambridge all having relatively high estimates of international emigration. \nThe majority of the international migration captured in the current estimates occurred prior to the start of the pandemic in the UK and the travel restrictions that were implemented in March 2020.\nView the interactive tool in Section 3 to explore the data by local authority.\nIn the 12-month period to mid-2020, an estimated 3.2 million people moved between local authorities in the UK, a decrease in internal migration of 11.5% on the previous year (3.7 million to mid-2019).\n\n!\n\nThe completeness of internal migration estimates for the year to mid-2020 may have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as movement may not have been accompanied by timely updates to the administrative data used to produce the estimates. View the QMI for more detail.\n\n\n\nOne of the clearest impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on internal migration for the year to mid-2020 was a reduction in the number of moves because of the first national lockdown (implemented across the UK in March 2020), which restricted people moving home.\nFigure 4 shows the change in rate of moves (number of moves divided by population) by single year of age between mid-2019 and mid-2020, along with average change in the last two years. Ordinarily, there is little difference between the rate of moves in one year and in the next. However, for most ages there was a fairly consistent decrease of between 10% and 15% in the rate of moves made; the main exception was for the 19 to 23 years age group, which saw a much smaller decrease. For this age group, a high proportion of moves are associated with moves to and from higher education. Typically these moves occur between July and October and so were not affected by the pandemic.\nDespite the impact of the pandemic, the overall geographical pattern of internal migration flows in the year to mid-2020 appears to be broadly consistent with previous years, reflecting that around nine months of the year were not affected. \nIn the year to mid-2020, around 101,000 more people left London for elsewhere in the UK than moved in (Figure 5); this is consistent with the average for the previous three years (101,000). However, the consistency in net flows masks a decrease in the overall number of moves both into and out of London, which reflects the decrease in moves nationally. In the year to mid-2020, 320,000 people left London and 219,000 moved in (8% and 14% fewer than in mid-2019).\nSimilarly, across the UK, the net flows were broadly consistent with previous years\u2019 data (Figure 6). Most English regions and UK countries that saw net inward or outward migration in mid-2019 had similar flows in mid-2020 with the exception of Northern Ireland and Yorkshire and The Humber. \nAdditionally, more people arrived than departed in the East and South East in comparison with previous years; these trends are largely seen from people moving out of London. However, there were still local authorities within these regions that had a net flow that differed from that of the region, demonstrating considerable within-region variation. \nThe pattern of moves within the UK are largely similar to that of previous years as most of the year (eight months) was unaffected by the pandemic. It is reasonable to assume that the majority of moves were made over the course of the first eight months because after March 2020, government restrictions on movement were introduced as a result of the pandemic. \nThe data here would reflect for example, flows out of local authorities to student areas before the pandemic began. However, following the temporary closure of universities across England and Wales, large numbers of students left their place of study and returned to their parental home or other residence. If they did not register with a new GP after making this move, then their move would not be captured by the administrative data sources used to compile internal migration. \nView the interactive tool in Section 3 to explore the data by local authority.\nWhile all four countries of the UK saw population increases in the year to mid-2020 there has been a divergence between the rates of population change. \nIn the year to mid-2019 all four countries of the UK had population increases of between 0.45% and 0.64%. In the year to mid-2020, England and Wales have continued to grow at a similar rate while the populations of Scotland and Northern Ireland have grown more slowly (at 0.05% and 0.1% respectively). Table 2 shows the populations and growth rates for each country of the UK.\nAll four countries saw their rate of population growth slow because of a combination of a higher number of deaths and a lower number of births. Figure 7 shows how the rates (per 1,000 population) of births, deaths, migration and population changed for each country, between the year to mid-2019 and the year to mid-2020. \nFor Northern Ireland, where the rate of population increase fell from 6.4 per thousand in mid-2019 to 1 per thousand in mid-2020, internal and international migration were responsible for most of the slower rate of increase. \nIn Scotland, which saw the second largest decrease in population growth rate, the main driver of slower population growth is a decrease in international migration. \nIn the year to mid-2020 the population of Wales increased at the fastest rate of the UK countries, reflecting higher net migration from other countries and from other parts of the UK.\nUnrelated to the pandemic, all four countries also saw a continuation in the trend of a decreasing number of births.\nThe age composition of the UK population is determined by the patterns of births, deaths and migration that have taken place in previous years. The result is that the broad age groups in the UK population are changing at different rates, with the number of those aged 65 years and over growing faster than those under 65 years. Similarly, whereas most areas of the UK have become older in the year to mid-2020, median age was lower in some areas of the UK compared with mid-2019. \nThe median age of the UK population increased from 40.3 years in mid-2019 to 40.4 years in mid-2020. Table 3 shows that of the countries of the UK, Wales had the highest median age (42.4 years), followed by Scotland (42.1 years), England (40.2 years) and Northern Ireland (39.2 years). \nIn the North East of England, the median age fell from 41.8 to 41.7 years driven by increased numbers of deaths and increases in net international and internal migration. \nIn Wales, the combination of higher numbers of deaths (mostly of older age) and increased international and internal migration (generally of younger adults and their families) meant that the median age fell from 42.5 to 42.4 years. \nThe South West (22.4%), Wales (21.1%), and the North East (20.1%) were the areas with the highest percentage of people aged 65 years and over. Whereas the South West (3.1%), South East (2.8%) and East of England (2.8%), had the highest proportion of people aged 85 years and over. \nThe population pyramids in Figure 8 illustrate how numbers of older people within the population can change year on year because of variations in cohort size. Notably, the large cohort of people born around 1946 and 1947 are now aged around 73 years.\nThe population estimates presented in this release reflect the population of the UK at the end of June 2020 towards the end of the first wave of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. During the period between March and June 2020, the UK was in lockdown for much of the time and these restrictions had direct impacts on population change at both the national and subnational level. Events that affected the components of population change and that feed into the population estimates include:\na \u201cfirst wave\u201d of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic occurred during the period up to June 2020\nmoving home within the UK became more difficult from 23 March 2020, however, many moves for study had already occurred before the pandemic\ninternational immigration became more difficult, with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advising against overseas travel from 17 March 2020\nareas with the other populations we measure, such as prisoners or members of armed forces, had fewer people joining those populations in the months up to June 2020\nEstimates of the mid-year population reflect changes in the net position of long-term international migration (LTIM) between July 2019 and June 2020. Historically, estimates of LTIM are sourced from the Office for National Statistics\u2019 (ONS\u2019) Migration Statistics Quarterly Report using information on UK arrivals and departures collected via the International Passenger Survey (IPS). However, measures of LTIM feeding population estimates in mid-2020 were affected by the suspension of the IPS in mid-March following the restrictions imposed during the pandemic. \nTo overcome the lack of IPS data from March to June 2020, measures of LTIM were modelled to estimate UK international migration. \nThe migration estimates that form the input into mid-year 2020 population estimates are presented within Quarterly Long Term International Migration Estimates July 2019 to June 2020. A description of how each quarter\u2019s data is constructed can be found in our methodology guide. \nIn April 2021 an early indicator of the population of the UK was published. This suggested a slightly higher population than shown in this release (by around 32,000). The main difference is caused by a slightly higher estimate of net international migration being used in that release and the unavailability, at the time, of data on home and foreign armed forces personnel.\nThe mid-2021 population estimates for England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be based primarily on the results of the 2021 censuses adjusted for births, deaths and migration in the period between census day and mid-year. Mid-2021 population estimates for Scotland will be rolled forward from 2020 as the census in Scotland is taking place in March 2022. \nFollowing the publication of the Census 2021 results for England and Wales, we will conduct reconciliation work to understand how and why the estimates based on Census 2021 differ from those based on the mid-year estimates rolled from 2011. The insights gained will be used to improve the production of future population estimates and will result in a revised back series of population estimates for the period 2012 to 2020, which will increase the coherence between the census and mid-year estimates. \nThe estimates of long-term international migration included in this release are the best possible given the available data sources. However, they remain experimental, and users should be aware that they are likely to be revised as new sources of information become available, and as we refine our methodology for measuring migration. For more information on our future plans for improving migration statistics, please see population and migration statistics system transformation \u2013 recent updates. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) intends to publish an update on our progress to develop admin-based population estimates and understand the impact of the pandemic on administrative data sources at the end of 2021.\nIn May 2021, the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) published a review of population estimates and projections. The review identified that we use internationally recognised methods and sources as the basis for population estimates and projections that are fit for purpose for national level estimates.\u202f However, the review also identified the need to keep methods current and responsive especially at some lower levels where there is more variability in the data. We are already progressing work in this area as we consider how best to meet these recommendations, and we will report back to the OSR about our plans while continuing to gather feedback on them more broadly.\u202f We recognise the need for:\ndevelopment work to keep these sources current and responsive\ndeveloping how we work and engaging with users of our statistics, particularly at a local level\nplanning how we move to Census 2021-based estimates, and take on board improvements from the population and migration statistics transformation programme\nA more detailed response to the review is planned for July 2021.\n\nEstimates of the population for the UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland  Dataset | Released 25 June 2021  National and subnational mid-year population estimates for the UK and its constituent countries by administrative area, age and sex (including components of population change, median age and population density).Analysis of population estimates tool for UK  Dataset | Released on 25 June 2021  Interactive analysis of estimated population change for England and Wales, by geography, age and sex.

However, an increase of 284,000 since June 2019 means growth had slowed to 0.4% - the slowest rate since 2001.\nThe slowing of the growth rate was due primarily to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

It should be noted that the analysis on the characteristics and behaviours of those testing positive in this bulletin is for a different time period than the headline figures presented in the most recent bulletin. The reference periods for the various analyses are clearly stated at the start of each section, as well as further information on what the analysis covers. More information about the methods used for our models is available in our\u00a0methodology article.\nThis section provides modelled estimates on positivity rates by adults in patient-facing and not in patient-facing healthcare job roles for the UK.\u00a0Patient-facing healthcare job roles include working in healthcare establishments such as hospitals, and do not include job roles in social care or care homes. The models used to produce positivity rates for adults in patient-facing and not in patient-facing job roles include only swab test results from individuals aged 16 to 74 years. Those not working are included within the group not in patient-facing healthcare job roles. This analysis covers the time period between 21 September 2020 and 14 June 2021.\nIn the weeks prior to 14 June 2021, the percentage of the population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK continued to be low for those in patient-facing healthcare job roles, but has increased in adults not in patient-facing healthcare job roles.\u200b This is after a peak in both groups in January 2021, which was more pronounced for adults in patient-facing job roles than those not in patient-facing healthcare job roles.\nEstimated percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 on nose and throat swabs by adults in patient-facing and not in patient-facing healthcare job roles, UK, 21 September 2020 to 14 June 2021\nDownload the data\nThis section looks at how often individuals are reporting social contact (either socially distanced or physical contact) with other people outside their own household, regardless of whether they have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). We asked individuals how many people aged 17 years and under, 18 to 69 years, and 70 years and over, outside their household, they have had contact with up to seven days prior to each visit. \"Contact\" refers to either of the following:\nsocially distanced contact - direct contact with social distancing only\nphysical contact - physical contact, such as a handshake or personal care, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)\nThis analysis covers the time period between 20 September 2020 and 12 June 2021 in England, and 29 November 2020 and 12 June 2021 for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The analysis for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland starts at a later date because data collection for these countries started at a later date.\nFurther information on the schedule for school re-openings can be viewed for\u00a0England,\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland. Information on lockdown easing can be viewed for\u00a0England,\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland.\nWe have produced estimates that have been weighted to be representative of the total population in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Analysis includes all people taking part in the survey and we present contact analysis for school-age children (age two years to school Year 11) and adults (school Year 12 and above). We report the number of contacts in the following groups:\n0 (no reported contact)\n1 to 5 (reported contacts)\n6 to 10 (reported contacts)\n11 to 20 (reported contacts)\n21 or more (reported contacts)\nWe present the proportion of school-age children reporting each category of socially distanced contact in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in Figure 2.\nAcross all four UK countries, the proportion of socially distanced contacts school-age children had with those aged under 70 years has been increasing since March 2021, with a dip occurring in mid-April 2021 in England, Wales and Scotland corresponding to the Easter school holidays. The increases from March 2021 correspond to the full or phased re-opening of schools in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, dependant on policies for each country.\nThe proportion of socially distanced contacts school-age children had with those aged 70 and over has increased gradually since mid-January 2021 in England, and since March 2021 in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThere is a consistent trend over time and across all nations with school-age children reporting to have more socially distanced contacts with those aged under 18 years than with those aged 18 to 69 years or aged 70 years and over.\nProportion of school-age children by number of socially distanced contacts with different age groups, UK, 20 September 2020 to 12 June 2021\nDownload the data\nWe present the proportion of adults reporting each category of socially distanced contact in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in Figure 3.\nAcross all four UK countries, the proportion of socially distanced contacts across all age groups for adults has been increasing since March 2021. Adults also consistently reported more socially distanced contacts with those aged 18 to 69 years than with people under the age of 18 years or 70 years and over across all four UK countries over the time period studied.\nProportion of adults by number of socially distanced contacts with different age groups, UK, 20 September 2020 to 12 June 2021\nDownload the data\nAmong school-age children, the trends in physical contacts are very similar to socially distanced contact trends across the UK, with increases in contacts from March 2021 onwards.\nAs with socially distanced contacts, school-age children consistently reported having more physical contacts with those aged under 18 years than with those aged 18 to 69 years or 70 years and over in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nAmong adults, trends in physical contacts over time are also very similar to socially distanced contact trends across the UK, with increases in contacts from March 2021 onwards, although the number of physical contacts was lower.\nAdults in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland reported having consistently more physical contacts with those aged 18 to 69 years than with those aged under 18 years or aged 70 years and over in the time period studied.\nAdditional information on the proportions of physical contacts by school-age children and adults can be found in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nOur findings are generally similar to those reported in the\u00a0Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), which examines the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain. The most recent OPN bulletin reported that among adults in Great Britain, from 16 to 20 June 2021:\nThe proportion of adults reporting meeting up indoors (44% this week, 46% last week) or outdoors (60% this week, 63% last week) with someone not in their household, childcare or support bubble in the past seven days decreased slightly this week following previous increases in these proportions as lockdown restrictions eased.\nThis analysis considers individuals with any strong positive test (including repeated positive tests) that had a Ct value less than 30 between 1 December 2020 and 14 June 2021 in the UK. This analysis considers all symptoms reported at visits within 35 days of the first positive test of the episode, and at each visit we ask about symptoms in the last seven days. This includes symptoms reported even when there is a negative test within this timeframe or a positive test with a higher Ct value. The strength of the test is determined by how quickly the virus is detected, measured by a cycle threshold (Ct) value. The lower the Ct value, the higher the viral load and stronger the positive test. We look at strong positive test results with a Ct of less than 30 to exclude the possibility that symptoms are not identified because we pick up individuals very early or later on in their infection. More details on this analysis can be found in\u00a0Section 9.\nIndividuals taking part in the survey were asked at each visit whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms1\u00a0in the seven days before they were tested, and also separately whether they felt that they had symptoms compatible with a coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in the last seven days.\nIn Figure 5 we have categorised reported symptoms into the following:\nany: any specific self-reported symptom, including cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste, loss of smell, myalgia, fatigue, sore throat, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting; or any symptom compatible with COVID-19\nclassic: cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste, loss of smell\ngastrointestinal (GI): abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea\nloss of taste or smell only\nTo date, 80% of positive cases in June\u00b2 2021 and 46% of positive cases in May 2021 were Delta variant compatible. Prior to this very few Delta compatible cases were identified. This means that any change between May and June when compared with previous months may be because the Delta variant has a different symptoms profile to the Alpha variant. In addition, when the percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 is increasing, as it has been recently, the survey is likely to identify more people closer to the start of their infection with lower Ct values. We have recently seen a decrease in Ct values, indicating an increase in strong positive test results at the start of infection, which may result in more people reporting symptoms.\nThis analysis is based on all individuals who test positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test (Ct <30) and considers what percentage of these individuals reported symptoms within 35 days of the first positive test in the episode. \u200b\nIn June 2021\u00b2, 61% (95% confidence interval: 52% to 69%) of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the UK reported symptoms. The confidence intervals are wider because of lower numbers of people testing positive in our survey from March 2021 onwards. Symptoms reported were more likely to be \"classic\" symptoms than gastrointestinal or loss of taste or smell only.\nPercentage of people with symptoms, including only those who have strong positive tests (Ct less than 30), UK, 1 December 2020 to 14 June 2021\nDownload the data\nPercentage of people with symptoms, including only those who have strong positive tests (Ct less than 30), UK, 1 December 2020 to 14 June 2021\nDownload the data\nFigure 6 shows that the most commonly reported symptoms in the UK have consistently been cough, headache and fatigue.

This is after a peak in both groups in January 2021, which was more pronounced for adults in patient-facing job roles than those not in patient-facing healthcare job roles. Patient-facing healthcare job roles include working in healthcare establishments such as hospitals, and do not include job roles in social care or care homes.\nIn June 2021, 61% of people in the UK who tested positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test reported symptoms within 35 days of the test.
