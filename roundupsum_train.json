The fall in the private sector reflects the different job types across each sector and the extent they have been impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nWhile pay held up for most employees, there are groups of employees who fared less well, most notably younger employees, the lowest-paid part-time employees, and those working in accommodation and food services. Employees aged 16 to 17 and 18 to 21 years were more impacted than other employees in terms of hours paid for, which fell by 5.4% and 3.7% respectively compared with 2019.\nThe effect that the CJRS had in April is clear. Employees being placed on the scheme prevented paid hours falling at the rate shown by the actual number of hours worked, as reported in the Labour Force Survey (LFS). A subsequent downward pressure on weekly earnings from a fall in hours was largely suppressed. \nAcross all industry sectors, paid hours fell by 1.5% from 2019 and median weekly pay was unchanged. However, in accommodation and food services, paid hours fell by 12% and weekly pay fell by 18.1% compared with 2019.\nYounger workers and those working in accommodation and food services were more likely to be furloughed and were also less likely to have their pay topped up by their employer when compared with other furloughed employees.\n", "id": 508}, {"document": "placeholder", "summary": "Also published in the last week\n - Coronavirus and the economic impacts on the UK: 5 November 2020\n - Labour and multi-factor productivity measures, UK: April to June 2020\n - UK trade: goods and services publication tables\n\n", "id": 509}, {"document": "placeholder", "summary": "Regional differences in local COVID-19 alert system\nMore than three-quarters (77%) of adults in the North West of England reported they have been living under the most stringent local coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown measures.\nThe government\u2019s local COVID-19 alert system was introduced on 12 October, 2020 and classified local areas under a \u201dtier\u201d system. \nDifferent rules applied in different parts of the country for meeting up with others outside their household or support bubble, of which the majority of the North West was in Tier 3. \nA second national lockdown for England, started on 5 November, before responses for this survey for the period 28 October to 1 November 2020, were collected. \nUnder the alert system, according to the latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), the region with the highest proportion of adults reporting living under Tier 2 restrictions was the North East, with 95%.\nThe South West had the highest proportion (93%) of people reporting they were living in the lowest level of restrictions, Tier 1.\nThis week, we asked adults about the rules that applied where they live.
