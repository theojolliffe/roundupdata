Disabled people were also more likely to think that life would never return to normal (16% of disabled people compared with 10% of non-disabled). \nPeople who were unable to afford an unexpected but necessary \u00a3850 expense, and therefore may be struggling financially, were three times less likely to feel that life was back to normal (4%) than people who could afford it (12%). People unable to afford an expense were also more likely to feel it would take more than a year before life returned to normal (39% compared with 29%). \nParents with dependent children were more likely to feel it would be more than a year before their life returned to normal (39% compared with 29% of non-parents). \nRespondents to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) were asked about their behaviours because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This question was asked at the end of February 2022, when the majority of restrictions and guidance in place in Great Britain to manage the spread of COVID-19 had been lifted. During the response period, self-isolation requirements in England were also removed. \nThe behaviours most commonly reported were frequent hand washing (81%) and wearing face coverings (76%).

Three-quarters (75%) of adults in Great Britain said they still planned to sanitise their hands regularly, two-thirds (64%) planned to cover their faces in shops and 60% planned to avoid crowded places. \nRegardless of restrictions, 45% of people reported avoiding close contact with people they do not live with in February 2022. The same percentage (45%) reported opening windows and doors in enclosed spaces. \nAround a sixth of adults (16%) reported that they were no longer going into school or work when experiencing cold or flu symptoms. This rose to 23% among parents of dependent children and fell to 14% among non-parents. \nAround a quarter of people (26%) said they were avoiding public transport. This reflects trends seen elsewhere, with data from the Department for Transport (DfT) showing public transport use is yet to return to pre-coronavirus levels. \nUse of private forms of transport is recovering faster than public, according to DfT. Over the week commencing 14 February 2022, cycling was at 97% of pre-coronavirus levels in England. On 17 February 2022, use of cars was at 91% of pre-coronavirus levels in Great Britain, while use of national rail was at 73%. Buses outside of London were at 72% of pre-coronavirus levels. In London, use of the tube was at 64% of pre-coronavirus levels, and use of London buses was at 80% of pre-coronavirus levels. \nAround a third of the OPN respondents (35%) reported they were doing more shopping online because of COVID-19. Online sales remained higher than pre-coronavirus levels, according to Retail Sales Index data. \nIn January 2022, online sales made up a quarter (25%) of all retail sales. This was the lowest proportion since March 2020, but still 5 percentage points higher than before the pandemic.\nIn February 2022, disabled people were more likely than non-disabled people to feel that life will never return to normal (16% compared with 10%). This trend has been consistent throughout the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Disabled people were also less likely than non-disabled people to think life had already returned to normal (6% compared with 11%). \nPrevious analysis of the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on disabled people has shown that between March 2020 and December 2021 disabled people were more likely to report feeling very uncomfortable or uncomfortable about leaving their homes. Disabled people also reported a greater impact on their wellbeing, as well as access to healthcare and treatment for non-coronavirus-related issues. \nThese effects on daily life were reflected in the behaviours disabled people adopted because of the pandemic. In February 2022, the majority of disabled people (67%) reported they were avoiding crowded places, compared with 54% of non-disabled people. \nDisabled people were also more likely than non-disabled people to avoid close contact with those they do not live with (57% of disabled people compared with 41% of non-disabled) and spend more time at home because of coronavirus (63% of disabled people compared with 49% of non-disabled). \nDisabled people were less likely to have spent more time outdoors because of the pandemic (8% of disabled people compared with 16% of non-disabled people). However, they used digital technology more for socialising, hobbies, and activities than non-disabled people (31% compared with 21%). \nDownload the data for adults adopting behaviours because of the coronavirus by disability (XLSX, 10KB)\nA third of adults aged 16 to 24 years (33%) reported avoiding crowded places, compared with half of those aged 25 to 34 years (50%) and 71% of those aged 70 years and over.\nLess than two-thirds of people aged 16 to 24 years (61%) wore face coverings, compared with 85% of those aged 70 years and over. The proportion of people frequently using hand gel or hand washing fell to 69% among those aged 16 to 24 years and rose to 89% among those aged 70 years and over. \nAlmost a tenth (9%) of those aged 16 to 24 years were not doing any of the behaviours listed, compared with 2% of those aged 70 years and over. \nYounger age groups (those aged 16 to 24 and 25 to 34 years) were less likely than older age groups to avoid close contact with those they do not live with. Around a fifth (19%) of adults aged 16 to 24 years avoided close contact with people they do not live with compared with 61% of those aged 70 years and over. \nAlmost one in six (15%) of those aged 16 to 24 years think their life has already returned to normal; this was significantly higher than those aged 25 to 34 years (5%) and those aged 70 years and over (6%). \nIn late February, women were more likely than men to frequently use hand gel or wash hands, open windows or doors in indoor spaces, avoid crowded places, and wear face coverings and avoid public transport because of coronavirus. \nMen were more likely than women to report not doing any behaviours because of coronavirus (6% of men compared with 2% of women). \nDownload the data for adults adopting behaviours because of the coronavirus, by sex (XLSX, 10KB)\nWomen were also more likely than men to report shopping online more (39% of women compared with 31% of men) and spending more time at home (58% of women compared with 48% of men). \nWhile women were more likely than men to adopt behaviours because of coronavirus, men and women\u2019s attitudes towards the return to normal were similar. Women were equally as likely as men to feel that their life has already returned to normal (9%), and there was no significant difference in the proportion of men and women feeling that life would never return to normal or return to normal in over a year. However, women were more likely than men to be unsure when life would return to normal (31% of women and 24% of men). \nOverall, 14% of people said they were spending more time outside because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This fell to 10% among those unable to afford an unexpected but necessary expense of \u00a3850 and rose to 16% among those who could afford one. \nPeople unable to afford an unexpected expense were also less likely to report walking or cycling more (11% of those unable to afford an expense compared with 18% of those who were able to afford one), and working from home (13% compared with 23%). \nPrevious analysis of Time Use Survey data from March and April 2020 showed the amount of time people in higher income households they spent on fitness during lockdown increased, while people in low-income households saw no change. \nThose on lower incomes were also more likely to have continued working outside the home compared with patterns before the coronavirus pandemic. \nDownload the data for adults adopting behaviours because of coronavirus, by ability to afford an expense (XLSX, 10KB)\nThis release contains data and indicators from the Office for National Statistics' (ONS') Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN).

We have used data from the period from 3 to 30 October 2021 in the analysis. The article uses a statistical model to examine which different characteristics of people sampled in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) are associated with those who report having received a vaccine against COVID-19 and those who have not reported having received a vaccine.\nVaccination rates differed considerably by age (Figure 1). For ease of analysis, we grouped ages into three standard age groups: 18- to 34-year-olds, 35- to 64-year-olds and those aged 65 years and over. The difference in vaccination rates by age was largely because vaccines were available to these populations at different times. Vaccine rollout varied between the countries of the UK, but in England, all 65-year-olds were eligible for vaccines based on age alone by 15 February 2021. Those over 35 years of age were eligible by 20 May 2021, and those over 18 years of age by 18 June 2021. Because of the time differences in vaccines being available to the different age groups, there may also be differences in the reasons why people have not been vaccinated, for example, preferences regarding vaccination or lack of access or eligibility.\nThe analysis used reported vaccination status from participants from the Office for National Statistics\u2019 (ONS) Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS). CIS is a large household survey monitoring current COVID-19 infections within private households in the UK. It excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. Participants were asked about demographics, living environment, behaviours, work, and vaccination uptake. Further information on the study design can be found in COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nDaily official government figures provide the recorded actual numbers of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 issued. Our vaccination estimates are likely to be different from the official figures, because they are estimates based on a sample survey of reported vaccine status. In addition, our sampling method for Northern Ireland is different to the other nations, inviting only people who have previously participated in a Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) survey, which could result in a sample of individuals who are more likely to get vaccinated. \nDifferences between official figures and the estimates from this survey may also differ in scale across each of the four UK nations (some survey estimates are closer to the official reported figures than others) because of differences in reporting dates and the inclusion of National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) data for England. We use NIMS data to check our survey data, where participants do not report having received a vaccine in the survey, but are recorded to have done so in the administrative data. Adding this information improves the quality of the data we have for England. NIMS does not cover Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, so we use self-reported vaccination status alone in these countries. This means that vaccination estimates are likely to be lower for these countries because we rely on self-report alone. To make sure that comparisons of other characteristics are not affected by this, we control for region and country in all models. \nIn this analysis two logistic regression models were run for each of the three age groups: 18- to 34-year-olds, 35- to 64-year-olds and those aged 65 years and over. Our outcome was \u201cVaccinated\u201d \u2013 defined as a participant having had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine prior to their visit. We also treated someone as vaccinated if they have been recorded to have received a vaccination in the 21 days following their visit. We included data from the most recent visit per participant in the 28-day period from 3 to 30 October 2021. The models included all participants across the UK. \nBecause characteristics of people are sometimes related, we wanted to estimate the impact of each variable. For example, old people and young people tend to have different health statuses, so when we estimated the impact of health status on vaccination, we needed to control for the impact of age. \nOur first model, Model 1 (the core model), estimated the likelihood of an individual being vaccinated for eight core demographic characteristics:\nModel 1 estimated the total effect of these core demographic characteristics on the likelihood of being vaccinated and included all participants. The model gives the overall effect of these factors and does not try to estimate how much of these overall effects might be explained by other factors such as health status. \nThe model also tested for interactions between the core demographic characteristics, including interactions between those variables that were significant at a 0.001 threshold. For example, we see that the effect of sex changes by age in the 18- to 34- years age group: in this group, younger men were less likely to be vaccinated than younger women, whereas older men in the age group were more likely be vaccinated than older women. The outputs of Model 1, which included all core variables and interactions, are presented in the accompanying dataset. \nThe core variables can affect the likelihood of being vaccinated directly as well as indirectly through other factors like work status, so for the second group of variables, we adjusted for these core demographic variables. Model 2 tested whether other factors that may change over time, such as work status, affected the likelihood of being vaccinated. This means that we can say, for example, that people aged 35 to 64 years were less likely to be vaccinated if they were not working, regardless of where in the UK they lived, or whether they were a man or a woman.\nBecause the core demographic variables were included as controls in Model 2, when looking at results we do not draw conclusions about the core demographic characteristics from Model 1. Work status was included as an additional control in all models testing other factors associated with work.\nHaving tested the different variables, we only included in Model 2 characteristics that predicted whether someone reported being vaccinated independently of the other characteristics, using a technique called backward elimination with a significance threshold of 0.05. The sample was slightly smaller for Model 2 as participants with missing responses to the final variables used could not be included. The models were run for all three age groups and the final significant characteristics that were included in Model 2 were different for each age group. The outputs of Model 2 for each three age groups are presented in the accompanying dataset. \nThis analysis used data from 3 to 30 October 2021 with 36,281 (93.9%) participants vaccinated out of 38,651 participants from across the UK included in the model.\nFigure 2 presents findings from Model 1 for 18- to 34-year-olds.\nKey findings presented in Figure 1 are:\nResults for other characteristics included in the model can be found in the accompanying dataset. \nThe likelihood of being vaccinated against (COVID-19) by core demographic characteristic, 18 to 34-year-olds, UK, 3 to 30 October 2021\nEstimates are subject to uncertainty, given that a sample is only part of the wider population. The model provides 95% confidence intervals around the estimates.\nDeprivation is based on an index of multiple deprivation (IMD) score or equivalent scoring method for the devolved administrations, from 1, which represents most deprived up to 100, which represents least deprived. The odds ratio shows how a 10 unit increase in deprivation score, which is equivalent to 10 percentiles or 1 decile, affects the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19. \nAn odds ratio indicates the likelihood of an individual having received a vaccination against COVID-19 given a particular characteristic or variable. When a characteristic or variable has an odds ratio of one, this means there is neither an increase nor a decrease in the likelihood of the participant having received a vaccination against COVID-19 compared with the reference category. An odds ratio greater than one indicates an increased likelihood of the participant having received a vaccination against COVID-19 compared with the reference category. An odds ratio less than one indicates a decreased likelihood of the participant having received a vaccination against COVID-19 compared with the reference category. \nFor 18- to 34-year-olds, there was statistical evidence of an interaction between age and sex. This means that younger men in this age group were less likely to be vaccinated than younger women. However, this changed with age such that older men in this age group were more likely to be vaccinated than older women.\nThe interaction between age and sex is plotted in Figure 3. The y axis gives predicted probabilities of having been vaccinated calculated at a reference value for other core demographic factors (White ethnicity, household size of one, non-multigenerational household, living in a major urban area, 50th deprivation percentile). The predicted probabilities should not be used as population vaccination rates. Levels of vaccination in the population may be different because of other factors not included in the model and because this model is based on a sample.\nThe predicated probability of being vaccinated against coronavirus (COVID-19) by age and sex, 18 to 34-year-olds, UK, 3 to 30 October 2021 \nProbabilities are subject to uncertainty, given that a sample is only part of the wider population.

Of particular note are:\nUniversity of Oxford \u2013 Emma Pritchard and Sarah Walker\nA confidence interval gives an indication of the degree of uncertainty of an estimate, showing the precision of a sample estimate. The 95% confidence intervals are calculated so that if we repeated the study many times, 95% of the time the true unknown value would lie between the lower and upper confidence limits. A wider interval indicates more uncertainty in the estimate. Overlapping confidence intervals indicate that there may not be a true difference between two estimates.\nFor more information, see our methodology page on statistical uncertainty.\nA coefficient indicates the likelihood of an individual testing positive for COVID-19 given a particular characteristic or variable.

Among those people, 12% said they had considered relocating, mostly to rural or coastal areas. \nHowever, while there has been a general pattern of people moving from urban to rural places in recent years, we do not have any data at this stage that suggest a stronger trend during the pandemic. \nData for annual percentage change in house prices by local authority in January to July 2021 (XLSX, 38KB)\nUK private rents increased by 1.3% in the 12 months to August, rising to 2.0% excluding London. \nThe fastest rates of growth were in the East Midlands (2.7%) and the South West (2.6%), while London was the only region to record a decrease (-0.4%). \nThe RICS UK Residential Market Survey (PDF, 4.8MB) suggests that an imbalance between tenant demand and the supply of lettings could be contributing to the increase in rental prices. \nIn the three months to August 2021, RICS reported that tenant demand was accelerating while landlord instructions remained in decline. \nThe fall in supply of lettings was most widespread in the Midlands, the East of England and the South West. \nIt could be that some landlords are trying to capitalise on domestic tourism through holiday lets, leaving fewer long-term lets for prospective tenants. \nThis is a particular issue for those looking to rent in tourist hotspots, where rates of second home ownership are much higher than average. Research suggests that many second homes have become holiday lets during the pandemic. \nData for second home ownership by local authority in England and Wales (XLSX, 26 KB)\nThose who work in tourist hotspots earn less on average than people who live there. \nFor example, as of April 2020, Cotswold residents earned 28.7% more than people who were employed in the area. There were similar differences between the earnings of residents and workers in other tourist areas such as Derbyshire Dales (27.5%) and Allerdale (24.5%). \nThis is comparable with areas of Outer London such as Bexley (29.0%) and Harrow (27.3%) that are subject to the \u201ccommuter effect\u201d, where people who earn high incomes in the city centre live on the outskirts. \nIn tourist hotspots, workers earn less than residents because of the types of jobs in those areas, with hospitality being the largest employer. \nThe median hospitality salary for a full-time employee was \u00a322,779 per year in April 2020, which was 28% lower than the national average of \u00a331,461. \nHospitality workers were also the most likely to be furloughed during the pandemic. On average, between 23 March 2020 and 31 July 2021, more than half of employees in hospitality were furloughed. \nAs a result, tourist hotspots were among the areas with the highest average furlough rates during the pandemic. \nSouth Lakeland and Eden in the Lake District recorded the highest monthly furlough rates of anywhere in the country, at 40% and 39% respectively in June 2020. \nData for furlough rates in tourist hotspots (XLSX, 27KB)\nWhile house prices have been rising during the pandemic, many people have seen their income fall because of furlough, reduced hours or losing their job. \nThe poorest fifth of workers were more likely than the richest fifth to see a drop in income in the 12 months to March 2021 (42% compared with 31%), according to recent analysis. \nData from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) show that young people (aged under 30) have been more likely to report reduced income than those aged over 60, but less likely to do so than 30- to 59-year-olds. \nHowever, young people remain worse off than other age groups in terms of their overall financial situation. A third (34%) of under 30s responding to the Survey on Living Conditions (SLC) had at least some difficulty making ends meet in the year to March 2021, the highest percentage of any age group. \nThis has implications for the industries that tourism economies rely on, such as hospitality which is reporting record levels of job vacancies. \nNearly a third of hospitality businesses were finding vacancies difficult to fill in late August 2021 (30%), amid reports of workers being priced out of buying or renting near their job. \nWe do not yet know the full impact of coronavirus on housing affordability.

Could the shift to home working see lower emissions in the longer term?\n21 September 2021\nA sharp reduction in personal travel, including commuting to work, drove household greenhouse gas emissions down by 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent in 2020. This drop is equivalent to about 3% of total emissions in 2019. \nCO2 equivalent is a measure of the combined global-warming potential of various greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide as well as carbon dioxide. \nWith many people working remotely, being on furlough, or losing their job in 2020, more people were staying at home using energy for heating. However, these additional emissions were more than offset by the drop in travel emissions. \nWith reduced industrial emissions, households have been the single biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the UK since 2015. Both the energy and manufacturing sectors have reduced emissions significantly over the last decade, while household emissions have remained relatively high. This has increased interest in reducing household emissions to help cut overall emissions to \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050. \nNet zero would mean that total UK emissions would be equal to or less than those removed from the environment, achieved by a combination of reduction and removal of emissions. \nWhile a move to greater long-term homeworking may see transport emissions fall, other activities could push emissions back up and even reverse the effect. \nMost people (85%) who worked from home during the pandemic expect to use a \u201chybrid\u201d approach of both home and office work in the future, according to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. Another 4% expect to work only from home. \nIf you have started travelling in to work less often, you can explore how this might affect your carbon footprint with our interactive tool.\nTotal household emissions - including personal transport, and heating and other activities \u2013 fell from 148 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019 to 133 million tonnes in 2020, as total UK emissions fell from 552 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent to 481 million tonnes. \nThe 10% drop in household emissions is the second greatest annual reduction since the Office for National Statistics (ONS) first aggregated them in 1990. Only 2011 saw a greater reduction when household emissions fell 12%, possibly caused by 2011 being one of the warmest years on record. \nLast year\u2019s drop of 15 million tonnes in household emissions is roughly the same as the CO2 produced by one and a quarter years of coal use at the UK\u2019s pre-pandemic rate of consumption.\nHousehold emissions come primarily from heating the home and personal transport, such as commuting and recreational travel. Between 2019 and 2020, household emissions not relating to travel, which are mostly heating emissions, increased 1.5% from 80 million tonnes CO2, equivalent to 81 million tonnes. \nBut the same period saw household transport emissions (not including industrial transport) drop 24%, from 68 million tonnes CO2 equivalent to 52 million tonnes. This is by far the greatest drop seen in such emissions since the series began in 1990. \nThe 16 million tonne fall in transport emissions means just under one quarter (23%) of the total drop in UK emissions in 2020 was because of changes in personal travel.\nParticulate matter air pollution also fell significantly and it may be the improvement in air quality that many people noticed during the lockdowns. \nPM2.5, which is made up of particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, pose a serious risk to human health. Research suggests that PM2.5 may lead to a loss of six months of life expectancy from birth for UK residents. \nPM2.5 levels were down 7% across the UK, from 114 thousand tonnes in 2019 to 107 thousand tonnes in 2020. There were also drops in other air pollutants, such as PM10 (down 8%), carbon monoxide and benzene (both down 6%).\nRecently released ONS data on household spending seems to reinforce the notion that the drop in transport emissions was driven partly by the increase in home working. \nAs we might expect, households spent less on travel and more on housing, fuel and power. This shift was more pronounced among the highest income households \u2013 the members of which are more likely to work in jobs that can be done from home. \nHouseholds in the lowest 20% income group went from spending a weekly average of \u00a334.90 on transport in 2019 to \u00a327.10 in 2020, a 22% drop. In the same period, the highest-earning 20% went from spending \u00a3141.80 per week on transport to \u00a394.50, a 33% drop. \nFor the lowest income households, spending on housing, fuel and power went down slightly from \u00a370.20 to \u00a369.10 per week, while the highest income households increased spending from a weekly average of \u00a398.40 in 2019 to \u00a3104.00 in 2020. \nThe shift in spending on housing, fuel and power may be because higher income households were more likely to work from home but may also be because higher income households are more likely to live in larger properties that can cost more to heat.\nThe increase in home working represents only one of many dynamics that will determine the overall environmental impact of COVID-19. \nThese data suggest that households and the broader economy have made substantial changes during 2020. Some may have also felt an increased dependence on the natural world, with over 40% of respondents to a Natural England survey saying green spaces had become more important to their wellbeing since the beginning of the pandemic.\nBut many of the changes that have been made - and are still being made - are hard to quantify from an emissions perspective.

At the height of the spring 2020 lockdown, more than one-fifth of usual household spending was largely prevented. \nHouseholds may have been able to cut back on spending if they were able to shift to home working. Higher income households, who tended to spend more on travel pre-pandemic, and whose workers were more likely to be able to work from home, saw a larger drop in spending than low income households. \nHowever, for some, the reduction in spending may have been associated with a fall in income. Around a third of workers saw their household income fall in the financial year ending (FYE) 2021, rising to 42% for the 20% on the lowest incomes (who were more likely to be furloughed and less likely to be able to work from home than people on higher incomes). \nWhile both spending and income fell for many UK households, people are on average finding it easier to make ends meet, with the proportion of people reporting difficulty in making ends meet falling by six percentage points from 34% in the year to March 2020 to 28% in the year ending March 2021. \nThose who had experienced a loss of income were more likely to also report financial pressures, such as difficulty making ends meet. How the pandemic has affected a person or household financially differed by employment status, age and ethnicity. \nRestrictions brought into place to curb the spread of coronavirus, and the changes in behaviours many people adopted due to the pandemic, meant that households did not spend as much in the last year as they would usually. \nThe highest income households saw a larger drop in spending than the lowest. \nNotes\nReduced spending on restaurants and hotels, recreation and culture and transport contributed most to the decline in overall spending for all income groups. \nThe highest income households, whose working members were more likely to work in jobs that could be carried out from home, saw spending on housing, fuel, and power rise during the pandemic, while the poorest households saw spending in this area fall. \nData for contributions to change in weekly household spending by category and income quintile (XLSX, 19KB)\nIncreased spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks had a larger impact on expenditure in the poorest households.

In FYE 2021 this increased to 18% for the lowest income households, and to 12% for those on the highest incomes. \nFalling demand for transport on the other hand contributed more to drops in spending among the richest fifth of households, with spending on international flights and personal vehicles both seeing large falls. \nMuch of reduced spending across all income groups was due to households not travelling abroad. Spending on international holidays (including accommodation, travel and food) accounted for half of reduced spending on average in the highest income households. Among lower income households, travel abroad accounted for a third of reduced spending. \nData for contribution of spending on holidays abroad to falls in total spending by income quintile (XLSX, 19KB)\nWhile many households saw their spending fall dramatically during the pandemic, substantial changes in the economy meant that many also saw their income fall. \nWorkers on lower incomes were more likely to report decreases in income in the year to March 2021 compared to the previous financial year, with 42% of those on the lowest income reporting a decrease, compared with 31% for those on the highest incomes. \nThis could be because of the types of jobs in different income groups. During the first national lockdown in spring 2020, workers on lower incomes were more likely to be furloughed and less likely to be able to work from home than those on higher incomes. \nJobs at greater risk during lockdowns, because they were not likely to be classed as key worker roles or able to be carried out from home, were also lower paid on average than jobs that were less vulnerable during the pandemic. \nPeople on higher incomes were also more likely to be paid in full if they were unable to work, compared with those on lower incomes. \nData for change in household income by income quintile (XLSX, 20KB)\nTaking both the changes to spending and income into account, households typically saw lower levels of spending relative to income during the pandemic. However, higher income households saw a larger spending drop relative to their income than those on lower incomes, providing them with greater opportunity to save or ease financial pressures. \nIn all income groups, the proportion of households whose weekly spending exceeded weekly income fell in the last financial year compared with FYE 2020. However, among the poorest households, two-fifths (40%) still spent more than they had in disposable income (money available after income tax and national insurance contributions).\nOn average, spending among the poorest households was roughly equal to their disposable income in FYE 2021, while the richest households spent less than half the size of their disposable income.\nData for disposable income to spending ratios by income quintile (XLSX, 19KB)\nData from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) suggest that those on higher incomes were able to recover faster from the financial shocks of the first national lockdown. \nBetween April and June 2020, the proportion of people in different income groups using their savings to cover living costs varied, but from Summer 2020, those with an annual income under \u00a320,000 were one-and-a-half times as likely to be using their savings than those on higher incomes. \nThroughout the pandemic, those paid less than \u00a320,000 were also between two and three-and-a-half times more likely to be furloughed than those on higher salaries. \nData for percentage of furloughed workers and percentage that used savings to cover living costs (XLSX, 22KB)\nAs well as household income, characteristics such as employment type, age and ethnicity have affected how the pandemic has impacted individuals\u2019 finances. During the pandemic, people\u2019s ability to make ends meet increased, but this varied across different groups. For some, such as self-employed workers, the ability to make ends meet declined. \nData for percentage of people able to make ends meet (XLSX, 19KB)\nThroughout the pandemic, self-employed workers were consistently more likely to report reduced hours and reduced income than employees. \nAt the end of March 2021, as the third lockdown started to ease, 28% of self-employed workers continued to report reduced hours compared to just 5% of employees. Similarly, over a third (34%) reported reduced income compared to just 10% of employees. \nSelf-employed workers were also more than twice as likely as employees to report borrowing money during the pandemic, although this gap narrowed during the Summer of 2021, as restrictions were lifted. In the week to 1 August 2021, more than 7% of self-employed workers were using savings, compared with less than 3% of employees. \nThis may reflect self-employed workers\u2019 higher likelihood of having significant savings to draw on. On average, more than three-quarters (76%) of self-employed households had enough financial assets to cover a 25% fall in their household employment income, and 61% could cover a 75% fall for three months.\nPrevious analysis covering the period before the pandemic has highlighted significant inequality in income and wealth by ethnic group. \nBetween May 2020 and February 2021, those of Black ethnicity were the most likely to report falling behind with many bills (3%), and to find keeping up with bills a heavy burden (20%) \u2013 a higher proportion than in the whole population. \nData for percentage of people experiencing various financial pressures by ethnic group (XLSX, 19KB)\nData from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) also suggest that ethnic minority populations have not recovered from the economic shocks of the pandemic as quickly as those of White ethnicity. From Summer 2020, the proportion of the White population using savings to cover living costs steadily declined, even through the early 2021 lockdown. \nWhile the proportion of ethnic minorities using savings to cover living costs was similar to the White population during Summer 2020, this figure increased in the third national lockdown, and remained at a similar level (almost 7%) in early Summer 2021, compared with just 3% among the White population. \nEthnic minorities were also consistently more likely to report needing to borrow money or use credit throughout the pandemic.\nYounger people were more likely to report financial pressures than older age groups, with people aged under 35 years most likely to find keeping up with bills a heavy burden (9%). \nLabour market statistics show that younger people were more likely to be furloughed during FYE 2021, and those aged 16 to 24 years were particularly affected, experiencing a greater decline in employment rate compared to those aged 25 years and over. \nHowever, over the last quarter (April to June 2021) there was a stronger increase in the employment rate for young people \u2013 suggesting that the reopening of parts of the economy has allowed young people to either return from furlough or find new work. \nOlder age groups held more savings in the run up to the pandemic. \nThe median balance on individual current accounts, savings and ISAs was more than six times higher for people aged 65 years and over compared to that of those aged 25 to 34 years in the ten months to February 2021, suggesting older age groups were better insulated from some of the financial hits of lockdown.\nThe article draws on findings from the Living Costs and Food Survey, the Survey on Living Conditions, the Wealth and Assets Survey, and the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. These surveys\u2019 time periods, geographies and data collection methods all differ slightly. \nThe Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) is a UK household survey designed to provide information on household expenditure patterns and food consumption. \nThe most recent LCF technical report covers methods and data collection up to financial year ending (FYE) 2020. For a more in-depth explanation of LCF processes and methodology, refer to the \u202fFYE 2016 technical report. \nPlease note that the FYE 2021 data are provisional estimates that have not yet been processed as comprehensively as previous years. Moreover, the current datasets include 69% of the data collected in FYE 2021. Revised financial year end family spending data will be published in Summer 2022 and\u00a0the ONS\u00a0regular income and inequality bulletin will be published in January 2022. \nDuring FYE 2021 respondents did not complete a face-to-face interview with questions on regular items of household expenditure and income details, instead respondents participated in telephone interviews. In addition, respondents were asked to provide copies of receipts (electronic or paper) for the two-week diary period; and interviewers recorded non-receipt based expenditure via additional regular telephone calls during the two-week diary period. \nAn additional housing tenure calibration control has been added to the calculation of weights in this provisional FYE 2021 dataset to adjust for changes in the demographics of the LCF respondents during the pandemic, following the switch from face to face to telephone collection. \nThe provisional FYE 2021 data have not been adjusted for outliers and do not include any partial households. ONS\u2019 typical annual family spending adjusts for unusually high expenditure and income values (outliers). \nData reference tables are published alongside this report, these provide information on response, characteristics of the sample, confidence intervals and statistical significance testing. All spending estimates are rounded to the nearest \u00a30.10. \nThe Survey on Living Conditions (SLC) is a six-year wave survey that provides information on household income. \nThis analysis is based on 23,736 responses from individuals in Great Britain collected between April 2020 and March 2021, which have been linked to the previous wave of data collection (April 2019 and March 2020) where available. \nAs such, the SLC is able to look at how the situation has changed from one year to the next for a cohort of households. \nFurther information about the survey\u2019s sampling and weighting are available in ONS personal and economic wellbeing bulletins sections on measuring the data and strengths and limitations. \nData collection for the eighth round of the Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) is currently in progress and will cover the period April 2020 to March 2022. WAS data used in this release are based on over 12,000 individuals in Great Britain, aged 16 years or over and not in full-time education, who responded in person between May 2020 and February 2021. \nTo provide timely data, these early indicator estimates were produced before data processing or imputation. Estimates of financial assets should be treated with particular caution and may be updated in future releases. No formal significance testing has been undertaken at this stage. \nMore information on the WAS, how the data are collected, strengths, limitations, and appropriate uses is available in the WAS QMI. \nIn response to the coronavirus pandemic, the WAS changed from face-to-face to telephone collection. The full extent of the impact of this change is not yet known. \nOpinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) data used in this article are drawn from the survey\u2019s weekly module that asks about the impact of the pandemic on day-to-day life. For the time periods covered in each module, please see our reference tables. For some analyses we have used pooled data covering several weeks, detailed in our reference tables. \nThe two-category ethnicity breakdown includes: \nThe survey results are weighted to be a nationally representative sample for Great Britain, and data are collected using an online self-completion questionnaire. Individuals who did not want to or were unable to complete the survey online had the opportunity to take part over the phone. \nThe responding sample in the week 28 July 2021 to 1 August 2021 contained 5999 individuals (64% response rate). Survey weights were applied to make estimates representative of the population. \nFurther information on the quality and methodology of all surveys can be found in the measuring the data section of our previous personal and economic wellbeing releases.\nStatistical bulletin| Released on 25 May 2021\nEstimates from multiple sources for personal and economic well-being to understand the economic impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on households in Great Britain from March 2020 to April 2021. \nAll content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated\n", "summary": "Weekly household spending fell by over \u00a3100 during the pandemic\nUK households reduced their spending by an average of \u00a3109.10, or 19%, a week during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (the year to March 2021). \nDuring the year to March 2021, households spent less on goods and services that were restricted at various times to control the spread of coronavirus. \nHouseholds also may have been able to cut back on spending if they were able to shift to home working. Higher income households, who tended to spend more on travel pre-pandemic, and whose workers were more likely to be able to work from home, saw a larger drop in spending than low income households. \nHowever, for some, the reduction in spending may have been associated with a fall in income. Around a third of workers saw their household income fall in the financial year ending (FYE) 2021, rising to 42% for the 20% on the lowest incomes (who were more likely to be furloughed and less likely to be able to work from home than people on higher incomes). \nWhile both spending and income fell for many UK households, people are on average finding it easier to make ends meet, with the proportion of people reporting difficulty in making ends meet falling by six percentage points from 34% in the year to March 2020 to 28% in the year ending March 2021. \n - Read the article on coronavirus and the impact on household finances and living standards \u202f\n", "id": 205}, {"document": "In England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) remained level in the week ending 3 September 2021; we estimate that 754,600 people within the community population in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 704,000 to 808,800), equating to around 1 in 70 people.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the week ending 3 September 2021; we estimate that 46,800 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 35,700 to 59,500), equating to around 1 in 65 people.\nIn Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain in the week ending 3 September 2021; we estimate that 31,800 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 23,000 to 41,800), equating to around 1 in 60 people.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the week ending 3 September 2021; we estimate that 117,300 people in Scotland had COVID-19, (95% credible interval: 98,300 to 137,300) equating to around 1 in 45 people.\n", "summary": "Infections increase in Scotland and Wales\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) infections remained level in England in the week ending 3 September 2021.\nIn Scotland in the week ending 3 September, estimated infections increased and were the highest we have recorded.

A changeover in the systems used to collect these data has introduced a level shift in the time series from 14 June 2021 onwards and users should not make comparisons between data before and after this date. However, we feel that re-introducing the publication of these data will assist users in understanding the latest shipping movements. The data produced prior to the change, for 1 April 2019 to 13 June 2021, can still be compared within that period.\nA full methodological review of our current method of data collection is underway and data may be subject to revision once this is complete. The accompanying dataset has been updated back to 14 June 2021 and will continue to be updated using the current method until the review is complete.\nFigure 1: There was an average of 307 daily ship visits in the week to 15 August 2021, an increase from 291 in the previous week\tDaily movements in shipping visits, UK, seasonally adjusted, 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2021\tSource: exactEarthNotes:The vertical line indicates the date when the data collection system changed.

They track the daily CHAPS payments made by credit and debit card payment processors to around 100 major UK retail corporates. These payments are the proceeds of recent credit and debit card transactions made by customers at their stores, both via physical and via online platforms.\u00a0More information on the indicator is provided in the accompanying\u00a0methodology article.\u00a0\u00a0\nCompanies are allocated to one of four categories based on their primary business: \u00a0\u00a0\n\"staples\" refers to companies that sell essential goods that households need to purchase, such as food and utilities\u00a0\u00a0\n\"work-related\" refers to companies providing public transport or selling petrol\u00a0\u00a0\n\"delayable\" refers to companies selling goods whose purchase could be delayed, such as clothing or furnishings\u00a0\u00a0\n\"social\" refers to spending on travel and eating out\nUsers should note the daily payment data is the sum of card transactions processed up to the previous working day, so there is a slight time lag when compared with real-life events on the chart.\nThe vertical lines indicate key events. In order, the events are: first national lockdown begins; some non-essential shops allowed to reopen; regional restrictions begin in England; Christmas period; lockdowns announced in England and Scotland; reopening of non-essential shops, and outdoor pubs and restaurants in England; further easing of lockdown restrictions, including re-opening of indoor pubs and restaurants in England; most legal restrictions to control COVID-19 lifted in England. \nPercentage point difference is derived from current week and previous week index before rounding.\nFigure 3 shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors, \"merchant acquirers\".\u00a0\nIn the week to 12 August 2021, the CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases in aggregate decreased by 5 percentage points from the previous week to 94% of its February 2020 average level. This was driven by decreases in all spending categories; \"social\" and \"staple\" both fell by 7 percentage points, \"work-related\" fell by 4 percentage points and \"delayable\" fell by 3 percentage points.\nIn the latest week, \"work-related\" and \"staple\" spending remained above their February 2020 average levels, at 112% and 101%, respectively. Conversely, \"social\" and \"delayable\" spending were at 88% and 89% of their February 2020 average levels.\nInitial results from Wave 37 of the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) cover the reference period 26 July to 8 August 2021, with a response rate of 19.9% (7,645 responses). The survey was live for the period 9 to 17 August 2021.\nPlease note, as part of our regular and ongoing quality assessment of our methods, we will be introducing improved methods used to weight smaller businesses within the BICS sample where we use employment and turnover to do so. We plan to introduce these new methods in the publication of 26 August 2021. This may lead to some revisions in estimates.\nInitial weighted results, Wave 37 of Office for National Statistics' (ONS') Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS).\nA detailed description of the weighting methodology and the weights used for each variable is available in Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS).\nData are plotted in the middle of the two-week period of each wave.\nNotes\nThese figures are experimental estimates of online job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, by category, by UK country and English region. The number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour. The Adzuna categories used do not correspond to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) Vacancy Survey.\nFurther category breakdowns are included in the\u00a0online job advert estimates dataset\u00a0and more details on the methodology can be found in\u00a0Using Adzuna data to derive an indicator of weekly vacancies.\nUsers should note that week-on-week changes in online job advert volumes are outlined as percentages, rather than as percentage point changes. Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the charts and accompanying dataset.\n.XLSX\nAccording to Adzuna, on 13 August 2021, the total volume of online job adverts in the UK was broadly similar to the previous week (6 August 2021).\nOf the 28 categories, 14 saw a weekly decrease in the number of online job adverts, 7 were unchanged, while the remaining 7 increased when compared with the previous week. The largest weekly decreases were in \"charity/voluntary\" and \"education\" which both fell by 7%. The total volume of online job adverts has fallen by 12% in the \"education\" category since the week ending 23 July 2021. The largest weekly increase was in \"domestic help\" which rose by 4%.\nThe total volume of online job adverts remained substantially above pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic volume, at 128% of its February 2020 average level. The \"transport/logistics/warehouse\" category remains the category with the highest level of job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic level, at 335% of its February 2020 average level.\nThere are only six categories that are below pre-pandemic levels. The lowest of these are \"legal\" and \"energy/oil and gas\" which are 73% and 82% of their February 2020 average level, respectively.\n.XLSX\nOn 13 August 2021, the volume of online job adverts had decreased or remained the same across nearly all UK countries and English regions when compared with the previous week (6 August 2021). The exceptions being in Northern Ireland and North East England where they rose by 4% and 2% respectively. \u00a0\nIn the latest week, volumes of online job adverts remained above their February 2020 average levels in all UK countries and English regions. The highest of these were in North East England, Northern Ireland and East Midlands at 181%, 161% and 160% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively. The North East has been the region with the highest number of online job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic levels since 9 April 2021.\nMeanwhile, relative to February 2020 average levels, the volume of online job adverts on 13 August 2021 remained lowest in London, where the corresponding figure was 104%, unchanged from last week.\nThese data are daily flight figures from the\u00a0European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation\u00a0(EUROCONTROL). Daily flight numbers for the UK alongside other countries are available in EUROCONTROL's dashboard. EUROCONTROL is a pan-European, civil-military organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation. Its Aviation Intelligence and Performance Review Unit provides independent collection and validation of air navigation services performance-related data and intelligence gathering.\nThese flights data include international arrivals and departures to and from the UK (including Crown Dependencies) and domestic UK flights, but exclude overflights (flights that pass over UK territory). They capture all flight movements that operate under Instrumental Flight Rules (IFR), where the pilot uses instruments in the flight deck to control, guide and adjust the plane. This includes commercial flights carrying passengers and cargo as well as non-commercial flights such as private and military flights.\nData from EUROCONTROL do not include information on the volume of passengers or cargo carried on UK flights. Especially in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, flights might not be operating at full capacity and therefore trends in passengers and cargo will differ from trends in flights presented here.\nFigure 7: In the week ending 15 August 2021, the seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,142, broadly similar to the previous week (3,111)\tNumber of daily flights, non-seasonally adjusted, and seven-day moving average, 2 January 2019 to 15 August 2021, UK\tSource: European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL)\tNotes:The fall in February 2020 coincides with Storm Ciara.The falls in December and January coincide with Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day.Download this chart Figure 7: In the week ending 15 August 2021, the seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,142, broadly similar to the previous week (3,111)\tImage.csv.xls\nThe fall in February 2020 coincides with Storm Ciara.\nThe falls in December and January coincide with Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day.\nIn the week ending 15 August 2021, the seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,142, broadly similar to the previous week (3,111). It is, however, the highest weekly average number of UK flights seen since the week ending 22 March 2020 (the day before the first national lockdown was implemented in the UK).\nThe seven-day average number of UK daily flights has now increased by 120% from the week ending 23 May 2021, the week that international travel was allowed to restart and the UK government implemented the travel traffic light system (17 May 2021).\nThe average number of UK daily flights in the latest week was at 48% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019, broadly unchanged from the previous week. In the latest week, compared with the equivalent week of 2020 (when UK travel corridors were still in place), the seven-day average number of daily flights was at 115% of its 2020 level.\nThe full data time series available for UK flights can be found in the\u00a0accompanying dataset, which contains daily flight numbers and the rolling seven-day averages.\nNational footfall figures are supplied by\u00a0Springboard, a provider of data on customer activity. They measure the following for overall UK retail footfall, as well as by high street, retail park, and shopping centre categories:\nFigure 8: UK retail footfall levels were at 82% of the equivalent week of 2019 in the week to 14 August 2021; the highest comparable level since the week to 12 June 2021\tVolume of overall daily retail footfall, percentage compared with the equivalent day of the equivalent week of 2019, 1 March 2020 to 14 August 2021\tSource: Springboard and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\tNotes:The vertical lines indicate notable events.

Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the chart.\nAccording to Springboard, in the week to 14 August 2021, the volume of overall retail footfall in the UK increased slightly by 2% from the previous week (week to 7 August 2021). This continues the gradual upward trend since the lifting of most legal restrictions in England on 19 July 2021 and is the sixth consecutive weekly rise in overall retail.\nThe latest week's increase was driven by a week-on-week rise of 3% in footfall on high streets. In comparison, footfall at both shopping centres and retail parks was broadly unchanged compared with the previous week.\nIn the latest week to 14 August 2021, overall retail footfall was at 82% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. Comparing retail locations, footfall at retail parks remained the strongest relative to pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels, at 98% of its equivalent 2019 level. Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for high streets and shopping centres were 78% and 76%, respectively. Throughout most of the pandemic, footfall at retail parks has consistently been strongest when compared with other retail locations, relative to their 2019 levels.\nFigure 9: The South West continued to be the region with the highest retail footfall relative to pre-pandemic levels in the week to 14 August 2021, 88% of the level in the same week of 2019\tVolume of daily retail footfall, percentage of the level recorded on the same day of the equivalent week of 2019, UK countries and English regions, 1 March 2020 to 14 August 2021\tSource: Springboard and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\tDownload this image Figure 9: The South West continued to be the region with the highest retail footfall relative to pre-pandemic levels in the week to 14 August 2021, 88% of the level in the same week of 2019\t.png (78.6 kB)\nAccording to Springboard, in the week to 14 August 2021, retail footfall saw week-on-week percentage increases in 4 of the 10 UK countries and English regions, the largest of which were in Northern Ireland and Wales, which saw rises of 4% and 3% respectively over the week. The remaining 6 of the 10 countries and English regions remained broadly unchanged from the previous week.\nIn the same week, relative to the levels seen in the equivalent week of 2019, retail footfall continued to be strongest in the South West of England at 88%, followed by the North and Yorkshire, and Wales both at 87%. In contrast, retail footfall was weakest in Scotland at 77% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019, followed by Greater London and Northern Ireland, both of which were at 80%.\nOpenTable is a provider of data for online restaurant reservations, with daily data for the UK, London and Manchester being publicly available in its The state of the industry dashboard.

This continues the broadly upward trend in recent weeks following the lifting of most legal restrictions in England on 19 July 2021, after which the seven-day average estimate of UK seated diners has increased by 17 percentage points.\nIn the latest week, the seven-day average estimate of seated diners in Manchester substantially increased by 11 percentage points to 143% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. During the same period, the equivalent figure for London was 81%, an increase of 5 percentage points from the previous week. Both of these areas have seen notable increases since the 19 July 2021, after the easing of most lockdown restrictions in England. Over this period, Manchester has seen a substantial increase of 41 percentage points, whereas London has seen an increase of 12 percentage points.\nThe UK seven-day average estimate of seated diners has remained above the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019 since the week ending 17 May 2021 (following the reopening of indoor hospitality in England on 17 May 2021). Since the week ending 26 April 2021 to the latest week, seated diner estimates in Manchester have consistently remained above the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. Over the same period in London, however, this has only occurred on one occasion, which was during the week to 31 May 2021, a week that included the second May bank holiday.\nThis section includes some provisional results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) covering the period 11 to 15 August 2021. The survey went out to 4,989 adults in Great Britain and had a response rate of 63% (3,130 responses). Further information to help understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain will be available in\u00a0Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain, due to be published on 20 August 2021.\nIn the period 11 to 15 August 2021, the proportion of working adults in Great Britain who in the past seven days:\ntravelled to work (either exclusively or in combination with working from home) was broadly similar to the previous week at 60%\nworked exclusively from home was broadly similar to the previous week at 18%\nneither travelled to work nor worked from home was unchanged from the previous week at 22%\nOf the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for food and medicine increased slightly by 2 percentage points from the previous week to 84%.\nThe proportion of these adults who shopped for things other than food and medicine in the last seven days increased by 3 percentage points from the previous week to 47%.\nOf the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so and wore a face covering was broadly similar to the previous week at 89%.

Some people in poor health may have been hesitant initially because of pre-existing medical conditions or concerns about side-effects. \nThe widespread fall in hesitancy, regardless of self-reported health, coincides with growing evidence that vaccines are effective in preventing hospitalisation from COVID-19, as well as changes to guidance for those who are double-vaccinated. Fully vaccinated adults are now able to return from amber list countries without quarantining, and by 16 August they will no longer need to self-isolate when identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19. \nOur analysis hasn\u2019t tested whether falls in hesitancy are driven by bad health or a combination of factors. \nData on coronavirus vaccine hesitancy by self-reported health (XLSX, 22KB)\nAt a sub-regional level, most areas have seen a fall in vaccine hesitancy so far in 2021. \nAreas that recorded the highest hesitancy rates during January to March had seen a reduction by April to July, such as Inner London East (13% to 7%), Outer London West and North West (12% to 7%), and West Wales and The Valleys (11% to 5%). \nHowever, there remains some local variation, with hesitancy rates remaining as high as 10% in Outer London East and North East, compared with 2% in parts of Scotland, Cheshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. \nAreas in the map are International Territorial Level (ITL) 2, more information about geographic classification is available in the data tables. \nData on coronavirus vaccine hesitancy in ITL2 areas (XLSX, 23KB)\nIn line with trends observed across Great Britain as a whole, young adults, those of Black or Black British ethnicity, and the unemployed are generally the most hesitant towards vaccines in all English regions, Scotland and Wales. \nRates of hesitancy among these groups tended to be highest in London and the Midlands in April to July 2021, despite falling compared with earlier in the year. \nNearly one in six (15%) young adults (16 to 29-year-olds) in the West Midlands reported vaccine hesitancy in the latest period. \nThe West Midlands also had a relatively high proportion of the unemployed saying they were hesitant towards coronavirus vaccines (19%), as did London (17%). \nIn the East Midlands, one in three (34%) Black or Black British adults reported vaccine hesitancy. \nAmong English regions, London and the West Midlands recorded high rates of hesitancy among adults living in deprived areas (both 12%). \nData on coronavirus vaccine hesitancy by selected personal characteristics (XLSX, 20KB)\nVaccine hesitancy rates were relatively high in London among certain groups of adults. \nThis includes one in nine (11%) people with no qualifications in London reporting vaccine hesitancy in April to July, among the highest in Great Britain and little changed since January to March 2021 (10%). \nLondon is also among the most hesitant for renters (10%), and those who are unable to afford an unexpected, but necessary, expense of \u00a3850 (13%). \nMeanwhile, 1 in 10 (10%) adults living in London households of three or more people remain hesitant. However, only 4% of those who care for someone in their own home in London reported hesitancy in April to July 2021. \nAs of 19 July, all adults aged 18 years and over in the UK had been offered at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nThe latest UK-wide data (up to 1 August 2021) show that 88.6% of the adult population has received one dose of a vaccine, with 72.7% double-vaccinated. Numbers for the four UK nations are available on the GOV.UK coronavirus dashboard. \nEstimates of vaccine uptake among those aged 50 years and over are available for English regions in Public Health England\u2019s COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring for England (CHIME) tool. \nThe most recent data, up to the end of June 2021, show that one in nine (11%) adults aged 50 years and over in London have not received a coronavirus vaccine, twice the rate of any other English region. \nThe figures cover residents in England who could be linked to the 2011 Census and General Practice (GP) data. They should not be used to represent the total number of vaccinations, and may also differ from the administrative data on vaccinations published by NHS England weekly. \nData on adults aged 50 years and over that have not received a coronavirus vaccine (XLSX, 18KB)\nAmong ethnic groups, the highest rate of not receiving a vaccine was in London for Black Caribbean adults (32%) and West Midlands for those of Black African ethnicity (30%). \nThose who have never worked and are long-term unemployed were more likely to have not had a vaccine than those in employment. The highest rate of non-vaccination was in London (21%). \nJust as rates of vaccine hesitancy increase with levels of deprivation, the likelihood of not having a vaccine also rises in more deprived areas across all English regions.

See Section 10. \nOlder UK residents interviewed arriving into the UK were more likely to have been vaccinated than younger UK residents. Our findings (Figure 1) align with the progress of the vaccine rollout in the UK. UK residents in the older age groups were more likely to have received their vaccine earlier in the period, February to June 2021, than those in the younger age groups. In May and June 2021, as the vaccine rollout was extended and offered to younger age groups, the proportion of UK residents vaccinated in the younger age groups increased, although the proportions remained lower in these age groups compared with older travellers. In June 2021, 62% of UK residents and 62% of overseas residents arriving into the UK had had at least one dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. Of those surveyed, the trend in the vaccination status of overseas residents was similar to the trend for UK residents.\nThe majority of UK residents (66%) and overseas residents (69%) interviewed arriving into the UK in June, felt safe because of social distancing during their journey. While there was a rise in the proportion of UK residents who said they felt safe between March and April 2021, proportions remained largely consistent across the period for overseas residents (Figure 2).\nMost UK and overseas residents interviewed said that the wearing of face coverings made them feel safe during their journey into the UK. This is a trend that remained stable during the period between February and June 2021. Slightly more overseas residents than UK residents (6 percentage points) said that the wearing of face coverings made them feel safe (75% and 69% in June 2021 respectively) (Figure 3).\nThe majority of travellers interviewed (72% of UK residents and 71% of overseas residents in June 2021), said that availability of hand sanitiser during their journey made them feel safe. This trend has remained consistent amongst UK residents over the period, while there has been a slight decline, since February, in the proportion of overseas residents who said that the availability of hand sanitiser made them feel safe. \nIn June 2021, 52% of UK residents and 64% of overseas residents arriving into the UK thought a coronavirus (COVID-19) test was very important for safety (Figure 4). Amongst both groups there has been a decline in this opinion since February 2021, particularly between May and June 2021. However, the increase in the proportion who said that testing was \u201cquite important\u201d, means that overall COVID-19 testing remains \u201cimportant\u201d for the majority of travellers.\nIn June 2021, the proportions of both UK residents and overseas residents who thought COVID-19 testing was very important for safety was less than the proportions of those who said that they felt safe on their journey because of social distancing, the wearing of face coverings, and the availability of hand sanitiser. This is the first month this has occurred.\nThe majority of UK residents interviewed, found it either difficult (47%) or very difficult (33%) to follow overseas coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions (June 2021); this has remained consistent since February 2021 (Figure 5).\nConversely, the majority of overseas residents interviewed arriving into the UK said they understood UK COVID-19 restrictions either quite well or very well, a trend that has remained consistent since February 2021 (Figure 6). In June 2021 26% of overseas residents said that they understood UK restrictions quite well, and 69% understood them very well. Very few said they did not understand restrictions very well (2%) or did not understand them at all (0%).\nAlthough overseas residents interviewed were more likely to say they understood UK COVID-19 restrictions very well, in June 2021 70% of overseas residents said that they were not at all confident accessing information about the UK\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions. This proportion has remained consistently above 65% since February 2021 (Figure 7). In June 2021, 70% said they were not at all confident accessing this information with an additional 26% being not very confident. Only 2% felt somewhat confident or very confident accessing information about the UK\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions. \nInternational Passenger Survey findings on COVID-19 Dataset | Released 9 August 2021 Monthly figures about attitudes of United Kingdom (UK) and overseas residents arriving into the UK, towards social distancing, mask wearing, hand sanitiser availability and COVID-19 restrictions and the proportion of travellers who have received at least one vaccine dose, using unweighted results from the International Passenger Survey for the period covering February to June 2021 (experimental statistics). \nInternational Passenger Survey findings on COVID-19 Dataset | Released 9 August 2021 Monthly figures about attitudes of United Kingdom (UK) and overseas residents arriving into the UK, towards social distancing, mask wearing, hand sanitiser availability and COVID-19 restrictions and the proportion of travellers who have received at least one vaccine dose, using unweighted results from the International Passenger Survey for the period covering February to June 2021 (experimental statistics). \n\nA person who, being permanently resident in a country outside the UK, visits the UK for a period of less than 12 months. UK citizens resident overseas for 12 months or more coming home on leave are included in this category. Visits abroad are visits for a period of less than 12 months by people permanently resident in the UK (who may be of foreign nationality).\nA new traffic light system has been in place since 17 May 2021, banding countries into \"green\", \"amber\" and \"red\" lists. It is important to note that the categorisation of countries has changed throughout the period between February and June 2021 reported in this data, and this should be considered when analysing the results of the data on understanding and accessing information on restrictions.\nThe rollout of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine across the UK, phase one of which began in December 2020, with the full vaccine delivery plan available.\nThis bulletin uses data from the International Passenger Survey (IPS). IPS data is regularly released in the Travel and Tourism series. The data presented in this bulletin are based on new questions which have been added to the IPS to collect data measuring the attitudes towards and experiences of coronavirus (COVID-19) and associated restrictions, among travellers arriving into the UK. Detailed information on the IPS methodology is available.\u00a0\nAll COVID-19 questions were asked of all respondents arriving into the UK with the following exceptions:\nThe following two questions are only asked to overseas residents:\n\"How well do you understand the Coronavirus (COVID-19) regulations that will apply to you during your visit to the UK?\"\n\"How confident are you that you know how to access official information on Coronavirus (COVID-19) regulations for the UK?\"\nThe following question is only asked to UK residents:\nTotals shown, and those used to calculate percentages, include all overseas arrivals (international visitors to the UK and UK residents arriving back into the UK). Questions were not asked of travellers leaving the UK. Residents of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man have been counted as overseas residents (as have all Crown dependencies). Sea and tunnel data are excluded as the numbers are too small; because of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions it wasn't possible to interview on board Dover ferries or the Eurotunnel. Overall, sea and tunnel numbers are much lower than pre-COVID and show a 75% drop in passengers.\u00a0\nThe sample used for both UK and overseas residents across the study (February to\u00a0June 2021) totals 17,720. Individual breakdowns by residency and month cannot be supplied because of disclosure control of low counts. Age groupings were based on self-reported data which is not verified.\nAround 90% of international traffic into and out of the UK is subject to IPS sampling. COVID-19 questions were not asked if a person under 16 years was sampled unless permission from their parent or guardian was obtained. Due to social distancing guidelines, interviewers must maintain a two meter distance from respondents, which presents challenges in terms of obtaining response. It is much more difficult to present the tablet to the respondent to select a response at this distance.\nIt is very difficult to predict the numbers of interviews that can be expected to be achieved in the current operating circumstances, where interviews are being conducted under social distancing and passenger flow is likely to be very low. We have attempted to offset the effects of the low numbers of anticipated travellers by reducing sampling intervals (so a higher proportion are selected for interview).\u00a0\nIn order to provide the timeliest insights, this bulletin contains unweighted data based on the actual numbers of people interviewed, meaning no account is taken of the different numbers of travellers represented by each respondent to the survey. Trends observed in unweighted data over time may be because of changes in the composition of survey respondents, rather than trends for the whole travelling population. Analysis comparing the weighted and unweighted data for February and March 2021 found little difference in trends, suggesting this unweighted data can be considered as broadly indicative.\nThis also means no confidence intervals are provided and therefore caution must be taken when comparing figures and conclusions drawn from this sample time series, comparison should not be extended to all travellers travelling during this period. Totals should also not be compared with\u00a0the weighted totals in the Travel and Tourism bulletins.\nThe following quality caveats associated with using unweighted data should be considered.\nThe IPS sample is drawn to be representative by quarter and therefore may not be evenly distributed across each month in terms of which traffic is sampled. For example, this could mean that by chance in one month more boats were sampled than other months simply because of shift allocation. A further example could be that one month simply happened to have more weekend shifts than weekday shifts.\u00a0\nPotential differences in mode of transport and the sample sizes between those modes from month to month could cause what look like changes in the data each month. However, it could just be that the composition of the sample has changed from month to month.\nSome routes are overrepresented in the data because of the sample design, for example air travel to Heathrow. Potential policy changes that only affect one route or mode of transport could have an unrepresentative effect on the sample shown.\u00a0\nDue to the unweighted data providing smaller samples for each month, comparisons in this bulletin looking for reasons for differences between the months are based on observations in the data and not on statistically significant differences. These are experimental statistics which are being published to involve users and stakeholders at an early stage in assessing their suitability and quality.\nThis release will continue to be updated on a monthly basis; therefore, in September we will publish data up to July 2021.

Our interactive chart and map let you see what happened where you live. \n3 August 2021\nSo far in England and Wales, there have been two periods during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic when weekly and monthly registrations of deaths from all causes were consistently higher than the five-year average \u2013 also known as \u201cexcess deaths\u201d. \nUsing weekly data, the first period was from the week ending 20 March to the week ending 12 June 2020 and the second was from the week ending 11 September 2020 to the week ending 5 March 2021. Using monthly data, the periods above average were from March to July 2020 and then from September 2020 to March 2021. \nExcess deaths are the clearest way to compare the likely impact of the pandemic over time, because a substantial number of non-COVID-19 excess deaths were recorded early in the pandemic, in March and April 2020. One reason for excess deaths could be that COVID-19 was undiagnosed. \nNumber of deaths registered by week, 28 December 2019 to 02 July 2021 (XLSX, 13KB)\nFor the first time, we are also presenting analysis of monthly excess deaths at a middle layer super output area (MSOA) or neighbourhood level. \nSome areas experienced considerably more excess deaths, which are deaths from any cause above the average for the same time of year between 2015 and 2019, at different points in the pandemic than others. \nDeaths registered at an MSOA level were published monthly until April 2021. \nThere are 7,201 neighbourhoods (officially known as middle layer super output areas or MSOAs) in England and Wales with an average population of around 8,000. \nThis interactive chart will display the number of excess deaths in individual neighbourhoods in England and Wales. \nDeaths registered by MSOA, March 2020 to April 2021, compared with the average for 2015 to 2019 (XLSX, 3.8MB)\nOverall, the North West, London and North East had the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in 2020. \nAt an individual neighbourhood level between March and July 2020, some of the hardest hit places for overall excess deaths were spread across the north of England, Midlands and south of England. \nThere were around 200 neighbourhoods where the number of deaths was at least double what would normally have been expected during those five months. \nThese included Crabtree and Fir Vale in Sheffield, which had the largest excess, with 123 deaths between March and July 2020, 77 more than the average of 46, an excess of 167%. \nWhen infections and deaths due to COVID-19 increased again in the autumn of 2020, total deaths registered in England and Wales remained above average for seven months. \nBetween September 2020 and March 2021, the West St Leonards area of Hastings recorded 184 deaths, which was 65 (55%) more than average.

To make a fair comparison between these larger areas, this section uses age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs). \nAge-standardised mortality rate per month by local authority district, March 2020 to April 2021 (XLSX, 271KB)\nThe first peak in coronavirus deaths was in April 2020, while the country was in the middle of the first national lockdown. At this time, urban centres in London, Birmingham, the north of England and South Wales had the highest rates of deaths due to any cause. \nThere were many reasons why certain communities experienced high death rates, with more deaths due to COVID-19 in the most deprived areas of England and Wales than in the least deprived areas. \nThere were also higher death rates among some ethnic minority groups as well as in males and those with pre-existing conditions. There have also been higher death rates among people with jobs with regular exposure to COVID-19. \nAlthough overall deaths in England and Wales reduced during the summer of 2020, in some areas of northern England, such as Tameside and Blackburn with Darwen, mortality rates were higher than normal. \nThe autumn and winter of 2020 saw mortality rates peak in different local areas in different months. In November 2020, mortality rates were highest in Rochdale and Blaenau Gwent and in December 2020 parts of Lincolnshire such as Lincoln and Boston recorded their highest mortality rates of the pandemic. \nAs 2021 began with a third national lockdown, there were many areas in both England and Wales with high mortality rates; with the area from Essex to East London to East Sussex suffering due to the spread of the Alpha COVID-19 variant, first identified in Kent. \nIn January 2021, the mortality rate in England was highest in Barking and Dagenham. In Wales, the highest was in Bridgend. \nOn average, overall mortality rates in England and Wales declined in February 2021, although in some areas they were only reaching their peak. These areas included Copeland, Great Yarmouth, Bolsover and Norwich. In March 2021, Blackpool had the highest ASMR in England and Wales, but this was below its April 2020 peak. \nSince March 2021, deaths in England and Wales returned to average or near to average for the time of year, although deaths due to COVID-19 increased again in July. \nThese are used for comparisons over time and between areas rather than numbers of deaths, as ASMRs account for differences in the population size and age structure. \nExcess deaths in this analysis are the difference between the number of deaths registered in each period (week or month) and the same period in the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Using the average gives us a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a \"normal\" year, before the COVID-19 pandemic. \nStatistical bulletin| Released on 21 April 2022\nProvisional counts of the number of deaths registered in England and Wales, including deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19), in the latest weeks for which data are available.\nArticle| Released on 25 February 2021\nUse our interactive map to explore the number of COVID-19 deaths in your area\nAll content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated\n", "summary": "How excess deaths have changed each month where you live\nUse your postcode to see the number of excess deaths each month in your neighbourhood. \nThere are 7,201 neighbourhoods (officially known as Middle-layer Super Output Areas or MSOAs) of England and Wales with an average population of around 8,000.

This means at least 80% of visits to friends and relatives would now require quarantine and COVID-19 tests on return to the UK. The UK government is telling people they should not travel to countries on the red or amber lists. \nThe true figure will be higher because the red, amber and green lists include countries where data on visits are grouped due to small numbers.

People who visit countries on green lists do not have to quarantine on returning to the UK. However, other countries also have their own restrictions on whether or not they would allow UK residents to visit, including with or without quarantine. \nThe Republic of Ireland is the only country in the top 20 for visiting friends and relatives where quarantine is not required on returning to the UK.

Many deaths not due to COVID-19, which would normally have occurred in hospital, happened in private homes instead. \n7 May 2021\nDeaths in private homes, from all causes, were one-third higher in 2020 than in the previous five years. There were around 167,000 deaths from all causes in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with an average of 125,000 between 2015 and 2019. \nThe majority of deaths due to COVID-19 (where the coronavirus was the main cause) occurred in hospitals and care homes, while many deaths from other causes, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, happened in private homes. Our analysis shows that many of these deaths at home were people who, in a non-pandemic year, may have typically died elsewhere such as in hospital. \nDeaths in hospital were 4% above the five-year average. However, if deaths due to COVID-19 are excluded, then deaths in hospitals would have been 16% lower than the average. \nOur first release of the finalised mortality data for 2020 shows that \u201cexcess deaths\u201d from all causes were 14% above the five-year average in England and Wales, with the coronavirus (COVID-19) being the main reason for excess deaths. \nExcess deaths are the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Using the average gives us a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a \"usual\" year, before the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThere were almost 76,000 more deaths from all causes and in all locations (hospitals, care homes, private homes and elsewhere) in England and Wales in 2020 than the five-year average. COVID-19 was responsible for 97% of the excess, having not previously existed. \nThis analysis looks at England and Wales as a whole; trends for the two countries may differ and are shown separately in the charts and data tables. \nData download\nMore than half (around 41,000) of the 76,000 excess deaths, from all causes, in England and Wales in 2020 occurred in private homes. A further 25,000 occurred in care homes. \nThe contribution of COVID-19 to this increase in deaths in private homes is small, at just over 3,000. The increase of non-COVID-19 deaths in private homes is 30% above the five-year average. \nCare homes recorded a 21% rise in deaths from all causes, with nearly 25,000 more than expected \u2014 almost 19,000 of them due to COVID-19. Excluding the coronavirus, other care home deaths were 5% up on the five-year average. \nIn hospitals, which were under significant pressure because of numbers of patients with the coronavirus, there were around 258,000 deaths from all causes, 10,000 (4%) more than the five-year average. \nDeaths in hospital from causes other than COVID-19 fell by more than 40,000 (16%). \nThe new coronavirus (COVID-19) was the underlying cause of almost 74,000 deaths in 2020. Despite the first death only being registered in the week ending 13 March, it became the overall leading cause of death in England and Wales in 2020. \nThe total number of deaths not due to COVID-19 in 2020 (534,000) was only slightly higher than the average for 2015 to 2019 (532,000) in England and Wales. Looking at Wales specifically, deaths not due to COVID-19 in 2020 (33,000) were slightly below the average (33,400). \nThe next highest number of deaths registered in 2020 were \"dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease\", \"ischaemic heart diseases\", \"cerebrovascular diseases\" (stroke) and certain types of cancer, which is similar to recent years. \nDeaths from different types of cancer (\"malignant neoplasms\") are recorded separately. This is because cancer is a term that describes a collection of related diseases that vary widely in their behaviour and response to treatment. \nData download\nThe most significant rise in deaths based on the previous five years was from \"chronic rheumatic heart diseases\", with just under 1,100 deaths registered in 2020, 36% higher when compared with 789 a year on average between 2015 and 2019. \n\"Cirrhosis and other diseases of the liver\" caused almost 9,700 deaths, compared with an average of 8,300 between 2015 and 2019. Though deaths from this cause had generally been increasing over time prior to the pandemic, the rise between 2019 and 2020 was larger than seen in recent years. Proportionally, the biggest shift in deaths by this cause was in deaths in private homes, with nearly 2,400 in 2020 compared with an expected 1,800 (a rise of 31%). Analysis from Public Health England and academic studies has suggested that alcohol consumption in higher-risk drinkers increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact on mortality. \nIncreases in deaths from these causes were the highest above the expected range, using z-scores. \nThe z-scores are a more meaningful measure than percentage changes, which can be skewed by small numbers. \nThere were 8,000 fewer deaths in England and Wales than expected from \"influenza and pneumonia\", likely due in part to social distancing reducing the spread. \n\"Bronchitis, emphysema and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\" and \"renal failure\" were the underlying causes of death that fell the farthest below what was expected based on their five-year averages. \nData download\nBreast cancer deaths (\"malignant neoplasms of breast\") were broadly in line with the 2015 to 2019 average. There were 10,385 deaths compared with an average of just over 10,200. \nHowever, more breast cancer deaths were registered in private homes than in hospitals, compared with the five-year average. \nThere were just over 3,900 breast cancer deaths in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with just over 2,800 in hospitals. This compares with an average of just under 2,900 deaths at home and 3,400 deaths in hospital per year between 2015 and 2019. \nFor prostate cancer (\"malignant neoplasm of prostate\"), 4,700 deaths out of a total of nearly 11,000 were in private homes in 2020 and just under 2,900 were in hospitals, compared with 3,300 in private homes and 3,600 in hospitals on average between 2015 and 2019. \n\"Parkinson\u2019s disease\" and \"diabetes\" deaths in private homes were up, by 66% for \"Parkinson\u2019s disease\" (616 excess deaths) and by 60% for \"diabetes\" (894 excess deaths). \nDeaths due to \"influenza and pneumonia\" in private homes were 8% below the five-year average. \nData download\nThere were more deaths (from all causes) in private homes in each month of 2020 than in a normal year, after the coronavirus pandemic struck in March. \nWhile the peak in excess deaths in care homes during April 2020 was much higher than in private homes, deaths remained above average in private homes for the rest of the year. Deaths other than in private homes in England fell below the five-year average during July and August 2020 while in Wales this happened in August and September 2020. \nData download\nIn 2020, 89,000 people aged 85 years and over died in hospitals in England and Wales while 94,000 died in care homes and 50,000 in private homes. \nThe number of people aged 85 years and over dying in hospital was slightly below the five-year average during 2020. However, among this age group, almost 31,000 more people than expected died in private homes and care homes. \nDeaths, from all causes, recorded in private homes among people aged 85 years and over were 43% above the five-year average in England and 38% above average in Wales during 2020. In care homes, the number of excess deaths came to 20% in England and 22% in Wales. \nAt the same time, deaths in hospital from all causes among those aged 85 years and over fell slightly, while deaths in age groups 45 to 64 years and 75 to 84 years increased in both England and Wales. Hospital deaths among the age group 65 to 74 years increased in England but not in Wales. \nData download\nThere were 258,000 deaths from all causes in hospitals in England and Wales in 2020, 10,000 (4%) up on the five-year average. Deaths due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) accounted for 1 in 5 of these. \nWhile there were almost 33,000 deaths due to COVID-19 of females in England and Wales in 2020, fewer females died (of any cause) in hospital than the five-year average. \nThere were 118,000 female deaths in hospital from any cause in England and Wales, compared with almost 121,000 a year on average between 2015 and 2019, a fall of 2%. There were nearly 140,000 male deaths in hospital in 2020, 10% above the five-year average of 127,000, reflecting the higher number of male deaths due to COVID-19. \nMales accounted for the largest share of excess deaths from any cause in England, at 18% above the five-year average compared with 11% for females. In Wales, male deaths were 14% above the average and female deaths were 10% above the average. \nData download\nDeaths due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) were highest among the oldest age groups. \nOverall excess deaths, the percentage above the average for the previous five years, followed a similar pattern. There was also a higher percentage of excess deaths among males than females from the ages of 45 to 49 years onwards in England. \nHowever, the percentage of excess deaths in both England and Wales among those aged 65 to 69 years was the lowest of any age group above 40 to 44 years. \nExcess deaths in England among those aged 65 to 69 years were 7% above the average for males and 2% above the average for females, compared with 1% above average for males and 2% below average for females in Wales. \nAmong the next age group down, 60 to 64 years, excess deaths were 18% above average for males and 14% above average for females in England while among the group aged 70 to 74 years they were 21% above average for males and 17% above average for females. \nIn Wales, deaths among males aged 60 to 64 years were 10% above average and for females 14% above average in 2020 while for those aged 70 to 74 years deaths were 15% above average for males and 18% above average for females. \nAlso in Wales, deaths of females aged 35 to 39 years were 47% higher than expected, with 105 registered in 2020 compared with a five-year average of around 71. Four deaths registered in 2020 in this age group, among males and females, were due to COVID-19. \nData download\nMore detailed information on excess deaths can be found in our accompanying dataset. In addition, more detailed analyses of excess deaths in England and Wales are produced by Public Health England and Public Health Wales. \nIn this article, \u201cexcess\u201d deaths are defined as the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the 2015 to 2019 average. The average provides a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a usual year. A five-year period was used because there has been relatively little year-on-year population change over the last five years (less than 1% increase each year). \nZ-scores demonstrate how mortality in 2020 differed from the five-year average. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations the observed number of deaths (registered in 2020) is from the average (2015 to 2019). Z-scores can be used to determine statistical significance. In this analysis, a Z-score of 0 means the number of deaths in 2020 was the same as the five-year average. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines coronaviruses as \"a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\". Between 2001 and 2018, there were 12 deaths in England and Wales due to a coronavirus infection. COVID-19 refers to the \"coronavirus disease 2019\" and is a disease caused by a specific type of coronavirus. \nDeaths \"due to COVID-19\" are deaths registered in England and Wales where COVID-19 was the underlying (main) cause on the death certificate. A doctor can certify the involvement of COVID-19 based on symptoms and clinical findings \u2013 a positive test result is not required. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD-10) codes U.071, U.072, and U10.9 are included in our \"due to COVID-19\" definition. This article uses finalised mortality data for 2020, so numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 differ from figures in other publications based on provisional data, such as weekly deaths. \nThe ONS has a short list for cause of death, developed in consultation with the Department of Health and Social Care, and based on one developed by the\u202fWHO.\u202fThis list uses more specific groupings than the broad group level, splitting causes such as cancer and circulatory diseases into different subtypes, to provide policymakers with enough detail to generate appropriate health policies.\u202fIn this article,\u202fshort list cause\u202fgroups\u202fwith\u202funder\u202f1,000 deaths in 2020 were merged\u202fwith other groups to reduce problems associated with small counts. For more information on the groupings used see the Definitions tab of the accompanying dataset. \nThis analysis focuses on the underlying cause of death only. Multiple health conditions that contributed to a death can be mentioned on the death certificate, and from these a single underlying (main) cause of death is derived using a set of rules. Information on pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19 is available based on provisional data. \nThis analysis focuses on deaths registered in 2020; there is a delay between a death happening and it being registered, so some of the 2020 death registrations will have occurred in previous years. Deaths from external causes, such as accidents, violence and suicides can only be registered after investigation by a coroner. This process has been impacted by the pandemic, affecting the number of death registrations in 2020 from these causes. \nMore quality and methodology information is available in the Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI and the User Guide to Mortality Statistics. \nStatistical bulletin| Released on 21 April 2022\nProvisional counts of the number of deaths registered in England and Wales, including deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19), in the latest weeks for which data are available.\nStatistical bulletin| Released on 24 March 2022\nProvisional death registration data for England and Wales, broken down by sex, age and country.

While bedrooms have become offices, gardens \u2013 and the areas within walking distance of home \u2013 have become wildlife-watching spots and gyms. Nature has been a source of solace for many, as lockdown rules have heightened our appreciation for local parks and green spaces. \nDrawing on several sources, we look at the impact of lockdown on exercise levels, usage of public green spaces and the link between nature and wellbeing. \nHas the pandemic changed our relationship with the outdoors forever? \nDuring the first coronavirus lockdown, many people filled their free time with exercise. As restrictions limited other leisure activities, exercise levels increased. \nThis could partly be down to higher levels of homeworking. New analysis shows that homeworkers have been more likely to leave the house for exercise during the pandemic than people with a daily commute. \nAround one in three workers (33%) were based exclusively at home in the spring 2020 lockdown (Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) survey, 14 to 17 May 2020); this had dropped to around one in five (20%) by late summer (26 to 30 August 2020), when restrictions had been eased. \nBetween 7 and 11 April 2021, 28% of working adults worked exclusively from home. More than three-quarters (76%) of people who only worked from home in this period had left home for exercise in the previous seven days, compared with 52% of people who only travelled to work. Those working from home were also more likely to visit a park or local green space than those who travelled to work (45% compared with 30%). \nData download\nAlong with the rise in outdoor exercise, people\u2019s interest in nature surged. In May 2020, 36% of people responding to the People and Nature Survey by Natural England said they were spending more time outside during the pandemic than before. This rose to 46% in July 2020. \nCharities such as the RSPB and the Wildlife Trust saw spikes in web traffic in the first national lockdown. Visits to the RSPB website increased by 69% year-on-year in March to May 2020 with 79% of those users being new to the website. In the same period, the RSPB recorded a tenfold increase in views of its Build a bird box web page. \nWhen lockdown restrictions lifted in summer 2020, people relied on the outdoors for leisure time and their holidays. \nWith children\u2019s playgrounds and similar places closed during lockdown, visits to parks, and time spent in them, fell in the spring, but the subsequent increase during the summer was greater in 2020 than in previous years, according to Google mobility data for the UK. \nData download\nSimilarly, while the British tourism sector struggled during summer 2020 because of limits on social contact, camping holiday sales surged year-on-year in July and August along with reports of higher sales of outdoor products such as bicycles, leisure equipment and campervans. \nWhile use of parks fell in rural and coastal areas during lockdown compared with pre-pandemic, there was a substantial rise in the summer, at least partly driven by domestic tourism. \nFor example, visits to and time spent in parks in Cornwall increased by 4% between the start of the year and lockdown, but then went on to rise by 280% between the start of the year and September, with similar patterns in Devon, Norfolk and East Yorkshire. High Peak and Ribble Valley are notable as two rural areas that saw high mobility both during lockdown and in September. \nData download\nIsolation, along with other factors, contributed to a decline in mental health over the last year. \nThis is reflected by lower personal well-being scores during lockdown periods \u2013 and throughout the pandemic \u2013 compared with before. However, there is evidence that the natural environment has helped some people to cope with negative feelings such as increased anxiety. \nAround 9 in 10 people surveyed by Natural England in May 2020 agreed that natural spaces are good for mental health and wellbeing. More than 40% noticed that nature, wildlife, and visiting local green and natural spaces have been even more important to their wellbeing since the coronavirus restrictions began. These percentages have remained stable throughout the pandemic. \nLocal green and natural spaces have been important for well-being during the pandemicProportion of adults that have noticed or done the following since coronavirus restrictions were introduced, England, February 2021Source: Natural England \u2013 People and Nature SurveyNotes:Question: \u201cThinking about life since the coronavirus restrictions began, have you noticed or done any of the following?\u201dRespondents can select multiple options so percentages will not sum to 100%.Download this chart Local green and natural spaces have been important for well-being during the pandemicImage.csv.xls\nGreen and outdoor spaces also appear to have played an important role in allowing people to see their loved ones during periods of isolation. \nThe percentage of people increasing their time spent connecting with family and friends outdoors grew over lockdown, from 11% in May to 22% in July. This increase in summer persisted until January when it dropped to 19%. \nHowever, not everyone has equal access to the green space they need to improve their personal wellbeing. \nThere is a clear connection between how people have been using the outdoors under coronavirus restrictions and the distance between green spaces and their doorstep. \nWe can use Google mobility data to compare visits and time spent in parks and other natural spaces across different communities, during and after the first national lockdown. \nIn lockdown, those living closer to their nearest public green space were more likely to visit than those living further away. In the summer, after lockdown, the opposite was true, with people living further away from their nearest green space more likely to visit than those living closer. \nData download\nData also indicate a trade-off between private and public green space. Households in areas of the country with least access to private gardens are generally more likely to live close to a public park. \nIn London, one in five (21%) households has no access to a private or shared garden, compared with 12% of households across Great Britain. And for those in London that do have access to a private garden, their gardens are 26% smaller than the national average. \nHowever, 44% of London residents are within an estimated five-minute walk of a park (this rises to 58% if playing fields are included). Both are the highest of any region or country in Great Britain. \nDuring the first lockdown in April, use of public green space increased in London (compared with a normal year), contrasting with falls elsewhere. The largest declines were seen in Wales and Scotland. This may be due to different restrictions in the respective countries \u2013 in normal times people in Wales are most likely to spend time outdoors. \nUse of parks was lower than normal in Wales and Scotland during the spring 2020 lockdownDifference between percent change in mobility to parks and public green spaces compared with a baseline period in 2020 and a normal year (0 represents use of parks in a normal year), 23 March to 4 July 2020 Source: Google \u2013 COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, Natural England \u2013 Monitor of Engagement with the Natural EnvironmentNotes:The chart compares data from Google (2020) with Natural England (2009 to 2018).

Estimates of normalised mobility for Scotland and Wales are based on seasonal changes in visit data for the whole of England.Download this chart Use of parks was lower than normal in Wales and Scotland during the spring 2020 lockdownImage.csv.xls\nOf course, access to nearby green space does not guarantee that it is of sufficient quality (to want to spend time in) and size (to be able to maintain social distance). \nA significant percentage (around 40%) of the population were concerned about overcrowding and not being able to keep their distance from others when visiting their local green and natural spaces, according to analysis of Natural England\u2019s People and Nature Survey by the New Economics Foundation (NEF). \nThe average park in Great Britain serves just under 2,000 people, although some parks in densely populated areas such as London cater for many more people. Around 46,000 people in London have Clapham Common as their nearest park, more than 20 times the average. \nThe NEF analysis that highlighted concerns about overcrowding found that around one in eight people (12.5%) don\u2019t believe that their local green space is of a high enough standard to want to spend time in. People on lower incomes report greater dissatisfaction with the quality of their green space than those on higher incomes. \nThe quality of nearby green space may have affected the way people spent their time during lockdown. According to our Time Use Survey, people in high-income households were spending twice as long keeping fit in April 2020 \u2013 through exercise classes and gym, running and jogging, team sports, and other sport \u2013 as those in low-income households (32 minutes per day compared with 16 minutes). \nThose from high-income households increased their time spent keeping fit by 36% during lockdown compared with 2015 (the most recent pre-pandemic data). In contrast, people from low-income households spent the same amount of time on fitness as before. \nData download\nThe pandemic has underlined the importance of outdoor space, for people and policymakers. \nIn October 2020, the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) asked companies about homeworking as a future business model. Around 1 in 6 (17%) businesses intended to move to homeworking permanently, with 61% of these pointing to improved staff wellbeing as a reason for the change. \nThis could explain why our housing preferences are changing. Growth in sales of detached houses is outstripping that of flats. Meanwhile, Cornwall has overtaken London as the most searched-for location on Rightmove this year, with Devon and Dorset also in the top 10. \nHowever, the interest in nature that we saw in spring and summer 2020 has not necessarily carried through to winter 2020 and early 2021. A University College London (UCL) survey suggests that many of the lifestyle changes adopted during the first national lockdown had slipped, with people instead spending more time watching television, which may be unsurprising because of the colder and darker weather. \nIt could be that the people most likely to maintain lockdown lifestyle changes, such as increased exercise and visits to green spaces, are those whose circumstances most allow them to, such as those whose workplaces decide to offer homeworking permanently. \nIf businesses were to carry out their plans to continue offering homeworking following the pandemic, it could lead to an influx of wealthier people of working age (the demographic who are more likely to spend time in nature recreationally) moving to rural and coastal areas. \nMidway through September 2020, around 3 in 10 (29%) working adults said that they intend to continue working from home after the pandemic all or most of the time. Among those people, 12% said they had considered relocating, mostly to rural or coastal areas, places that typically have a high percentage of retired people. \nAt the time of the 2011 census, the distribution of homeworkers was most concentrated in small coastal communities such as Tintagel, Porlock and Lynton in the South West (30 to 35%) and certain rural areas such as West Somerset, Ceredigion and Powys (22 to 26%). The 2021 Census, carried out last month, will provide data on how this has changed. \nLockdown has disrupted our relationship with nature, from propelling us to find new appreciation for our natural surroundings to highlighting societal inequalities that exist in access to green space. \nShifts in personal behaviour and corporate attitudes could mean that the UK, post-lockdown, will value and interact with nature on a much greater scale than before the pandemic. \nWhat we do not yet know is whether the changes brought on by lockdown will be a temporary trend, or a new way of life. \nGoogle defines \u201cmobility\u201d as visits to and time spent at a categorised area. The category of parks includes public gardens, national forests, campgrounds, and other outdoor spaces. This does not refer to the general outdoors found in rural areas. To understand mobility trends during the coronavirus pandemic, Google compares mobility on a given weekday to the median mobility on that weekday in a five-week period before the pandemic (the baseline). This baseline period is from 3 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. The mobility figure for a given day is the percentage change in mobility compared with the corresponding median for that day in the baseline period. \nThe baseline period occurs in winter, when there are fewer visits to parks. Without coronavirus restrictions, we would expect visits to parks to increase in the spring and summer. \nUsing historical data from the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey we attempt to normalise for seasonal changes in mobility to parks. MENE data cover England only and counts the number of short visits made by residents of a region. Estimates for Scotland and Wales are based on visit data for the whole of England. Google mobility data includes overnight tourism, so for the post-lockdown period where restrictions on overnight stays had been lifted, normalisation is less effective. \nThe lockdown period referred to in this article is from 23 March 2020 to 4 July 2020. For each geography, an average percent change in mobility from the baseline is taken across all dates for which data are available. The number of dates from which an average is taken varies by geography. This is repeated for a post-lockdown period, which is from 5 July 2020 to 4 September 2020. Mobility data are available for all Google geographies in the lockdown period (350 Local Authority Districts and two Counties), but there are 13 geographies for which post-lockdown mobility data are unavailable. \nWe use Ordnance Survey data to estimate access to local greenspaces across Great Britain. This is done at postcode level, with business and rural postcodes removed to show data for residential urban areas only. Urban postcodes are most appropriate for estimates of proximity to greenspace and linking with the google mobility data. We also provide data tables for all residential postcodes (including rural). This postcode level data are aggregated to larger geographies and weighted on LSOA level population data from the 2011 Census. Two datasets are used to measure the minimum and maximum level of public access to greenspace. One contains \u201cparks\u201d and \u201cpublic gardens\u201d; the other also contains \u201cplaying fields\u201d which may be private. \nAccess to private gardens data are matched to access to greenspace data on postcode. The average garden size for flats at postcode level are estimated from MSOA level aggregates. The average garden size for flats and houses at larger geographies are aggregated from postcode level and weighted on both LSOA level population data and the number of flats or houses in that geography. \nStatistical bulletin| Released on 1 April 2022\nIndicators from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (covering 16 to 27 March 2022) of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain.\nArticle| Released on 14 May 2020\nThe percentage of homes without a garden is higher among ethnic minorities, with Black people in England nearly four times as likely as White people to have no outdoor space at home.\nAll content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated\n", "summary": "People spent more time doing outdoor activities during lockdowns\n26 April 2021\nThe proportion of people leaving home for exercise increased during lockdown periods, as restrictions limited other leisure activities. \nNew analysis of data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) suggests that the rise in exercise was at least partly driven by people working from home, who have been more likely to leave the house for exercise than those who travel to work each day. \nDownload the data\nIn July 2020, 46% of people surveyed by Natural England said they spent more time outside than usual during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nData from Natural England indicate that some people turned to nature to cope with feelings such as increased anxiety, with 41% of people saying that visits to natural spaces were more important to their wellbeing in May 2020 compared with before the pandemic. \nDecisions to make homeworking permanent by some businesses have allowed many people to think about moving closer to higher quality green space.

Many deaths not due to COVID-19, which would normally have occurred in hospital, happened in private homes instead. \n7 May 2021\nDeaths in private homes, from all causes, were one-third higher in 2020 than in the previous five years. There were around 167,000 deaths from all causes in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with an average of 125,000 between 2015 and 2019. \nThe majority of deaths due to COVID-19 (where the coronavirus was the main cause) occurred in hospitals and care homes, while many deaths from other causes, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, happened in private homes. Our analysis shows that many of these deaths at home were people who, in a non-pandemic year, may have typically died elsewhere such as in hospital. \nDeaths in hospital were 4% above the five-year average. However, if deaths due to COVID-19 are excluded, then deaths in hospitals would have been 16% lower than the average. \nOur first release of the finalised mortality data for 2020 shows that \u201cexcess deaths\u201d from all causes were 14% above the five-year average in England and Wales, with the coronavirus (COVID-19) being the main reason for excess deaths. \nExcess deaths are the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Using the average gives us a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a \"usual\" year, before the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThere were almost 76,000 more deaths from all causes and in all locations (hospitals, care homes, private homes and elsewhere) in England and Wales in 2020 than the five-year average. COVID-19 was responsible for 97% of the excess, having not previously existed. \nThis analysis looks at England and Wales as a whole; trends for the two countries may differ and are shown separately in the charts and data tables. \nData download\nMore than half (around 41,000) of the 76,000 excess deaths, from all causes, in England and Wales in 2020 occurred in private homes. A further 25,000 occurred in care homes. \nThe contribution of COVID-19 to this increase in deaths in private homes is small, at just over 3,000. The increase of non-COVID-19 deaths in private homes is 30% above the five-year average. \nCare homes recorded a 21% rise in deaths from all causes, with nearly 25,000 more than expected \u2014 almost 19,000 of them due to COVID-19. Excluding the coronavirus, other care home deaths were 5% up on the five-year average. \nIn hospitals, which were under significant pressure because of numbers of patients with the coronavirus, there were around 258,000 deaths from all causes, 10,000 (4%) more than the five-year average. \nDeaths in hospital from causes other than COVID-19 fell by more than 40,000 (16%). \nThe new coronavirus (COVID-19) was the underlying cause of almost 74,000 deaths in 2020.

Looking at Wales specifically, deaths not due to COVID-19 in 2020 (33,000) were slightly below the average (33,400). \nThe next highest number of deaths registered in 2020 were \"dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease\", \"ischaemic heart diseases\", \"cerebrovascular diseases\" (stroke) and certain types of cancer, which is similar to recent years. \nDeaths from different types of cancer (\"malignant neoplasms\") are recorded separately. This is because cancer is a term that describes a collection of related diseases that vary widely in their behaviour and response to treatment. \nData download\nThe most significant rise in deaths based on the previous five years was from \"chronic rheumatic heart diseases\", with just under 1,100 deaths registered in 2020, 36% higher when compared with 789 a year on average between 2015 and 2019. \n\"Cirrhosis and other diseases of the liver\" caused almost 9,700 deaths, compared with an average of 8,300 between 2015 and 2019. Though deaths from this cause had generally been increasing over time prior to the pandemic, the rise between 2019 and 2020 was larger than seen in recent years. Proportionally, the biggest shift in deaths by this cause was in deaths in private homes, with nearly 2,400 in 2020 compared with an expected 1,800 (a rise of 31%). Analysis from Public Health England and academic studies has suggested that alcohol consumption in higher-risk drinkers increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact on mortality. \nIncreases in deaths from these causes were the highest above the expected range, using z-scores. \nThe z-scores are a more meaningful measure than percentage changes, which can be skewed by small numbers. \nThere were 8,000 fewer deaths in England and Wales than expected from \"influenza and pneumonia\", likely due in part to social distancing reducing the spread. \n\"Bronchitis, emphysema and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\" and \"renal failure\" were the underlying causes of death that fell the farthest below what was expected based on their five-year averages. \nData download\nBreast cancer deaths (\"malignant neoplasms of breast\") were broadly in line with the 2015 to 2019 average. There were 10,385 deaths compared with an average of just over 10,200. \nHowever, more breast cancer deaths were registered in private homes than in hospitals, compared with the five-year average. \nThere were just over 3,900 breast cancer deaths in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with just over 2,800 in hospitals. This compares with an average of just under 2,900 deaths at home and 3,400 deaths in hospital per year between 2015 and 2019. \nFor prostate cancer (\"malignant neoplasm of prostate\"), 4,700 deaths out of a total of nearly 11,000 were in private homes in 2020 and just under 2,900 were in hospitals, compared with 3,300 in private homes and 3,600 in hospitals on average between 2015 and 2019. \n\"Parkinson\u2019s disease\" and \"diabetes\" deaths in private homes were up, by 66% for \"Parkinson\u2019s disease\" (616 excess deaths) and by 60% for \"diabetes\" (894 excess deaths). \nDeaths due to \"influenza and pneumonia\" in private homes were 8% below the five-year average. \nData download\nThere were more deaths (from all causes) in private homes in each month of 2020 than in a normal year, after the coronavirus pandemic struck in March. \nWhile the peak in excess deaths in care homes during April 2020 was much higher than in private homes, deaths remained above average in private homes for the rest of the year. Deaths other than in private homes in England fell below the five-year average during July and August 2020 while in Wales this happened in August and September 2020. \nData download\nIn 2020, 89,000 people aged 85 years and over died in hospitals in England and Wales while 94,000 died in care homes and 50,000 in private homes. \nThe number of people aged 85 years and over dying in hospital was slightly below the five-year average during 2020. However, among this age group, almost 31,000 more people than expected died in private homes and care homes. \nDeaths, from all causes, recorded in private homes among people aged 85 years and over were 43% above the five-year average in England and 38% above average in Wales during 2020. In care homes, the number of excess deaths came to 20% in England and 22% in Wales. \nAt the same time, deaths in hospital from all causes among those aged 85 years and over fell slightly, while deaths in age groups 45 to 64 years and 75 to 84 years increased in both England and Wales. Hospital deaths among the age group 65 to 74 years increased in England but not in Wales. \nData download\nThere were 258,000 deaths from all causes in hospitals in England and Wales in 2020, 10,000 (4%) up on the five-year average.

There were nearly 140,000 male deaths in hospital in 2020, 10% above the five-year average of 127,000, reflecting the higher number of male deaths due to COVID-19. \nMales accounted for the largest share of excess deaths from any cause in England, at 18% above the five-year average compared with 11% for females. In Wales, male deaths were 14% above the average and female deaths were 10% above the average. \nData download\nDeaths due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) were highest among the oldest age groups. \nOverall excess deaths, the percentage above the average for the previous five years, followed a similar pattern. There was also a higher percentage of excess deaths among males than females from the ages of 45 to 49 years onwards in England. \nHowever, the percentage of excess deaths in both England and Wales among those aged 65 to 69 years was the lowest of any age group above 40 to 44 years. \nExcess deaths in England among those aged 65 to 69 years were 7% above the average for males and 2% above the average for females, compared with 1% above average for males and 2% below average for females in Wales. \nAmong the next age group down, 60 to 64 years, excess deaths were 18% above average for males and 14% above average for females in England while among the group aged 70 to 74 years they were 21% above average for males and 17% above average for females. \nIn Wales, deaths among males aged 60 to 64 years were 10% above average and for females 14% above average in 2020 while for those aged 70 to 74 years deaths were 15% above average for males and 18% above average for females. \nAlso in Wales, deaths of females aged 35 to 39 years were 47% higher than expected, with 105 registered in 2020 compared with a five-year average of around 71. Four deaths registered in 2020 in this age group, among males and females, were due to COVID-19. \nData download\nMore detailed information on excess deaths can be found in our accompanying dataset. In addition, more detailed analyses of excess deaths in England and Wales are produced by Public Health England and Public Health Wales. \nIn this article, \u201cexcess\u201d deaths are defined as the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the 2015 to 2019 average. The average provides a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a usual year. A five-year period was used because there has been relatively little year-on-year population change over the last five years (less than 1% increase each year). \nZ-scores demonstrate how mortality in 2020 differed from the five-year average. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations the observed number of deaths (registered in 2020) is from the average (2015 to 2019). Z-scores can be used to determine statistical significance. In this analysis, a Z-score of 0 means the number of deaths in 2020 was the same as the five-year average. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines coronaviruses as \"a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\". Between 2001 and 2018, there were 12 deaths in England and Wales due to a coronavirus infection. COVID-19 refers to the \"coronavirus disease 2019\" and is a disease caused by a specific type of coronavirus. \nDeaths \"due to COVID-19\" are deaths registered in England and Wales where COVID-19 was the underlying (main) cause on the death certificate. A doctor can certify the involvement of COVID-19 based on symptoms and clinical findings \u2013 a positive test result is not required. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD-10) codes U.071, U.072, and U10.9 are included in our \"due to COVID-19\" definition. This article uses finalised mortality data for 2020, so numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 differ from figures in other publications based on provisional data, such as weekly deaths. \nThe ONS has a short list for cause of death, developed in consultation with the Department of Health and Social Care, and based on one developed by the\u202fWHO.\u202fThis list uses more specific groupings than the broad group level, splitting causes such as cancer and circulatory diseases into different subtypes, to provide policymakers with enough detail to generate appropriate health policies.\u202fIn this article,\u202fshort list cause\u202fgroups\u202fwith\u202funder\u202f1,000 deaths in 2020 were merged\u202fwith other groups to reduce problems associated with small counts. For more information on the groupings used see the Definitions tab of the accompanying dataset. \nThis analysis focuses on the underlying cause of death only. Multiple health conditions that contributed to a death can be mentioned on the death certificate, and from these a single underlying (main) cause of death is derived using a set of rules. Information on pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19 is available based on provisional data. \nThis analysis focuses on deaths registered in 2020; there is a delay between a death happening and it being registered, so some of the 2020 death registrations will have occurred in previous years. Deaths from external causes, such as accidents, violence and suicides can only be registered after investigation by a coroner. This process has been impacted by the pandemic, affecting the number of death registrations in 2020 from these causes. \nMore quality and methodology information is available in the Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI and the User Guide to Mortality Statistics. \nStatistical bulletin| Released on 21 April 2022\nProvisional counts of the number of deaths registered in England and Wales, including deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19), in the latest weeks for which data are available.\nStatistical bulletin| Released on 24 March 2022\nProvisional death registration data for England and Wales, broken down by sex, age and country.

While bedrooms have become offices, gardens \u2013 and the areas within walking distance of home \u2013 have become wildlife-watching spots and gyms. Nature has been a source of solace for many, as lockdown rules have heightened our appreciation for local parks and green spaces. \nDrawing on several sources, we look at the impact of lockdown on exercise levels, usage of public green spaces and the link between nature and wellbeing. \nHas the pandemic changed our relationship with the outdoors forever? \nDuring the first coronavirus lockdown, many people filled their free time with exercise. As restrictions limited other leisure activities, exercise levels increased. \nThis could partly be down to higher levels of homeworking. New analysis shows that homeworkers have been more likely to leave the house for exercise during the pandemic than people with a daily commute. \nAround one in three workers (33%) were based exclusively at home in the spring 2020 lockdown (Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) survey, 14 to 17 May 2020); this had dropped to around one in five (20%) by late summer (26 to 30 August 2020), when restrictions had been eased. \nBetween 7 and 11 April 2021, 28% of working adults worked exclusively from home. More than three-quarters (76%) of people who only worked from home in this period had left home for exercise in the previous seven days, compared with 52% of people who only travelled to work. Those working from home were also more likely to visit a park or local green space than those who travelled to work (45% compared with 30%). \nData download\nAlong with the rise in outdoor exercise, people\u2019s interest in nature surged. In May 2020, 36% of people responding to the People and Nature Survey by Natural England said they were spending more time outside during the pandemic than before. This rose to 46% in July 2020. \nCharities such as the RSPB and the Wildlife Trust saw spikes in web traffic in the first national lockdown. Visits to the RSPB website increased by 69% year-on-year in March to May 2020 with 79% of those users being new to the website. In the same period, the RSPB recorded a tenfold increase in views of its Build a bird box web page. \nWhen lockdown restrictions lifted in summer 2020, people relied on the outdoors for leisure time and their holidays. \nWith children\u2019s playgrounds and similar places closed during lockdown, visits to parks, and time spent in them, fell in the spring, but the subsequent increase during the summer was greater in 2020 than in previous years, according to Google mobility data for the UK. \nData download\nSimilarly, while the British tourism sector struggled during summer 2020 because of limits on social contact, camping holiday sales surged year-on-year in July and August along with reports of higher sales of outdoor products such as bicycles, leisure equipment and campervans. \nWhile use of parks fell in rural and coastal areas during lockdown compared with pre-pandemic, there was a substantial rise in the summer, at least partly driven by domestic tourism. \nFor example, visits to and time spent in parks in Cornwall increased by 4% between the start of the year and lockdown, but then went on to rise by 280% between the start of the year and September, with similar patterns in Devon, Norfolk and East Yorkshire. High Peak and Ribble Valley are notable as two rural areas that saw high mobility both during lockdown and in September. \nData download\nIsolation, along with other factors, contributed to a decline in mental health over the last year. \nThis is reflected by lower personal well-being scores during lockdown periods \u2013 and throughout the pandemic \u2013 compared with before. However, there is evidence that the natural environment has helped some people to cope with negative feelings such as increased anxiety. \nAround 9 in 10 people surveyed by Natural England in May 2020 agreed that natural spaces are good for mental health and wellbeing. More than 40% noticed that nature, wildlife, and visiting local green and natural spaces have been even more important to their wellbeing since the coronavirus restrictions began. These percentages have remained stable throughout the pandemic. \nLocal green and natural spaces have been important for well-being during the pandemicProportion of adults that have noticed or done the following since coronavirus restrictions were introduced, England, February 2021Source: Natural England \u2013 People and Nature SurveyNotes:Question: \u201cThinking about life since the coronavirus restrictions began, have you noticed or done any of the following?\u201dRespondents can select multiple options so percentages will not sum to 100%.Download this chart Local green and natural spaces have been important for well-being during the pandemicImage.csv.xls\nGreen and outdoor spaces also appear to have played an important role in allowing people to see their loved ones during periods of isolation. \nThe percentage of people increasing their time spent connecting with family and friends outdoors grew over lockdown, from 11% in May to 22% in July. This increase in summer persisted until January when it dropped to 19%. \nHowever, not everyone has equal access to the green space they need to improve their personal wellbeing. \nThere is a clear connection between how people have been using the outdoors under coronavirus restrictions and the distance between green spaces and their doorstep. \nWe can use Google mobility data to compare visits and time spent in parks and other natural spaces across different communities, during and after the first national lockdown. \nIn lockdown, those living closer to their nearest public green space were more likely to visit than those living further away. In the summer, after lockdown, the opposite was true, with people living further away from their nearest green space more likely to visit than those living closer. \nData download\nData also indicate a trade-off between private and public green space. Households in areas of the country with least access to private gardens are generally more likely to live close to a public park. \nIn London, one in five (21%) households has no access to a private or shared garden, compared with 12% of households across Great Britain. And for those in London that do have access to a private garden, their gardens are 26% smaller than the national average. \nHowever, 44% of London residents are within an estimated five-minute walk of a park (this rises to 58% if playing fields are included). Both are the highest of any region or country in Great Britain. \nDuring the first lockdown in April, use of public green space increased in London (compared with a normal year), contrasting with falls elsewhere. The largest declines were seen in Wales and Scotland. This may be due to different restrictions in the respective countries \u2013 in normal times people in Wales are most likely to spend time outdoors. \nUse of parks was lower than normal in Wales and Scotland during the spring 2020 lockdownDifference between percent change in mobility to parks and public green spaces compared with a baseline period in 2020 and a normal year (0 represents use of parks in a normal year), 23 March to 4 July 2020 Source: Google \u2013 COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, Natural England \u2013 Monitor of Engagement with the Natural EnvironmentNotes:The chart compares data from Google (2020) with Natural England (2009 to 2018).

Around 46,000 people in London have Clapham Common as their nearest park, more than 20 times the average. \nThe NEF analysis that highlighted concerns about overcrowding found that around one in eight people (12.5%) don\u2019t believe that their local green space is of a high enough standard to want to spend time in. People on lower incomes report greater dissatisfaction with the quality of their green space than those on higher incomes. \nThe quality of nearby green space may have affected the way people spent their time during lockdown. According to our Time Use Survey, people in high-income households were spending twice as long keeping fit in April 2020 \u2013 through exercise classes and gym, running and jogging, team sports, and other sport \u2013 as those in low-income households (32 minutes per day compared with 16 minutes). \nThose from high-income households increased their time spent keeping fit by 36% during lockdown compared with 2015 (the most recent pre-pandemic data). In contrast, people from low-income households spent the same amount of time on fitness as before. \nData download\nThe pandemic has underlined the importance of outdoor space, for people and policymakers. \nIn October 2020, the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) asked companies about homeworking as a future business model. Around 1 in 6 (17%) businesses intended to move to homeworking permanently, with 61% of these pointing to improved staff wellbeing as a reason for the change. \nThis could explain why our housing preferences are changing. Growth in sales of detached houses is outstripping that of flats. Meanwhile, Cornwall has overtaken London as the most searched-for location on Rightmove this year, with Devon and Dorset also in the top 10. \nHowever, the interest in nature that we saw in spring and summer 2020 has not necessarily carried through to winter 2020 and early 2021. A University College London (UCL) survey suggests that many of the lifestyle changes adopted during the first national lockdown had slipped, with people instead spending more time watching television, which may be unsurprising because of the colder and darker weather. \nIt could be that the people most likely to maintain lockdown lifestyle changes, such as increased exercise and visits to green spaces, are those whose circumstances most allow them to, such as those whose workplaces decide to offer homeworking permanently. \nIf businesses were to carry out their plans to continue offering homeworking following the pandemic, it could lead to an influx of wealthier people of working age (the demographic who are more likely to spend time in nature recreationally) moving to rural and coastal areas. \nMidway through September 2020, around 3 in 10 (29%) working adults said that they intend to continue working from home after the pandemic all or most of the time. Among those people, 12% said they had considered relocating, mostly to rural or coastal areas, places that typically have a high percentage of retired people. \nAt the time of the 2011 census, the distribution of homeworkers was most concentrated in small coastal communities such as Tintagel, Porlock and Lynton in the South West (30 to 35%) and certain rural areas such as West Somerset, Ceredigion and Powys (22 to 26%). The 2021 Census, carried out last month, will provide data on how this has changed. \nLockdown has disrupted our relationship with nature, from propelling us to find new appreciation for our natural surroundings to highlighting societal inequalities that exist in access to green space. \nShifts in personal behaviour and corporate attitudes could mean that the UK, post-lockdown, will value and interact with nature on a much greater scale than before the pandemic. \nWhat we do not yet know is whether the changes brought on by lockdown will be a temporary trend, or a new way of life. \nGoogle defines \u201cmobility\u201d as visits to and time spent at a categorised area. The category of parks includes public gardens, national forests, campgrounds, and other outdoor spaces. This does not refer to the general outdoors found in rural areas. To understand mobility trends during the coronavirus pandemic, Google compares mobility on a given weekday to the median mobility on that weekday in a five-week period before the pandemic (the baseline). This baseline period is from 3 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. The mobility figure for a given day is the percentage change in mobility compared with the corresponding median for that day in the baseline period. \nThe baseline period occurs in winter, when there are fewer visits to parks. Without coronavirus restrictions, we would expect visits to parks to increase in the spring and summer. \nUsing historical data from the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey we attempt to normalise for seasonal changes in mobility to parks. MENE data cover England only and counts the number of short visits made by residents of a region. Estimates for Scotland and Wales are based on visit data for the whole of England. Google mobility data includes overnight tourism, so for the post-lockdown period where restrictions on overnight stays had been lifted, normalisation is less effective. \nThe lockdown period referred to in this article is from 23 March 2020 to 4 July 2020. For each geography, an average percent change in mobility from the baseline is taken across all dates for which data are available. The number of dates from which an average is taken varies by geography. This is repeated for a post-lockdown period, which is from 5 July 2020 to 4 September 2020. Mobility data are available for all Google geographies in the lockdown period (350 Local Authority Districts and two Counties), but there are 13 geographies for which post-lockdown mobility data are unavailable. \nWe use Ordnance Survey data to estimate access to local greenspaces across Great Britain. This is done at postcode level, with business and rural postcodes removed to show data for residential urban areas only. Urban postcodes are most appropriate for estimates of proximity to greenspace and linking with the google mobility data. We also provide data tables for all residential postcodes (including rural). This postcode level data are aggregated to larger geographies and weighted on LSOA level population data from the 2011 Census. Two datasets are used to measure the minimum and maximum level of public access to greenspace. One contains \u201cparks\u201d and \u201cpublic gardens\u201d; the other also contains \u201cplaying fields\u201d which may be private. \nAccess to private gardens data are matched to access to greenspace data on postcode. The average garden size for flats at postcode level are estimated from MSOA level aggregates. The average garden size for flats and houses at larger geographies are aggregated from postcode level and weighted on both LSOA level population data and the number of flats or houses in that geography. \nStatistical bulletin| Released on 1 April 2022\nIndicators from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (covering 16 to 27 March 2022) of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain.\nArticle| Released on 14 May 2020\nThe percentage of homes without a garden is higher among ethnic minorities, with Black people in England nearly four times as likely as White people to have no outdoor space at home.\nAll content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated\n", "summary": "People spent more time doing outdoor activities during lockdowns\nThe proportion of people leaving home for exercise increased during lockdown periods, as restrictions limited other leisure activities. \nNew analysis of data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) suggests that the rise in exercise was at least partly driven by people working from home, who have been more likely to leave the house for exercise than those who travel to work each day. \nIn July 2020, 46% of people surveyed by Natural England said they spent more time outside than usual during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nData from Natural England indicate that some people turned to nature to cope with feelings such as increased anxiety, with 41% of people saying that visits to natural spaces were more important to their wellbeing in May 2020 compared with before the pandemic. \nDecisions to make homeworking permanent by some businesses have allowed many people to think about moving closer to higher quality green space.

The OPN's highest income bracket is an individual's income of \u00a336,500 a year or more before tax.

Personal annual gross income is self-reported on the OPN survey and therefore should be treated with caution. A respondent\u2019s income information does not represent equivalised household income, which takes into account all income from all household members, and adjusts for that fact that households with more people will need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members. \nA parent in the study is defined as someone who was a parent or legal guardian of one or more children aged under 16 years, while in the OPN data an adult is defined as a parent if they are the parent of a dependent child living in their household.

This follows the recent dip seen in January 2021 (Highways England).\nIn the week to 4 April 2021, the average number of daily ship visits remained unchanged from the previous week at 356, whereas the average number of daily cargo and tanker ship visits decreased by 6% over this period to 101 visits (exactEarth).\nThere were 15,069 company incorporations in the UK in the week to 2 April 2021, an 11% decrease from the previous week and the lowest level recorded in 2021 to date. The main reason for this lower volume is the impact of the Easter bank holiday, as we are comparing a four-day working week with a five-day working week. Therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting this week's data (Companies House).\nThere were 5,170 voluntary dissolution applications in the UK in the week to 2 April, a 14% decrease from the previous week and the lowest level seen since the week ending 22 January 2021.

Between 3 April and 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people (about 2.6 million adults) said that they felt lonely \u201coften\u201d or \u201calways\u201d. From October 2020 to February 2021, results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) show that proportion increased to 7.2% of the adult population (about 3.7 million adults). \nMapping trends across the country also shows the types of places where a higher proportion of people felt lonely often or always, and differences in personal well-being. Areas with a higher concentration of younger people (aged 16-24) and areas with higher rates of unemployment tended to have higher rates of loneliness during the study period (October 2020 to February 2021). \nLocal authorities in countryside areas also had a lower loneliness rate than urban, industrial, or other types of area. \nPlaces with a lower average (median) age generally experienced higher rates of loneliness during the pandemic, that is, a greater percentage of people in that area said they \u201coften or always\u201d felt lonely. Higher rates of loneliness reported by young people are particularly associated with urban areas outside London.\nData download\nAge and marital status are known to be significant factors in experiences of loneliness. Pre-pandemic, those aged 16 to 24 years, renting, and single were more likely to say they often felt lonely than older age groups or those who were married. \nPrevious research during the pandemic found nearly two-thirds of students have reported a worsening in their mental health and well-being. Over a quarter report feeling lonely often or always, a significantly higher amount than the adult population (8%). This is likely to be affecting loneliness scores for younger people in general at a local level. \nLiving in a single-person household, difficulties with relationships caused by the pandemic, and not having anyone to talk to have also contributed to experiences of loneliness. \nFrom October 2020 to February 2021, of those who said their well-being had been affected in the last seven days by the pandemic, 38.6% (about 10.5 million people) said it was because they were lonely. Accounting for groups we know are particularly affected by loneliness more generally, we found young people and single people have also been most affected by this seven-day measure or \u201clockdown loneliness\u201d. \nData download\nThe odds of people who said they had no one to talk to reporting lockdown loneliness were almost 10 times greater than those who did have someone to talk to. Respondents who said they felt very uncomfortable leaving the house were also more likely to report lockdown loneliness compared with those who felt very comfortable leaving the house. \nOne-person households were also more likely to report lockdown loneliness compared with two-person households. \nData download\nUnemployment has been closely tied to loneliness levels during the pandemic. This was one of the most important factors identified through our analyses. Local authority areas with a higher unemployment rate (as measured between October 2019 and September 2020) had higher proportions of residents who said they were often or always lonely (from Opinions and Lifestyle Survey results in the period from October 2020 to February 2021). Additionally, in areas where residents earn more on average per week, loneliness rates tend to be lower. \nThe effect of unemployment on loneliness is particularly strong in urban areas outside London, while in London there is no clear correlation.\nData download\nHigher unemployment in an area is also linked to higher average anxiety in that area as well as poorer life satisfaction. During the pandemic, the link between high levels of unemployment and poorer life satisfaction has become stronger.\nSome aspects of where people live appear to be connected to people feeling lonely often or always. \nWe partnered with the Centre for Thriving Places to identify local factors that might be connected to higher or lower rates of loneliness, as reported in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey.\nAreas with strong local businesses and adult education tended to have lower rates of loneliness, modelling found that local authorities in London particularly benefit from these. \nAlthough it is unclear how many of the normal benefits of local business and adult education have been accessible during the pandemic, these features of life in London may be important in helping people to connect with one another. \nPlaces which tend to have lower crime rates showed lower levels of \u201clockdown loneliness\u201d in the five months since October 2020 (people saying their well-being was affected by feeling lonely in the last seven days). The Centre for Thriving Places has a local safety measure based on crime rate. Comparing loneliness using this measure, lower crime rates in an area are connected to lower rates of loneliness. \nThis was true in countryside areas which tended to see lower levels of loneliness than higher crime urban areas.\nData download\nLoneliness has been linked to people feeling more anxious. Levels of anxiety have also broadly increased across most regions in Great Britain from pre-pandemic levels (the period April 2019 to March 2020 compared with April 2020 to September 2020). \nDuring the pandemic, how densely populated an area is has become a more important factor for anxiety in local authorities in England, with higher population density linked to higher rates of anxiety. Further research is needed but this may be because of concerns around social distancing and the perceived risk of infection. \nLocal characteristics, as measured by the Thriving Places Index, are also connected to higher or lower levels of anxiety in an area, as reported in the Annual Population Survey. \nIn the five months since October 2020, anxiety rates have increased particularly in areas assessed as having better quality provision for children\u2019s education and educational attainment prior to the pandemic. This may relate to anxieties around home schooling, or worries about children falling behind educationally among adults in these areas. It is also noted that the age group of parents overlaps with the 25 to 44 years age group, which also reported higher \"lockdown loneliness\".\nAspects of an area that are associated with lower rates of anxiety include better general health and more opportunities for cultural engagement.

On 16 March 2020, people were told to work from home wherever possible while everyone was told to \u201cavoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues\u201d, to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). \nA week later, on 23 March 2020, the UK\u2019s first lockdown would begin. From deaths and the pressure on hospitals, to the number of hours worked and people\u2019s expectations of rising unemployment, we can see how the remarkable figures recorded over the past 12 months compare with others and made this a year like no other. \nDownload the data\nMore than 140,000 people have now died in the UK with COVID-19 mentioned as the underlying cause or a contributory cause on their death certificates. \nThis includes more than 73,500 people in England and Wales whose deaths were due to COVID-19 \u2014 where it was the underlying cause \u2014 registered in 2020. Almost 4,400 further deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases were registered in 2020. COVID-19 is likely to be classed as an infectious and parasitic disease, following the precedent of similar diseases such as previous coronavirus strains (before COVID-19) and other viral infections. \nThis means COVID-19 was the underlying cause of more deaths in 2020 than any other infectious and parasitic diseases had caused in any year since 1918; that year there were just over 89,900 deaths from various infectious and parasitic diseases registered in England and Wales. \nMore recently, there were nearly 8,200 deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases in England and Wales in 2007. This coincided with a peak in deaths in England involving Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). \nThis analysis uses causes of death defined as \u201cinfectious or parasitic diseases\u201d in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), published by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Data from NHS England\u2019s winter situation reports (SitReps), show that acute hospital trusts opened significantly more critical care beds, and that many more were occupied than in recent previous years, as hospitals reported greater pressure from the coronavirus (COVID-19). \nIn the last week of January 2021, more than 5,000 adult critical care beds a day were occupied in hospitals in England, compared with around 3,000 a day in the same week in 2020. \nWhile the number of adults in critical care decreased in February 2021, it was still higher than any February over the previous decade. \nHospitals also opened significantly more critical care beds than in recent winters, ready to care for people suffering the severe effects of COVID-19. Between 20 January and 5 February 2021 there were more than 6,000 critical care beds open each day. Throughout January and February between 2017 and 2020, the number of critical care beds open ranged between 3,500 and just over 3,900. \nThe daily SitReps are submitted by acute hospital trusts every day in times of pressure on the NHS. \nDownload the data\nWith up to 8.9 million people on furlough and many businesses unable to trade as normal during lockdown, the average number of hours worked in the UK per person per week fell to 25.9 in April to June 2020, compared with 32.3 in the same three months of 2019. This was the lowest since January to March 2008, when average weekly working hours were 30.9 per person. \nAccommodation and food services industries, which included people furloughed from closed pubs, hotels and restaurants, recorded a 54% fall in average weekly hours worked in April to June 2020, with 13.0 hours per worker on average compared with 28.4 in the same three months of 2019. Other industries saw less significant falls. For example, in financial, insurance and real estate services, where many workers were likely to be able to do so from home, the average in April to June 2020 was down 6% on the same period of 2019. \nBy October to December 2020, average weekly hours worked had increased but were still down by 7% overall on the same period of 2019, with accommodation and food services down 33% as they were affected by lockdown measures, the tier system in England and rules on the numbers of people allowed to meet indoors. \nDownload the data\nThe number of UK job vacancies dropped sharply as we entered lockdown, after 23 March 2020. \nThe Vacancy Survey shows that vacancies fell 38%, from 701,000 in January to March 2008 to a low of 432,000 in April to June 2009 before rising again. \nIn comparison, quarterly vacancies stood at 802,000 across the UK in October to December 2019 and fell by 57% to a low of 343,000 in April to June 2020, during the first lockdown. By October to December 2020, the number of vacancies had risen to 590,000, down 26% on the same three months of 2019. \nMost industries recorded fewer vacancies in October to December 2020 than the same period the year before. In the accommodation and food service sector, which had been affected by lockdowns and social distancing, there were 29,000 vacancies in these three months, down 66% from 86,000 in the same three months of 2019. \nFrom supporting the wages of furloughed workers to financial help for struggling businesses, the government has pumped significant funding into coronavirus support schemes. These, combined with reduced cash receipts and a fall in gross domestic product (GDP), pushed public sector net debt as a percentage of the economy to levels last seen in the early 1960s. \nAt the end of January 2021 public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) was 97.9% of GDP.\nYou can read more on what GDP is and why it is important. \nDownload the data\nThe value of UK exports, excluding precious metals, fell by 22.5% year-on-year from \u00a3170.4 billion in the three months ending July 2019 to \u00a3132.1 billion in the same three months of 2020, while imports fell 26.1% from \u00a3176.8 billion to \u00a3130.7 billion. \nThis compared with an 8.8% year-on-year fall in the value of exports and 12.2% fall in the value of imports in the three months to July 2009 compared with the same three months of 2008, during the economic downturn. The data are in current prices and have not been adjusted for inflation. \nCertain commodities also saw significant year-on-year falls in imports and exports following the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nFuel imports in the three months ending July 2020 were down by 58.5% on the equivalent period of 2019 followed by a 41.3% year-on-year fall in the three months to October 2020. Lockdown restrictions and other measures, such as advice to work from home, led to reduced transport use, with fewer people driving and needing to refuel their vehicles. As 2020 ended, fuel exports were still down 47.5% and imports down 26.5% year-on-year in the three months ending January 2021. \nExports and imports of machinery and transport equipment, which includes cars, vans and office equipment, were both down in the three months ending July 2020 (exports by 29.4% and imports by 27.9%) compared with the same three months of 2019, during the tightest restrictions. The easing of lockdown and subsequent increase in travel over the summer therefore contributed to the increase in exports and imports of machinery and transport equipment. Meanwhile, material manufactures, which include many metals and base materials \u2014 such as non-ferrous metals, iron, steel and goods manufactured using these items \u2014 saw only small falls in UK exports. \n Annual house price rates of change for all dwellings and annual change in GDP (%), UK, January 2006 to December 2020 Source: HM Land Registry, Registers of Scotland, Land and Property Services Northern Ireland, Office for National Statistics \u2013 UK House Price Index and Office for National Statistics - GDP monthly estimateNotes:House price data are not seasonally adjusted.The full UK House Price Index (HPI) release is available to download from HM Land Registry at GOV.UK.This chart uses the output measure of GDP, shown through Gross Value Added (GVA) as defined in the Monthly GDP bulletin.Download this chart  Annual house price rates of change for all dwellings and annual change in GDP (%), UK, January 2006 to December 2020 Image.csv.xls\nThe average UK house price reached a record high of \u00a3252,000 in December 2020 \u2014 an increase of 8.5% over the year. \nAverage house prices increased in 2020 despite the significant fall in gross domestic product (GDP) during the first lockdown. This differed from the 2008 and 2009 economic downturn, where GDP and house prices both fell year on year. \nThis may reflect differences in the cause of each downturn. The 2008 to 2009 economic downturn was because of structural issues with financing mortgages. The fall in house prices in 2008 and 2009 reflects the impacts of the financial crisis on the cost and availability of finance, including for mortgages. Whereas the fall in GDP in 2020 was possibly driven more by reduced opportunities to spend, caused by lockdown restrictions, rather than primarily a lack of funds. \nThe latest house price data, published on GOV.UK by HM Land Registry, may reflect the pent-up demand \u2014 from people who had been unable to buy during the lockdown \u2014 and changes to the types of property people wanted. In the UK House Price Index (HPI) data the average price of detached properties increased by 10.0% in the year to December 2020, compared with a 5.0% rise for flats and maisonettes. \nDuring the first lockdown, analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed one in eight households (12%) in Great Britain had no garden. \nGovernment support schemes may also explain some of the rise in house prices while GDP declined. Stamp Duty was suspended on the first \u00a3500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland from July 2020 until the end of June 2021. In Wales, the threshold for paying the Land Transaction Tax was raised from \u00a3180,000 to \u00a3250,000 until 30 June 2021. In Scotland, the threshold for starting to pay the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax was raised from \u00a3145,000 to \u00a3250,000 until 31 March 2021. Furlough schemes were introduced to limit job losses while mortgage payment holidays and a ban on repossessions have assisted homeowners in managing their mortgage repayments. \n Aggregate balance of expectations, UK, January 2000 to December 2020 Source: European Commission - Eurobarometer Consumer SurveyNotes:A negative balance means respondents expected the measure to decrease either slightly or sharply.

Expectations increased by 30 points (17.8 in March to 47.8 in April), followed by a further rise in May 2020 (49.4). \nThis meant that people\u2019s expectations for unemployment to increase reached the highest level in over eight years. The previous highest was in January 2012 (49.6), which followed the peak of unemployment after the 2008 and 2009 economic downturn. \nPeople's expectations of their financial situation for the next 12 months fell at the fastest rate since records began, down from 1.5 in the month up to March 2020 to negative 9.9 in April 2020, but recovered slightly in May (negative 9.0).

Overall, recorded crime was down 5% in Northern Ireland in the year ending September 2020 compared with the year ending September 2019. \nDespite the overall reduction during the first lockdown, some categories of offence in England and Wales saw an increase. There was a 32% rise in possession of drugs offences recorded in April to June 2020 compared with the same three months of 2019 and a 24% rise in trafficking of drugs. Recorded stalking and harassment offences increased by 20% from around 118,500 in April to June 2019 to around 142,000 in April to June 2020. They continued to rise in the three months to September, with around 163,000 offences, 31% up on around 125,000 recorded in July to September 2019. \nNotable falls included a 74% drop year on year in recorded theft from the person in the three months to June 2020, a 47% drop in robberies and 51% drop in shoplifting. This coincided with the increase in time people spent at home during the lockdown period, reducing the opportunities for theft in public spaces and the closure of the night-time economy.

In some cases, changes to Working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance would have also affected businesses\u2019 ability to remain open in different periods.\nAcross all industries, around 45% of the workforce have been operating from their normal place of work during the early 2021 lockdown, down from 51% during autumn and winter 2020 restrictions but up from 36% in the first national lockdown. \nThis is supported by our previous analysis of behaviours during different lockdown periods, which shows the proportion of people travelling to work is up by around 10 percentage points in the early 2021 lockdown compared with spring 2020. Similarly, road activity observed from traffic camera data in London and the North East of England shows an increase of cars, buses, vans and trucks on the roads in the early 2021 lockdown compared with spring 2020.\nWhile the proportion of people working from home has remained high since spring 2020 in industries such as information and communication, and professional, scientific and technical activities, other sectors less suited to work remotely have adapted to allow their staff to return to their normal place of work. \nFor example, during the spring 2020 lockdown, around a third of construction staff were working on-site as the introduction of restrictions and uncertainty on their implications for the sector saw a temporary suspension of projects and closure of sites. As a result, output in the construction sector (which accounts for 6.4% of GDP) fell by 40% in April 2020 alone, the largest monthly fall on record, with an average of 42% of the construction workforce on furlough in this period. \nUnder the autumn and winter 2020 restrictions and the early 2021 lockdown, building activity has held up much better, helped in part by additional guidance for employers to create a COVID-secure workplace. Official estimates show that the construction industry grew by 0.9% in January 2021 against the backdrop of lockdown restrictions. Around 59% of staff have been working on site and less than 5% have been placed on furlough. \nData download\nDaily total expenditure by sector and UK nationsSeven-day rolling average of adjusted indexed values (100 = day of week average February 2020)Source: Revolut, Office for National Statistics calculationsNotes:Introduction of lockdowns and other restriction polices are expected to differ between the four UK nations.Geographic locations are defined by Revolut cardholder address rather than merchant location.Merchant category codes classify businesses dependent upon primary business categories, which can then be grouped up to higher, mutually exclusive sectoral levels.

Average spending across the UK as a whole fell by 56% in the spring 2020 lockdown compared with pre-pandemic, as opposed to 17% under autumn and winter 2020 restrictions (boosted by seasonal spending) and 28% during the early 2021 lockdown. \nThis is consistent across various categories of spending. Compared with a pre-pandemic baseline, the drops in spending on retail (including clothing and footwear shops), entertainment (pubs, restaurants and social venues) and fuel and transport (covering personal travel spend) were substantial in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021, although less severe than compared with spring 2020. \nThis matches what we have seen in levels of workplace and retail and recreation mobility, which have remained higher in more recent periods of restrictions compared with spring 2020. \nFood and drink (including supermarkets and convenience stores) is the only category where spending has consistently remained above or around its pre-pandemic baseline across the four nations, with only Wales seeing slightly lower levels in the early 2021 lockdown. \nNotably, all nations saw food and drink spending spike amid uncertainty and panic buying in the days leading up to the spring 2020 lockdown. The spikes ahead of latter restrictions were far less significant, as consumers adjusted. \nData download\nAcross the different lockdowns there have been various restrictions on non-essential retail stores, which had an impact on the number of people travelling to access these services. However, much like overall economic activity, the impact of coronavirus restrictions on retail sales has lessened since the spring 2020 lockdown. \nTotal sales values dropped to 6.5% below their pre-pandemic level in January 2021, a far cry from the 23.3% fall in April 2020. \nThis reduced impact is partly down to an acceleration in the long-term shift by consumers towards online shopping. The value of online retail sales has increased markedly, largely offsetting the fall in in-store sales. \nFeedback from online retailers suggests that non-essential store closures have helped boost sales. As a result, the share of online retail sales rose to a record 35.2% in January 2021, up from 19.5% a year earlier in January 2020 and 34.1% in May 2020. \nThe rise of online sales as a percentage of all retail has been consistent across sub-sectors, including food stores, that were able to remain open. With the help of click and collect services, the proportion of online food sales increased from 5.3% in February 2020 to 12.2% in January 2021. \nAnd this could be a culture shift: according to our recent Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), 21% of adults plan to continue doing more of their grocery shopping online once the pandemic is over than did so before, which rises to 33% for people shopping online for other things. \nData download\nFacebook mobility data showing the relative number of journeys between local authorities, UK16 March 2020 to 24 February 2021Notes:Seasonal effects from Christmas are captured during autumn and winter 2020 restrictions.More information about Facebook Data for Good via WorldPop can be found in a blog post by the Data Science Campus.Download this image Facebook mobility data showing the relative number of journeys between local authorities, UK.png (126.5 kB)\nPeople have been making more journeys outside their local area in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021 than they did in spring 2020, according to Facebook data on travel between local authorities.

The pandemic and lockdown measures across the UK in 2020 caused businesses to close temporarily, which contributed to the aggregate redundancy rate increasing to a record high of 14.2 per thousand employees between July and November 2020, based on Labour Force Survey (LFS) data. \nSome groups of people have been more affected by the redundancies than others. For example, the redundancy rate for men (15.5 per thousand) was higher than that for women (12.8 per thousand). Of employees recorded as disabled, as measured by the Government Statistical Service, in the period July to November 2020, 21.1 per thousand were made redundant, compared with 13.0 per thousand of employees who were not disabled. \nWith the closure of non-essential retail and hospitality alongside other restrictions to businesses, 71% of the redundancies in the period July to November 2020 were attributed by LFS respondents to employers cutting staff because of a loss of trade. The remaining proportion were equally attributed to either \u201cemployer closing down\u201d or \u201cother reasons\u201d. Both coronavirus and EU exit-related uncertainties may have caused some employers to reduce staff.\nBetween July and November 2020, the industry with the highest redundancy rate was the administrative and support services industry (35.8 per thousand), followed by the \u201cother services\u201d industry group, which includes arts, entertainment and recreation (30.5 per thousand).
