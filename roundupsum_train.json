during the early months of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, until now not feasible because of death registration delays.\n1,603 suicides occurred between April and July 2020 in England and Wales,

than rates for the same period in the previous three years, however, is statistically similar to the rate in 2016.\nThe lower suicide rate was primarily driven by a decrease for males; the male suicide rate (13.9 deaths per 100,000 males) was statistically significantly lower than rates in the same period between 2017 and 2019, whereas the female rate (4.7 deaths per 100,000 females) showed no statistically significant change with earlier years.\nBetween April and July 2020, age-specific suicide rates in England and Wales statistically significantly decreased for those aged 10 to 24 years and 25 to 44 years, when compared with the same period in 2019\nThese statistics are consistent with other research including real-time suicide surveillance in England and international research studies during the pandemic.\nDeaths caused by suicide in England and Wales are investigated by coroners, resulting in registration delays; while these provisional data for 2020 suicides will be
