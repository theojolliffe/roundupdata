There have been increases in positivity rates in all age groups, except among older teenagers and young adults where rates now appear to be levelling off; however, the highest rates continue to be seen in this group.
There have been increases in positivity rates in all but one region (the North East) in England over the last two weeks; the highest COVID-19 infection rates remain in the North West and Yorkshire and The Humber.
During the most recent week (25 to 31 October 2020), we estimate there were around 8.38 new COVID-19 infections for every 10,000 people per day (95% credible interval: 6.92 to 10.93) in the community population in England, equating to around 45,700 new cases per day (95% credible interval: 37,700 to 59,600); incidence appears to have stabilised at around 50,000 new infections per day.
Positivity rates in Wales have increased in recent weeks, but the rate of increase is less steep compared with previous weeks; during the most recent week (25 to 31 October 2020), we estimate that 27,100 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 12,200 to 50,600), equating to 1 in 110 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 250 to 1 in 60).
Positivity rates in Northern Ireland have increased in recent weeks, but it is too early to say that they have levelled off; during the most recent week (25 to 31 October 2020), we estimate that 24,900 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 13,400 to 42,300), equating to 1 in 75 people (95% credible interval: 1 in 135 to 1 in 45).
During the most recent two weeks of the study (18 to 31 October 2020) we estimate that an average of 47,300 people in Scotland had COVID-19 (95% confidence interval: 33,200 to 65,300); this equates to around 1 in 110 people (95% confidence interval: 1 in 160 to 1 in 80).

Of the deaths registered in Week 43, 978 mentioned “novel coronavirus (COVID-19)”, accounting for 9.1% of all deaths in England and Wales; this is an increase of 308 deaths compared with Week 42 (when there were 670 deaths involving COVID-19, accounting for 6.4% of all deaths). 
Of the 978 deaths that involved COVID-19, 874 had this recorded as the underlying cause of death (89.4%); of the 1,719 deaths that involved Influenza and Pneumonia, 302 had the cause coded as its underlying cause (17.6%).
The number of deaths in hospitals was above the five-year average in Week 43 with 14 more deaths for the first time since Week 20 (614 more); the numbers of deaths in private homes and care homes were also above the five-year average at 959 and 39 more deaths respectively.
In England, the total number of deaths increased from 9,833 (Week 42) to 10,070 (Week 43); the South West was the only English region to have fewer overall deaths than the five-year average.
Overall, there were 913 deaths involving COVID-19 in England in Week 43; the number of deaths involving COVID-19 increased in all of the English regions, with the North West having the largest number (325 deaths).
In Wales, the number of deaths involving COVID-19 increased from 47 deaths (Week 42) to 65 deaths (Week 43), while the total number of deaths in Week 43 was 33 deaths higher than the five-year average. 
Based on a statistical model that allows for the time taken for deaths to be registered, we estimate that the number of deaths actually occurring (rather than registered) in Week 43 in England and Wales was between 9,750 and 12,097.
The number of deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 23 October 2020 (Week 43) was 12,292, which was 1,222 deaths higher than the five-year average and 364 deaths more than Week 42; of the deaths registered in the UK in Week 43, 1,126 deaths involved COVID-19, 365 deaths higher than Week 42.

Median weekly pay for full-time employees was £586 in April 2020, up 0.1% on a year earlier; pay fell in the private sector (negative 0.6%) but not in the public sector (positive 2.4%), following four years of higher pay growth in the private sector; this fall reflects the different job types across each sector and the extent they have been impacted because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Across all jobs, median weekly earnings in April remained unchanged from a year earlier on a nominal basis; when adjusted for inflation, they fell 0.9% in real terms over the year.
The average number of hours paid across all jobs fell by 1.5% from 2019, a much smaller fall than the estimated change in hours actually worked (19%, based on the Labour Force Survey for Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020) where usual hours are not included.
While pay held up for most employees, there are groups of employees who fared less well, most notably younger employees, the lowest-paid part-time employees, and those working in accommodation and food services.
Employees aged 16 to 17 and 18 to 21 years were more impacted than other employees in terms of hours paid for, which fell 5.7% and 3.4% respectively compared with 2019.
In accommodation and food services, paid hours fell by 12% and weekly pay fell by 18.1% compared with 2019.
Younger workers and those working in accommodation and food services are more likely to be furloughed and were also less likely to have their pay topped up by their employer when compared with other furloughed employees.
Median annual pay for full-time employees was £31,461 for the tax year ending 5 April 2020, up 3.6% on the previous year; annual pay estimates are largely unaffected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The analysis in this bulletin is based mainly on weekly pay, which is affected by both hourly rates of pay, and hours worked and paid for (and incidence of being furloughed in 2020); the accompanying Low and high paid jobs bulletin looks in more detail at the distribution of pay based on hourly rates and is of particular use when considering policy around the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage rates.

Redundancies have reached a record high in the most recent period, and total hours worked, while still low, show signs of recovery. The number of people temporarily away from work has fallen since its peak in April and May 2020. There are also fewer people away from work because of the pandemic and receiving no pay.
Vacancies have continued to recover in the latest period but are still below the levels seen before the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Annual growth in employee pay continued to strengthen as more employees returned to work from furlough, but pay growth is still subdued as some workers remain furloughed and employers were paying less in bonuses.
The UK employment rate in the three months to September 2020 was estimated at 75.3%, 0.8 percentage points lower than a year earlier and 0.6 percentage points lower than the previous quarter.
The UK unemployment rate in the three months to September 2020 was estimated at 4.8%, 0.9 percentage points higher than a year earlier and 0.7 percentage points higher than the previous quarter.
In the three months to September 2020, redundancies reached a record high of 314,000; an increase of a record 181,000 on the quarter.
In October 2020, 33,000 fewer people were in payrolled employment when compared with September 2020 and 782,000 fewer people were in payrolled employment when compared with March 2020.
The Claimant Count dropped slightly in October 2020, to 2.6 million; this includes both those working with low income or hours and those who are not working.
There were an estimated 525,000 vacancies in the UK in August to October 2020; this is 278,000 fewer than a year ago and 146,000 more than the previous quarter.
Growth in average total pay (including bonuses) among employees for the three months July to September 2020 increased to 1.3%, and growth in regular pay (excluding bonuses) also increased, to 1.9%.

Disabled people reported more frequently than non-disabled people in September 2020 that the coronavirus pandemic is affecting their well-being because it makes their mental health worse (41% for disabled people and 20% for non-disabled people), they are feeling lonely (45% and 32%), they spend too much time alone (40% and 29%), they feel like a burden on others (24% and 8%), or have no-one to talk to about their worries (24% and 12%).
Worries about the future is amongst the most frequently cited ways well-being has been affected for both disabled (68%) and non-disabled people (64%) in September 2020; however, disabled people were less optimistic about the future than non-disabled people, with 1 in 10 (11%) of disabled people thinking life will never return to normal compared with only 1 in 20 (5%) of non-disabled people.
A larger proportion of disabled people (83%) than non-disabled people (77%) supported “strict” or “very strict” enforcement by police of government rules aimed at combatting the coronavirus such as social distancing; disabled people were less likely to socialise within large groups than non-disabled people; only 5% of disabled people mixed with groups exceeding five (from outside their household), compared with 9% of non-disabled people.

In Week 52, the number of deaths registered was 44.8% above the five-year average (3,566 deaths higher) but this increase should be treated with caution; the five-year average was particularly low in Week 52 as the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, all contained two bank holidays, whereas Week 52 of 2020 only contained one bank holiday so would likely have more deaths registered.
Of the deaths registered in Week 52, 2,912 mentioned ""novel coronavirus (COVID-19)"", accounting for 25.3% of all deaths in England and Wales; in Week 52, deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased compared with Week 51 (by 74 deaths).
Of the 2,912 deaths involving COVID-19, 2,497 had this recorded as the underlying cause of death (85.7%).
Of the 2,578 deaths that involved Influenza and Pneumonia, 270 had this recorded as the underlying cause of death (10.5%).
The number of deaths in all locations (hospitals, care homes, private homes and other locations) was above the five-year average in Week 52.
In England, the total number of deaths decreased from 12,113 (Week 51) to 10,680 (Week 52); all English regions had a higher number of deaths than the five-year average for the seventh week in a row.
In Week 52, the number of deaths involving COVID-19 decreased in five of the nine English regions compared with Week 51, but continued to increase in the North East, East and London.
In Wales, the number of deaths involving COVID-19 increased from 256 deaths (Week 51) to 278 deaths (Week 52) while the total number of deaths in Week 52 was 307 higher than the five-year average.
Based on a statistical model that allows for the time taken for deaths to be registered, we estimate that the number of deaths actually occurring (rather than registered) in Week 52 in England and Wales was between 12,683 and 16,574.
Figures for the number of deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 25 December 2020 are not currently available; deaths up to Week 51 are currently included in Section 6, and UK figures will be updated in next week's bulletin.

According to exactEarth seasonally adjusted shipping data, the seven-day average number of daily cargo ship visits in the UK fell to 77 visits in the week ending 27 December 2020, from 111 visits the week before. It remained at 77 visits in the week ending 3 January 2021.
The seven-day average of all daily ship visits fell to 201 in the week ending 27 December 2020, from 294 in the previous week, then increased slightly to 224 in the week ending 3 January 2021.

According to the Department for Transport (DfT) non-seasonally adjusted road traffic data, on Monday 4 January 2021, the volume of all motor vehicle traffic increased by 19 percentage points compared with the bank holiday Monday of the previous week. However, traffic volumes remain lower than the pre-Christmas levels.
According to traffic camera activity in the week ending 3 January 2021, in Northern Ireland, all categories of road traffic except buses decreased. Counts of cars and vans in Northern Ireland both decreased to 69% of the level seen in the previous week. Counts of pedestrians and cyclists decreased to 61% of the level seen in the previous week. This large weekly decrease can be explained by the recent additional coronavirus restrictions for Northern Ireland put in place on 26 December 2020.
In Manchester, all categories of road transport decreased compared with the previous week. Counts of trucks decreased to 84% of the level seen in the previous week, cars decreased to 87% of the previous week's levels while pedestrians and cyclists decreased to 93%.

Footfall across all retail locations in the UK saw a drop compared with the previous week. There was a decrease of 12 percentage points in shopping centres and a decrease of 9 percentage points in both retail parks and in high streets.
Users should be aware that the percentage changes quoted in this bulletin for the week are based on an average of the percentage change on each of the seven days, and are not weighted by footfall volume on each day. This can result in the percentage change in this bulletin differing from that published by Springboard in other publications.
In the week ending 3 January 2021, footfall in Northern Ireland dropped significantly to 22% of the level seen on the same week last year, a 29-percentage point decrease on the previous week. This large fall can be attributed to the tightened government restrictions that came into effect on 26 December 2020.
In the East Midlands and West Midlands, footfall decreased by 18 percentage points compared with the previous week, and weekly footfall in Scotland fell by 17 percentage points, coinciding with the Scottish Government's introduction of further level four restrictions in mainland Scotland.
In Greater London, overall footfall fell to 29% of the level seen on the same week last year but remained similar to the previous week.
Wales saw a decrease of 2 percentage points in overall footfall from the previous week, to 27% of the level seen in the same week last year as it remained at alert level 4.

According to the latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, in the week ending 3 January 2021, around 44% of adults travelled to work (both exclusively and in combination with working from home). This figure shows a decrease of 13 percentage points from the week ending 20 December 2020.
According to Companies House data, in the week ending Friday 1 January 2021 there were 8,248 company incorporations, down from 9,326 in the previous week. However, this was higher than the amount of company incorporations observed in the first week of 2019 (5,876) and 2020 (7,366).
In the week ending Friday 1 January 2021, there were 2,955 company voluntary dissolution applications, a slight increase from 2,939 in the previous week. The corresponding figures for the first week of 2019 and 2020 were 3,095 and 4,109 respectively.
According to OpenTable on Sunday 3 January 2021, the percentage of seated diners at restaurants from online, phone, and walk-in reservations in the UK decreased to 2% of their level on the same day of the equivalent week of 2020 (Sunday 5 January 2020), the lowest recorded since the end of November 2020. The corresponding figure for restaurants in London was 0%.
There was an overall decrease of 0.5% in basket prices between the week ending 27 December 2020 and week ending 3 January 2021. The main downwards contributors in the latest week were sugar, jam, syrup, chocolate and confectionery with a 3.9% price decrease.
Within this category, chocolate was the main driver behind the overall decrease because some retailers reduced their prices on or just after Christmas for various seasonal chocolate items. Bread and cereals saw a 1.1% price decrease.
Spirits and vegetables, including potatoes and tubers, each saw an increase, by 1.7% and 0.9% respectively. The increase in prices for spirits can be attributed to price increases for gin, whisky and vodka after the pre-Christmas sales.

In Week 6, the number of registered deaths involving COVID-19 decreased in all English regions compared with Week 5, with the South East of England recording the largest decrease of 441 deaths.
In Wales, the total number of registered deaths in Week 6 was 31 higher than the five-year average but within the range of 2015 to 2019 deaths for Week 6; total deaths in Wales have decreased by 143 in Week 6.
In Wales, the number of registered deaths involving COVID-19 decreased from 314 (Week 5) to 216 (Week 6).
We estimate that the number of deaths actually occurring (rather than registered) in Week 6 in England and Wales was between 12,689 and 15,735.
The number of deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 12 February 2021 was 17,136, which was 3,617 higher than the five-year average; of deaths registered in the UK in Week 6, 6,113 deaths involved COVID-19, that is, 1,710 lower than in Week 5.

Since mid-January (13 to 17 January 2021), among adults who left their home in the last seven days, we have seen a continuing gradual increase in certain reasons for this, for example: to take children or young people to or from school, college or nursery (14% this week compared with 5% in mid-January); to meet up with people in a public space (10% this week compared with 5% in mid-January); and to shop for things other than necessities (11% this week compared with 5% in mid-January).
Over half (53%) of working adults reported leaving home for work in the past seven days, compared with just under half (48%) last week; this proportion has been gradually increasing since mid-February (44% in the period 10 to 14 February 2021).
Personal well-being measures of life satisfaction (6.8) and anxiety (3.9) remained the same as the levels reported last week, following previous gradual improvement as 2021 has progressed; the level of happiness (6.9) and feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile (7.3) continued to gradually increase this week, in line with the positive trend seen in recent weeks.
The activities that adults most frequently reported they have been doing more of during the coronavirus pandemic, or would keep doing more often after the end of the pandemic were similar: avoiding crowded places (71% during the pandemic, 38% after the end of the pandemic); video calls with family and friends (57% during the pandemic, 29% after the end of the pandemic); and online shopping for goods other than groceries (54% during the pandemic, 33% after the end of the pandemic).
Positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccines remained high; 94% of adults reported they had now either received a vaccine or would be likely to have a vaccine if offered, similar to last week (93%).
Of adults who said they would be unlikely (either fairly or very unlikely) to have a COVID-19 vaccine if offered, or had decided not to have a vaccine when offered, the most commonly reported reasons why not were: feeling worried about the long-term effects on their health (43%); not thinking it will be safe (31%); wanting to wait to see how well the vaccines work (30%); feeling worried about the side effects (29%); and preferring someone in more need to receive a vaccine first (25%).

Data from our Labour Force Survey (LFS) show the unemployment rate continued to increase, though the increase is smaller than in recent periods, while the employment rate continued to fall. There was an increase for people who are economically inactive, largely driven by people who are inactive because they are students.

68,000 more people were in payrolled employment in February 2021, when compared with January 2021; this is the third consecutive monthly increase.
The UK employment rate, in the three months to January 2021, was estimated at 75.0%, 1.5 percentage points lower than a year earlier and 0.3 percentage points lower than the previous quarter.
The UK unemployment rate, in the three months to January 2021, was estimated at 5.0%, 1.1 percentage points higher than a year earlier and 0.1 percentage points higher than the previous quarter.
The UK economic inactivity rate was estimated at 21.0%, 0.6 percentage points higher than a year earlier and 0.3 percentage points higher than the previous quarter.
The redundancy rate, in the three months to January 2021, was estimated at 11.0 people per thousand employees.
There were an estimated 601,000 vacancies in the UK in December 2020 to February 2021; this is 220,000 fewer than a year ago and the rate of increase in vacancies has slowed strongly in recent months.
Growth in average total pay (including bonuses) among employees for the three months November 2020 to January 2021 increased to 4.8%, and growth in regular pay (excluding bonuses) increased to 4.2%; it is estimated that by removing the compositional effect, the underlying wage growth is around 3% for total pay and around 2.5% for regular pay.

The most commonly reported reasons why not to have the vaccine, from adults who had declined or were unlikely to have the vaccine, were: feeling worried about the long-term effects on their health (41%); feeling worried about the side effects (36%); and wanting to wait to see how well the vaccine works (34%).
The majority of adults reported no difficulties when getting the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, based on both experiences of those who have had the vaccine (92%) and expectations of those yet to be vaccinated (84%); and people experienced less barriers when getting the vaccine than their expectations.

The estimates presented in this analysis relate to self-reported long COVID, as experienced by study participants, rather than clinically diagnosed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 syndrome. There is no universally agreed definition of long COVID, but it covers a broad range of symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain, and difficulty concentrating.
Self-reported long COVID symptoms were adversely affecting the day-to-day activities of 674,000 people in private households in the UK, with 196,000 of these individuals reporting that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been limited a lot.
Of people with self-reported long COVID, 697,000 first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously, and 70,000 first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least one year previously.
Prevalence rates of self-reported long COVID were greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, those living in the most deprived areas, those working in health or social care, and those with a pre-existing, activity-limiting health condition; however, it is not possible to say whether these patterns are because of differences in the risk of coronavirus infection or susceptibility to experiencing long COVID following infection.
These estimates provide a measure of the prevalence of self-reported long COVID across the whole population, and reflect both the risk of being infected with coronavirus and the risk of developing long COVID following infection; to investigate the second of these components, we examined the duration of self-reported symptoms following confirmed infection.
Among a sample of over 20,000 study participants who tested positive for COVID-19 between 26 April 2020 and 6 March 2021, 13.7% continued to experience symptoms for at least 12 weeks. This was eight times higher than in a control group of participants who are unlikely to have had COVID-19, suggesting that the prevalence of ongoing symptoms following coronavirus infection is higher than in the general population.
Of study participants who tested positive for COVID-19, symptom prevalence at 12 weeks post-infection was higher for female participants (14.7%) than male participants (12.7%) and was highest among those aged 25 to 34 years (18.2%).

Datasets are still available, but our analysis is reduced. Content will be included as normal from next week's release (15 April).
This week, we are not able to publish the weekly online price change for a selection of food and drink products because of data processing challenges over the Easter bank holiday. We will resume publication of these data in next week's release, which will also include the missing data from this week.  
In the week to 1 April 2021, the aggregate Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS)-based indicator of debit and credit card purchases increased by 10 percentage points from the previous week to 88% of its February 2020 average. This increase was partly driven by the usual increase in ""staples"" (essential goods such as food and utilities) seen around the turn of the month, as well as a continued increase since early 2021 in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors (Bank of England's CHAPS data).
The percentage of businesses currently trading has increased gradually from 71% in early January 2021 to 75% in late March 2021, according to the final results of Wave 27. This is a similar level to that seen in July 2020, but lower than the 84% seen in mid-December 2020 (Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS)).
Out of the 94% of adults who reported that they had left their home in the last seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for things other than food or medicine remained low at 14% in the week ending 4 April (Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN)).
In the week to 3 April 2021, UK retail footfall increased by 9% compared with the previous week to 51% of its level in the equivalent week of 2019. Footfall was strongest at retail parks, standing at 85% of its level in the equivalent week of 2019 (Springboard).
Total UK online job adverts were at 97% of their February 2020 average level on Thursday 1 April 2021, only a slight increase from Friday 26 March 2021. Across all regions, job adverts either increased or remained broadly unchanged when compared with the previous week, apart from in Scotland, where they fell slightly by 1 percentage point (Adzuna).
On Monday 5 April 2021, the volume of all motor vehicle traffic decreased by 24 percentage points to 60% of the volume seen on the first Monday of February 2020. Note that Monday 5 April 2021 was a bank holiday (Easter Monday) and that a decrease in the volume of road traffic on this day is consistent with previous bank holidays (Department for Transport (DfT)).
Average daily traffic camera activity in London for motorbikes, pedestrians and cyclists, and cars in the week ending 4 April 2021 increased to 123%, 109% and 103% respectively of their average levels seen in the two weeks immediately prior to the March 2020 lockdown. This rise in activity in the latest week coincides with the easing of England restrictions which came into effect on 29 March 2021 and the Easter weekend (Transport for London).
In February 2021, the average sensor counts of vehicles over 11.66m in length (for example, larger lorries and coaches) on the Strategic Roads Network around English ports increased by 5 percentage points to 1% above their February 2020 level. This follows the recent dip seen in January 2021 (Highways England).
In the week to 4 April 2021, the average number of daily ship visits remained unchanged from the previous week at 356, whereas the average number of daily cargo and tanker ship visits decreased by 6% over this period to 101 visits (exactEarth).
There were 15,069 company incorporations in the UK in the week to 2 April 2021, an 11% decrease from the previous week and the lowest level recorded in 2021 to date. The main reason for this lower volume is the impact of the Easter bank holiday, as we are comparing a four-day working week with a five-day working week. Therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting this week's data (Companies House).
There were 5,170 voluntary dissolution applications in the UK in the week to 2 April, a 14% decrease from the previous week and the lowest level seen since the week ending 22 January 2021. As for incorporations, the same caution should be taken when interpreting this week's data for voluntary dissolutions (Companies House).

A larger proportion of disabled people (78%) than non-disabled people (69%), said they were worried (very or somewhat) about the effect that the coronavirus (COVID-19) was having on their life; for disabled people this proportion was lower than in September 2020 (83%).
Disabled people more often indicated coronavirus had affected their life than non-disabled people in ways such as their health (35% for disabled people, compared with 12% for non-disabled people), access to healthcare for non-coronavirus related issues (40% compared with 19%), well-being (65% compared with 50%) and access to groceries, medication and essentials (27% compared with 12%). 
Feeling stressed or anxious, feeling bored and feeling worried about the future were the well-being concerns most frequently cited by both disabled (67%, 62% and 57% respectively) and non-disabled people (54%, 63% and 52% respectively) in February 2021; feeling bored has increasingly been reported by both disabled (43% to 62%) and non-disabled (42% to 63%) people with well-being concern since September 2020. 
Among people who indicated coronavirus affected their well-being, disabled people more frequently than non-disabled people specified that the coronavirus was making their mental health worse (46% for disabled people and 29% for non-disabled people), they are feeling like a burden on others (25% and 10%), they are feeling stressed and anxious (67% and 54%) or they are feeling lonely (49% and 37%). 
Disabled people had on average poorer well-being ratings than non-disabled people across all four well-being measures (life satisfaction, feeling that things done in life are worthwhile, happiness and anxiety).
For both disabled and non-disabled people, life satisfaction and happiness ratings were poorer in February 2021 than in September 2020; compared with a period prior to the coronavirus pandemic (in the year ending June 2019), all well-being ratings of disabled and non-disabled people remained poorer in February 2021.
Disabled people tended to be less optimistic than non-disabled people about life returning to normal in the short term: around a fifth (20%) of disabled people compared with over a quarter (27%) of non-disabled people thought that life will return to normal in less than six months.
Positive sentiment towards the vaccine was high among both disabled and non-disabled people: 94% of both disabled and non-disabled people reported they had now either received at least one dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, were awaiting one, or would be likely (very or fairly likely) to have a vaccine if offered.

Compliance with most measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) remained high, with 89% of adults reporting handwashing when returning home and 97% using a face covering; both proportions unchanged from last week.
More people are leaving home in the last seven days than did in mid-January, for reasons such as: to visit a park or local green space (23%, compared with 14%); to meet up with people in a public place (14%, compared with 5%) and to shop for things other than basic necessities (13%, compared with 5%).
New questions this week showed us that 36% of adults met up with someone outside their household, childcare or support bubble in the last seven days, of which 4% met indoors, 26% met outdoors and 5% met both indoors and outdoors.
Over half (53%) of working adults reported leaving home for work in the past seven days; an increase from the 51% reported last week and a notable increase since mid-February (44% in the period 10 to 14 February 2021).
Personal well-being levels appeared to worsen for most measures including happiness (6.7 this week, 6.9 last week), life satisfaction (6.6 this week, 6.7 last week) and anxiety (4.0 this week, 3.9 last week); levels of feeling worthwhile remained unchanged (7.2).
Positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccine remained high; 95% of adults reported they had now either received a vaccine or would be likely to have a vaccine if offered; 94% last week.
Nearly 7 in 10 (68%) parents in England reported that their secondary school or college-aged child took part in rapid testing; the majority (85%) of which felt very comfortable or comfortable with their child taking part.

Weekly data show a reduction in antibody positivity rates among older individuals in recent weeks, likely because the data do not yet show the impact of second doses of COVID-19 vaccinations; daily modelled antibody estimates by single year of age also show this decline, however, this is followed by an increase in antibody positivity in older age groups over the most recent days, likely reflecting the increase in second doses of vaccinations.
Across all four countries of the UK, there is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies but the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination.

Data from our Labour Force Survey (LFS), for the three months to February 2021, are little changed on the quarter.

The slowing down in the rate of recovery for job vacancies to March 2021 is more evident among smaller companies.
Annual growth in average employee pay continued to strengthen, the growth is driven in part by compositional effects of a fall in the number and proportion of lower-paid employee jobs.

Fears about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines were often linked with how quickly they had been developed; participants perceived this as a sign that the COVID-19 vaccines could not be as safe as other vaccines that had been developed and used over several years.
Some participants did not perceive catching COVID-19 as a significant risk; typically, this was because they were younger and felt they were unlikely to either catch or develop serious symptoms from catching COVID-19, or because they felt they were already taking adequate steps to avoid catching COVID-19.
Those who were unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccine cited barriers including: not being able to find childcare to attend the vaccination appointment; not being able to travel to the vaccination centre; or having existing physical or mental health conditions that prevented them from receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
There was an appetite for more information about COVID-19 vaccines, particularly: side effects; contents; how they had been developed; and differences between, and safety of, the various COVID-19 vaccines.
Some participants accessed information about COVID-19 vaccines from social media or unverified sources as well as, or instead of, mainstream media; this gave them cause for concern, for example, about the contents or side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.

Approximately one-third (32%) of all respondents reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their well-being and mental health, and 29% of respondents reported having lost income because of self-isolation.
The results of this survey show no significant difference in understanding of self-isolation guidance, full adherence to the guidance, and having no contact with non-household members when compared with the results of the previous survey (1 to 10 April 2021), which was carried out before the latest easing of restrictions.

In the week to 3 June 2021, the aggregate CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases increased by 7 percentage points from the previous week, to 102% of its February 2020 average; this was driven by notable weekly increases in all four consumption categories (Bank of England CHAPS data). See Section 4.

In April 2021, a net 24% of 33,500 firms reported an increase in turnover compared with April 2020 (as the first national lockdown came into effect); this was driven by turnover estimates increasing in all major industries (services, production, construction, and agriculture) (HM Revenue and Customs VAT returns). See Section 6.
In the week to 7 June 2021, the seven-day average of UK seated diners was at 147% of its level in the same week of 2019; this is a 15 percentage point increase compared with two weeks ago (week ending 24 May 2021) (OpenTable). See Section 7. 
In the week to 5 June 2021, overall retail footfall in the UK saw a weekly increase of 12% and was at 85% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019; this coincides with the Spring Bank Holiday on 31 May 2021 and is consistent with previous bank holidays (Springboard). See Section 8.
On 4 June 2021, the proportion of UK online job adverts for ""catering and hospitality"" was at 140% of its February 2020 average level, an increase of 83 percentage points since 9 April 2021 just before hospitality restrictions were first eased in the UK (Adzuna). See Section 9.
The volume of motor vehicle traffic on 7 June 2021 was at 99% of the level seen in the first week of February 2020, a slight increase of 2 percentage points from two weeks ago (Department for Transport (DfT)). See Section 10.
There was an average of 411 daily ship visits in the week ending 6 June 2021, an increase of 4% from the previous week (395) but broadly similar to the equivalent week of 2019 (410) (exactEarth). See Section 11.
In the week ending 6 June 2021, average counts of traffic camera activity for cars decreased from the previous week in Manchester, the North East and London by 5%, 4% and 2%, respectively (Transport for Greater Manchester, North East Traffic Cameras, Transport for London). See the accompanying dataset.
There were 12,134 company incorporations in the week to 4 June 2021, a 17% decrease from the previous week (14,535) and 6% lower than the equivalent week in 2019 (12,975) (Companies House). See the accompanying dataset.
There were 4,414 voluntary dissolution applications in the week to 4 June 2021, a 31% decrease from the previous week (6,426) and 16% lower than the equivalent week of 2019 (5,234); the large decrease compared with the previous week is in part attributed to reduced processing activity in the latest week (Companies House). See the accompanying dataset.
The overall price of items in the online food and drink basket decreased by 0.1% in the week ending 6 June 2021, to its lowest aggregate level in eight weeks; the main downwards contribution came from ""sugar, jam, syrup, chocolate and confectionery"", and the main upward contribution came from ""bread and cereals"" (online price collection).

Trends in rough sleeping levels in each country of the UK vary, with recent peaks in either 2017 or 2018.
In 2020, snapshot estimates of rough sleeping levels were lower than previous years, possibly related to policy responses, including providing emergency accommodation during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to people who sleep rough.
Statistics indicate that more people who sleep rough in the UK are men, with an overall population ratio of around six men to one woman.
Because of the challenges in identifying people who sleep rough in data collections, all topic statistics are estimates, providing general insight into the scale and characteristics of this population.

Those who became infected post vaccination were less likely to have symptoms and less likely to have a high viral load compared with individuals who tested positive but have not been vaccinated.
Characteristics linked to an increased risk of positivity post vaccination include individuals aged under 40 years, individuals working in patient-facing healthcare roles and in care homes, larger household size and greater deprivation; there was a trend towards lower positivity rates post-vaccination in rural areas.
Ongoing monitoring of infection post vaccination is essential.
This is the first stage in an analysis to explore positivity following vaccination. We welcome input and dialogue from users on its benefit and how we can continue to explore our data. We will continue to publish here and in academic journals.

The largest contribution to the monthly decline in May 2021 came from food stores where sales volumes fell by 5.7%; anecdotal evidence suggests the easing of hospitality restrictions had had an impact on sales as people returned to eating and drinking at locations such as restaurants and bars.
Non-food stores reported a 2.3% increase in monthly sales volumes in May 2021 with household goods stores (for example, hardware and furniture stores) and “other” non-food stores reporting the largest growth of 9.0% and 7.7% respectively.
The large increase in sales volumes in April, followed by a relatively small fall in May, has resulted in the volume of sales for the three months to May 2021 being 8.3% higher than in the previous three months; there was strong growth in automotive fuel sales and non-food retailers of 19.3% and 17.8% respectively.
The proportion of retail sales conducted online remains substantially higher than before the pandemic, but in May all retail sectors, with the exception of food stores, reported a fall in their proportions of online sales as consumers returned to physical stores; the total proportion of sales online decreased to 28.5% in May 2021, down from 29.8% in April 2021.
In comparison with February 2020, the value of total online retail sales in May 2021 was 58.8% higher, whereas in-store sales were 1.3% lower.
Retail sales volumes in May 2021 were 24.6% higher than in May 2020, which was affected by the first national lockdown when the tightest restrictions were in place; however, these growth rates are distorted by base effects and are not a reliable guide.

The behavioural changes over this period were largely related to changes in government restrictions and adapting to living in a pandemic, even when factoring in whether someone had a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine dose by March 2021; for example, those without a vaccine spent 10 more minutes socialising, while those who received a vaccine spent 7 more minutes socialising.
The main difference in changes in behaviour from 12 months ago between those with or without a vaccine dose were in changes to time spent working, explained by differences in age and occupation.
Among the non-vaccinated (more likely to be younger and employed in jobs outside of healthcare) there was an increase in time spent working, whereas there was little change for people with at least one vaccine dose.
While most home-based activities shifted back closer to patterns seen before the pandemic (such as watching less TV), we spent more time working from home compared with the first lockdown.
Longer hours spent working may explain why non-vaccinated people were sleeping about 35 minutes less than in the first lockdown; in comparison, those who had received a vaccine slept for a similar amount of time but spent more time resting, possibly as they were recovering from their vaccine.
The impact of schools reopening coincided with the time parents spent on childcare decreasing by over 30%, which appeared to free up more time for working; this change particularly applied to those who had not yet received a vaccine, who were more likely to be parents.
The gender gap in unpaid work was smaller than it was before the start of the pandemic but was still substantial; in March 2021, women spent an average of 56 minutes more time per day on unpaid household work than men.

In the year to mid-2020, we estimate that 622,000 people immigrated to the UK while 375,000 emigrated; this makes net international migration 247,000.
In the year to mid-2020, there were around 11% fewer internal moves than in the previous year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on mobility from March 2020.
We estimate the population grew in 294 out of the 374 local authorities of the UK in the year to mid-2020, despite the effects of the pandemic and a slowing of national population growth in this period.

More than 6 in 10 (62%) adults said they met up indoors with someone not in their household in the past seven days, having increased from 55% last week and 20% in the week ending 6 May 2021 before indoor restrictions eased as part of step 3 of the roadmap in England.
Adults meeting up outdoors with someone not in their household in the past seven days decreased slightly from 68% last week to 65%; this was at 20% in the week ending 7 March 2021 before outdoor activity restrictions eased as part of step 1 of the roadmap.
Almost 3 in 10 adults (28% this week, 33% last week) reported they felt it will take more than a year for life to return to normal, with 17% reporting six months or less.
Personal well-being measures remained fairly stable this week compared with last week, with similar levels for happiness (7.1 this week, 7.2 last week), anxiety (3.9 this week, 3.8 last week), while the feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile (7.3) and life satisfaction (7.0) were unchanged from last week.
Positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccine remained high at 96% (same as last week), while 89% of adults said they were either very or fairly likely to have a vaccine booster jab for COVID-19 if offered to them.
Those in older age groups were more likely to accept an offer for a booster jab, with 83% of those aged 16 to 29 years being very or fairly likely to accept a booster jab compared with 98% of those aged 70 years and over.

The estimates presented in this analysis relate to self-reported long COVID, as experienced by study participants who responded to a representative survey, rather than clinically diagnosed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 syndrome in the full population.
Of people with self-reported long COVID, 835,000 (88.4%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously, and 380,000 (40.2%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least one year previously.
Symptoms adversely affected the day-to-day activities of 611,000 people (64.7% of those with self-reported long COVID), with 182,000 (19.3%) reporting that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been ""limited a lot"".
Fatigue was the most common symptom reported as part of individuals' experience of long COVID (528,000 people), followed by shortness of breath (388,000), muscle ache (296,000), and loss of smell (285,000).
As a proportion of the UK population, prevalence of self-reported long COVID was greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, people living in the most deprived areas, those working in health or social care, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability.
