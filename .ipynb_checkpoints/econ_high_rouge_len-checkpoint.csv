Young people and those on the lowest incomes who were furloughed are more likely to have felt the impact of the coronavirus.
Estimates of personal and economic well-being in Great Britain, from March 2020 to December 2020, showed people under 30 years and those with household incomes under £10,000 were around 40% and 60% respectively more likely to be furloughed than the general population.
Young people and those on the lowest incomes were as likely to be impacted in this second phase, during November, as they were in the first lockdown. There was a six-fold increase in those aged under 30 years reporting that they had been furloughed, from 2.1% for the four days to 1 November to 12.3% for the period 4 to 8 November.
Those on the lowest incomes were also more likely to be furloughed over 2020. During 11 to 15 November, when restrictions were tightened in some areas of the country, 17% of people with a household income less than £10,000 reported that they had been furloughed. This compares with 2.7% of people with a household income of more than £40,000 who said they had been furloughed.

Of those who have not been able to work (either because of being on furlough or for another reason), over half (52%) of people in the top income quintile continued to be paid in full, while this was the case for only 28% of those in the lowest income quintile.
People with a job or seeking work were more likely to have decreased income during the pandemic, and particularly the poorest 20%, while others such as retired people out of the labour market were more protected.
Throughout the pandemic, employed parents were almost twice as likely to report a reduction in income than the general employed population, although this gap gradually narrowed throughout 2020 as schools reopened.
Self-employed people were more likely to report reduced working hours and reduced income, even if they had received support from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS).
By December 2020, nearly 9 million people had to borrow more money because of the coronavirus pandemic; the proportion borrowing £1,000 or more also increased from 35% to 45% since June 2020.
Impacts to household spending have been felt differently across groups, with parents less able to afford either a holiday or an unexpected but necessary expense than non-parents; they were also roughly 50% more likely to have difficulty meeting their usual expenses.

Retail sales increased slightly in December 2020 compared with November 2020, with the value of sales increasing 0.4% and the volume of sales (quantity bought) increasing 0.3%.
This reflects a period of eased coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions in early December, following a national lockdown in England in November.
Although tighter restrictions to non-essential retail were introduced later in December, feedback from retailers suggested that Christmas purchases through click and collect and online sales lessened the impact of these measures.

Today for the first time we are launching an experimental faster indicator for estimating UK spending using debit and credit cards.
In the week to 14 January 2021, aggregate Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) debit and credit card purchases were 35% below their February 2020 average, with delayable expenditure seeing further decline from the previous week to 49% below its February 2020 average.
CHAPS data from the Bank of England provide an indicator of UK companies’ transactions made by customers using both physical and online platforms. It includes data on debit and credit card purchases. CHAPS data represent a big step forward in seeing how short-term purchasing habits are changing.
The chart shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors “merchant acquirers” and shows that debit and credit card spending rose sharply over the festive period. CHAPS debit and credit card retail consumer purchases were on average 4% greater in December 2020 than in February 2020. This increase was driven by staples and delayable spending, such as in supermarkets and other retail stores, which typically increase in December.
Spending fell in the week following Christmas, and has remained relatively low for “work-related”, “social” and “delayable” expenditure. This coincided with the extension of Tier 4 restrictions in England on Boxing Day, and the start of national lockdowns in the UK on 5 January 2021.

January’s public sector finance figures reflect the ongoing unprecedented impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the government’s support for individuals and businesses.
UK public sector borrowing in January 2021 was £8.8 billion, the highest January borrowing since monthly records began in 1993.
Borrowing makes up the shortfall between the spending of the government and other public sector organisations and their income, such as tax receipts.
Each January, tax receipts tend to be higher than in other months as self-assessment Income Tax liabilities are due this month. This usually leads to a public sector net surplus in January. However, this month the usual January tax boost could not offset the substantial increase in government spending during the pandemic, making this the first January deficit for 10 years.
Between April 2020 and January 2021, the public sector borrowed £270.6 billion, £222.0 billion more than in the same period a year ago. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated borrowing could reach £393.5 billion by the end of the financial year (March 2021).
The recent substantial increase in UK borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt.
UK public sector net debt increased by £316.4 billion in the first 10ten months of the financial year and currently stands at £2.1 trillion, or 97.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) – a level not seen since the early 1960s.
",https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/january2021,"Public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks, PSNB ex) is estimated to have been £8.8 billion in January 2021, £18.4 billion more than in January 2020, which is both the highest January borrowing since monthly records began in 1993 and the first January deficit for 10 years.
Central government tax receipts are estimated to have been £63.2 billion in January 2021 (on a national accounts basis), £0.8 billion lower than in January 2020, with notable falls in taxes on production such as Value Added Tax (VAT) and Business Rates. 
Self-assessed Income Tax receipts were £16.8 billion in January 2021, £1.4 billion more than in January 2020; in the light of the government’s tax deferral policy, it is advisable to look at combined self-assessed Income Tax receipts across the whole financial year when drawing conclusions from year-on-year comparisons.
Central government bodies are estimated to have spent £81.9 billion on day-to-day activities (current expenditure) in January 2021, £19.7 billion more than in January 2020; this includes £5.1 billion expenditure on coronavirus job support schemes.
Public sector net borrowing (excluding public sector banks, PSNB ex) in the first 10 months of this financial year (April 2020 to January 2021) is estimated to have been £270.6 billion, £222.0 billion more than in the same period last year and the highest public sector borrowing in any April to January period since records began in 1993.

Central government net cash requirement (excluding UK Asset Resolution Ltd and Network Rail) was a surplus of £10.8 billion in January 2021, bringing the current financial year-to-January total to £307.4 billion, nearly double the highest cash requirement in any other April to January period since records began in 1984.
General government net borrowing in the first 10 months of this financial year is estimated to have been around 12.6% of GDP, while general government gross debt stood at around 100.6% of GDP at the end of January 2021; statistics for the general government sector are used for international comparisons and include central and local government only.

Retail sales volumes fell for the first time between April and May 2021 after three consecutive months of growth, with the largest month-on-month declines among food retailers as hospitality reopened.
The 1.4% fall in overall volumes in Great Britain followed sharp rises in retail sales in April, corresponding with the relaxation of retail restrictions.
Food stores and non-store retailers saw falls in total sales volumes in May of 5.7% and 4.2% respectively as both sectors were affected by the easing of restrictions for hospitality and non-essential retail.
Non-food stores continued to report monthly sales volumes growth of 2.3% in May 2021 following growth of 25.6% in April. It signals the continued recovery of one of the sectors most affected by physical store closures during the coronavirus pandemic.
Online spending decreased by 5.7% between April and May, with all sectors, except food stores, reporting monthly falls in their online sales. Feedback from retailers suggested online sales have been affected by the easing of retail restrictions as consumers returned to physical stores.
This resulted in a decline in the proportion of retail spending online values, which fell to 28.5% from 29.8% in April 2021 – the third consecutive monthly fall in the proportion of online spending.
The proportion of spending online in May was still significantly higher than the 19.9% reported in February 2020 before the impact of the pandemic, and total retail sales in May were 9.1% higher than pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels.

The largest contribution to the monthly decline in May 2021 came from food stores where sales volumes fell by 5.7%; anecdotal evidence suggests the easing of hospitality restrictions had had an impact on sales as people returned to eating and drinking at locations such as restaurants and bars.
Non-food stores reported a 2.3% increase in monthly sales volumes in May 2021 with household goods stores (for example, hardware and furniture stores) and “other” non-food stores reporting the largest growth of 9.0% and 7.7% respectively.
The large increase in sales volumes in April, followed by a relatively small fall in May, has resulted in the volume of sales for the three months to May 2021 being 8.3% higher than in the previous three months; there was strong growth in automotive fuel sales and non-food retailers of 19.3% and 17.8% respectively.
The proportion of retail sales conducted online remains substantially higher than before the pandemic, but in May all retail sectors, with the exception of food stores, reported a fall in their proportions of online sales as consumers returned to physical stores; the total proportion of sales online decreased to 28.5% in May 2021, down from 29.8% in April 2021.
In comparison with February 2020, the value of total online retail sales in May 2021 was 58.8% higher, whereas in-store sales were 1.3% lower.
Retail sales volumes in May 2021 were 24.6% higher than in May 2020, which was affected by the first national lockdown when the tightest restrictions were in place; however, these growth rates are distorted by base effects and are not a reliable guide.

Total imports of chemicals increased by 19.5% in February 2021. Where the UK would commonly import more from EU countries in such commodities, in February 2021, increased imports of chemicals were driven by non-EU countries.

Increased exports of goods were largely seen in machinery and transport equipment, and chemicals, to the EU. The 41.8% increase in exports of machinery and transport equipment to the EU was driven by a rise in exports of cars.

The December 2020 public sector finance figures reflect the ongoing unprecedented impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown and the government’s support for individuals and businesses.
UK public sector borrowing in December 2020 was £34.1 billion, the highest December figure since monthly records began in 1993.
Borrowing makes up the shortfall between the spending of the government and other public sector organisations and their income, such as tax receipts.
In December 2020, central government bodies spent £86.2 billion on their day-to-day activities, £26.1 billion more than a year earlier. This increase was in part because of the additional £10.0 billion cost of the job furlough schemes.
Central government tax receipts were £43.6 billion in December 2020, £1.4 billion less than in December 2019, with falls in many taxes affected by the pandemic such as Value Added Tax (VAT) and Business Rates.
Between April and December 2020, the public sector has borrowed £270.8 billion, £212.7 billion more than in the same period a year ago. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated borrowing could reach £393.5 billion by the end of the financial year (March 2021).
The recent substantial increase in UK borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt.

In August 2020, both Eat Out to Help Out (EOHO) and to a lesser extent the Value Added Tax (VAT) cut drove down the price of eating out in restaurants, hotels and cafés. In August 2021, these prices had increased. This means that when making year-on-year comparisons there is a large difference. The result is a high inflation rate. This is known as a base effect. The chart illustrates the extent to which the EOHO scheme impacted the overall inflation rate.
In August 2021, this base effect partly caused the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) to reach 3.0%. This is up from 2.1% in July and is the largest increase ever recorded in the CPIH National Statistic 12-month inflation rate series, which began in January 2006, although this effect is likely to be temporary. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) also rose in the same period, this time to 3.2%. This effect is unlikely to be present after August 2021.
The contribution from restaurants and hotels increased in August 2021. This is the largest contribution that this division has ever made to the CPIH annual rate. Other upward contributions to the CPIH 12-month inflation rate came from transport, with further large upward contributions from restaurants and hotels, housing and household services, and recreation and culture.

Survey data of people aged 16 to 24 years show an estimated 269,000 young people were NEET and looking for and available for work in the period from July to September 2021.
There were also record lows for the number of young men who were NEET and unemployed (163,000) and the number of young people aged 18 to 24 years old in the same category (255,000).
Young people are classed as unemployed when they are looking for and available for work. Those who were either not looking for work or not available for work were classified as ‘economically inactive’.
At the same time as this decrease in ‘NEET and unemployed’, there was a record quarterly increase of 70,000 in the number of young people in the UK who were ‘NEET and economically inactive’, currently estimated to be 421,000.

Global trade in services continues to be subdued by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on travel and global supply chains.
Businesses are also facing some impacts from the change in trading rules following EU exit earlier this year, although it is still too early to reach a conclusion about longer-term impacts on UK trade.

Median weekly pay for full-time employees was £611 in April 2021, up 4.3% on a year earlier. This is the highest rate of growth since 2008.
The rise in pay marks the continuation of a pre-pandemic upward trend, with compositional and base effects likely to be affecting the year-on-year growth rate. In July, we published a blog: How COVID-19 has impacted the Average Weekly Earnings data, which explains the complexities of interpreting earnings data in the current climate.
Pay increased for most workers in 2021, but particularly those that were most affected by the pandemic in 2020, such as younger employees, men and the lowest-paid occupations.
The proportion of low-paid employee jobs (based on hourly pay) fell to 14.2% in 2021, which is the lowest since the series began in 1997.
The gender pay gap was 7.9% in April 2021, continuing the downward trend; it increased from 7.0% in April 2020 but was down from 9.0% in April 2019. The pay gap remains much larger among employees aged 40 years and over than for those aged below 40 years.
Meanwhile, the average number of paid hours increased by 1.5% between 2020 and 2021, after falling by 1.4% between 2019 and 2020. Employees who lost hours in 2020 were the biggest drivers of the increase in 2021, such as those in the accommodation and food industry, those aged 16 to 17 years, and those in elementary occupations.

While it was £24.3 billion less than official expectations (on a like for like basis), FYE March 2021 saw the highest public sector borrowing in any financial year since records began in 1947.
Borrowing makes up the shortfall between spending by the government and other public sector organisations, and their income such as taxes.
Central government tax receipts are estimated to have been £523.6 billion in FYE March 2021, £34.2 billion lower than in FYE March 2020, with notable falls in taxes on production such as Value Added Tax (VAT), Business Rates, and Fuel Duty.
Over the same period, central government bodies are estimated to have spent £941.7 billion on day-to-day activities (referred to as current expenditure) in FYE March 2021, £203.2 billion more than in FYE March 2020. This growth in spending includes the £78.2 billion cost of the coronavirus job support schemes: the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and Self-employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS).
This substantial increase in borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt, which currently stands at 97.7% of gross domestic product (GDP), maintaining a level not seen since the early 1960s.

Annual growth in average employee pay continued to strengthen; the growth is driven in part by compositional effects of a fall in the number and proportion of lower-paid employee jobs, and by increased bonuses, which had been postponed earlier in the year.

The number of job vacancies in November 2020 to January 2021 was 26% lower than a year ago. This is an improvement on the position in summer 2020 when vacancies were down by nearly 60% year on year, but the rate of improvement has slowed in the past few months. Further restrictions and national lockdowns recently have had an impact on vacancies in some industries more than others, most notably the accommodation and food services industry.

The number of full-time employees increased on the quarter; however, this was offset by a decrease in part-time employees. The number of self-employed workers increased slightly in the latest quarter (December 2021 to February 2022) but is still well below pre-coronavirus levels.
The estimated number of payrolled employees shows a small monthly increase (up 35,000 on the revised February 2022 figure) to a record 29.6 million in March 2022.
The unemployment rate for December 2021 to February 2022 decreased by 0.2 percentage points on the quarter to 3.8%.

",https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/uklabourmarketapril2022,"The latest Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for December 2021 to February 2022 show the employment rate is unchanged on the quarter, while the unemployment rate decreased. Over the same period, the economic inactivity rate has increased slightly.
The UK employment rate was largely unchanged on the quarter at 75.5%, but still below pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels. The number of full-time employees increased on the quarter; however this was offset by a decrease in part-time employees. While the number of self-employed workers is still well below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, it has increased slightly in the recent quarter.
Our most timely estimate of payrolled employees for March 2022 shows a small monthly increase (up 35,000 on the revised February 2022) to a record 29.6 million.
The unemployment rate for December 2021 to February 2022 decreased by 0.2 percentage points on the quarter to 3.8%. Those unemployed for up to 12 months decreased during the latest period to a record low. Meanwhile, those unemployed for over 12 months continued to decrease from the peak in July to September 2021.
The economic inactivity rate increased by 0.2 percentage points to 21.4% in December 2021 to February 2022. This increase was driven by those who are economically inactive because they are looking after family or home, retired, or long-term sick.
The number of job vacancies in January to March 2022 rose to a new record of 1,288,000. However, the rate of growth in vacancies continued to slow down. Over the quarter the number of vacancies increased by 50,200 with the largest increase in human health and social work. 
Growth in average total pay (including bonuses) was 5.4% and growth in regular pay (excluding bonuses) was 4.0% in December 2021 to February 2022. In real terms (adjusted for inflation), growth in total pay was 0.4% and regular pay fell on the year at negative 1.0%; strong bonus payments over the past six months have kept recent real total pay growth positive. Previous months' strong growth rates were affected upwards by base and compositional effects. These initial temporary factors have worked their way out. However, we are now comparing the latest period with a period where certain sectors had increasing numbers of employees on furlough because of the winter 2020 to 2021 lockdown. Therefore, a small amount of base effect will be present for these sectors. This will not be to the degree we saw when comparing periods at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
