Within production, mining and quarrying output contracted sharply, by 15.0%, in April 2021 because of planned temporary closures for maintenance of oil field production sites. \\nConstruction output fell by 2.0% in April 2021, following exceptionally strong growth in March.

It is however 553,000 below levels seen before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Since February 2020, the largest falls in payrolled employment have been in the accommodation and food services sector, people aged under 25 years, and people living in London.\\nThese three groups have also seen the largest monthly increases but are still well below pre-pandemic levels.\\nFollowing a period of employment growth and low unemployment since the start of the pandemic, employment had generally been decreasing and unemployment increasing. However, the latest estimates (February to April 2021) continue to show signs of recovery. There was a quarterly increase in the employment rate of 0.2 percentage points to 75.2% and a quarterly decrease in the unemployment rate of 0.3 percentage points to 4.7%.\\xa0The economic inactivity rate was largely unchanged on the previous quarter at 21.0%.\\nWith the relaxation of many coronavirus restrictions, total hours worked increased on the quarter, however it is still below pre-pandemic levels. The redundancy rate decreased on the quarter and is now similar to pre-pandemic levels.\\nThe number of job vacancies in March to May 2021 was 758,000, only 27,000 below the level before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in January to March 2020; most industries have recovered to show vacancies above pre-pandemic levels. The strongest quarterly increase was in accommodation and food services. In May 2021, the experimental monthly vacancies data, and the experimental Adzuna online vacancies data both surpassed pre-pandemic levels.\\nAnnual growth in average employee pay has continued to increase, however this is driven by compositional effects of a fall in the number and proportion of lower-paid employee jobs and because the latest month is now compared with April 2020 when earnings were first affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (the base effect). Growth in average total pay (including bonuses) and regular pay (excluding bonuses) among employees was 5.6% for the three months February to April 2021.\\n'"

      "The service sector grew by 1.9% in March 2021, with schools re-opening across England and Wales and retail trade sales continuing to show strength. However, despite this growth, education output in March 2021 remained 3.9% below its December 2020 level, when schools were last fully open before the latest coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were introduced across the UK.\n",
      "Output in human health and social work activities grew 1.7% in March 2021, following revised growth of 0.7% in February and negative 0.7% in January. This gradual pick up in health in the first three months of 2021 is driven by the NHS Test and Trace service and COVID-19 vaccination across the UK.\n",

      "The construction sector grew by 5.8% in March 2021, driven by growth in both new work and repair and maintenance. The growth in construction (and indeed manufacturing) reflects businesses continuing to adapt, including development of COVID-19 secure environments in which to operate. \n",

      "Central government receipts were estimated to have increased by Â£3.8 billion in April 2021 compared with April 2020, reaching Â£58.0 billion, including Â£42.5 billion in tax receipts. \n",

Of this, Â£5.5 billion reflects the cost of the coronavirus job support schemes (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and Self-employment Income Support Scheme), Â£4.5 billion less than a year earlier. \n",
      "In the financial year ending (FYE) March 2021, the UK public sector borrowed Â£300.3 billion, revised down by Â£2.8 billion from last monthâ€™s first provisional estimate. This remains the highest borrowing since records began in FYE March 1946. \n",
      "Expressed as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP), public sector net borrowing in FYE March 2021 was 14.3%, revised down by 0.2 percentage points from last monthâ€™s first provisional estimate. It remains the highest such ratio since the end of World War Two, when it was 15.2% in FYE March 1946. \n",
      "On a like-for-like basis, borrowing in the FYE March 2021 was Â£27.1 billion less than the official forecast made by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR expects that borrowing could reach Â£233.9 billion in the FYE March 2022. \n",
      "This substantial increase in borrowing has led to a sharp increase in public sector net debt which currently stands at 98.5% of GDP, the highest ratio since the 99.5% that was recorded in March 1962. \n",

      "UK total trade in goods (imports plus exports) with EU countries decreased by 23.1% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2021 compared to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2018. This was because goods exports fell by 24.0% and imports by 22.5%. Total trade in goods with non-EU countries fell by a much smaller 0.8% in the same period. \n",
      "Total goods trade with EU countries reduced by 20.3% between Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020 and Quarter 1 2021. Stockpiling both in the UK and in the EU prior to the end of the EU transition period on 1 January 2021 may have contributed to this. Total goods trade with non-EU countries reduced by a lesser 0.4%. \n",
      "Evidence from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) shows that, of currently trading businesses that have reported challenges at the end of February 2021, many businesses reported that the end of the EU transition period was a challenge in importing and/or exporting in this period, more so than the pandemic. \n",
      "Of the UKâ€™s five largest import partners, only goods imports from China have increased between Quarter 1 2018 and Quarter 1 2021. The 59% growth in imports over this period is in part likely because of Chinaâ€™s exports not being as affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as other countries, and increased demand for electronics and textiles with the latter being caused by increased demand for personal protective equipment (PPE). \n",
