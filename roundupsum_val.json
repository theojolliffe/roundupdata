Our methodology article provides more information on the methods used for our models. In addition, our recent analysis shows that vaccination reduces the risk of testing positive.\n\n!\n\nAnalysis in this bulletin is for a different time period to the headline figures presented in the weekly COVID-19 Infection Survey bulletin. Reference periods are clearly stated at the start of each section, with more detail on what the analysis covers. \n\n\n\nThis section examines the characteristics of people who are more likely to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) during the two weeks up to 3 October 2021. This analysis is an update of previous results presented in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of populations in the UK by risk of testing positive for COVID-19, September 2021, which provides a more detailed explanation of the methods used. An update of data published in the technical article can be found in tables 1a to 3b of the accompanying dataset. \nThe analysis in this section fits two statistical models to predict the likelihood of an individual testing positive for COVID-19 and can be used to identify subgroups where infections are persisting or arising. It is important to note that people can become infected even if they are fully vaccinated, so it is important to monitor infections by characteristics regularly regardless of whether someone has been vaccinated.\nOur technical article also presented the effect of behavioural variables (such as wearing of facemasks and contact with others) on the likelihood of testing positive. We have not included the behavioural model this time, since we are reviewing the model to consider how groups with recent higher infection rates (school children) could affect the results since children\u2019s behaviour is likely to be different from adults.\nAll analysis described in this section covers the two weeks to 3 October 2021. A longer time series covering 5 April to 3 October 2021 for the key demographic variables and all screening characteristics is available in the accompanying dataset. Estimates of the likelihood of some specific characteristics affecting an individual testing positive can fluctuate from one fortnight to another, meaning that findings which were significant in one period may not necessarily be significant in another period. This may be because the effect of a characteristic is genuinely changing or because we do not have sufficient individuals with that characteristic in a particular fortnight to exclude any differences we find being compatible to chance.\nChildren and teenagers, those living in a household of three or more people, and those living in a multigenerational household were all separately more likely to test positive for COVID-19. This is in comparison to those of older ages, those living in single person households, and those not living in a multigenerational household, respectively. The trends seen in age and household size have been consistent over previous weeks, whereas the trend for multigenerational households has fluctuated, with some fortnights showing no statistical evidence of a difference. Females were less likely to test positive than males although evidence of a significant difference has fluctuated over recent fortnights. The relationship between deprivation and positivity differs between people of white and non-white ethnicities. For white individuals, those who live in more deprived areas were more likely to test positive, while the opposite was true for non-white individuals. Those who live in less deprived areas were more likely to test positive. This is a new trend in the data which we will continue to monitor over the coming weeks.\nIn this latest fortnight\u2019s data, those who work in the manufacturing or education sectors were more likely to test positive in comparison to those working in other sectors. This is the first time we have seen statistical evidence of a difference in recent fortnights for the educational sector. In the previous fortnight, findings suggested people working in manufacturing were less likely to test positive, therefore this finding needs to be interpreted with caution until we have more data. Work sectors are self-reported and cover a wide variety of occupations; for example, someone working in the education sector could be a teacher at a primary school or could be a chef at a college.\nThose who lived in a household where someone has had contact with a hospital or care home were less likely to test positive than those who did not. This trend has fluctuated, with some fortnights showing no statistical evidence of a difference. There was no statistical evidence that working in a patient-facing healthcare role affects the likelihood of testing positive, which has been a consistent finding over recent fortnights. Individuals who had travelled abroad in the last 28 days were less likely to test positive than those who had not travelled abroad in the last 28 days. This has been a consistent finding over recent fortnights and may be because a lot of those who travel abroad have, up until recently, been required to self-isolate and take multiple tests before and after flying. This means that those testing positive before a flight would not have travelled, which would potentially reduce the number of people testing positive who travelled abroad in the sample.\nIndividuals who regularly carry out lateral flow tests are more likely to test positive than those who do not, consistent with lateral flow tests being carried out by those who are otherwise at higher risk. As described below, we have changed our approach to modelling the use of lateral flow tests.\nThe models are fitted at the UK level and include all participants aged 2 years and over. Key demographic variables included in the main demographic model are: age, region, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, household size, multi-generational household, and urban/rural classification. Additional variables included in the subsequent models are included only if found to be significant in the two weeks presented in the bulletin. More information on the methods used in this analysis can be found in our technical article, analysis of populations in the UK by risk of testing positive for COVID-19, September 2021.\nWe continually review and update our methods and subsequent models. In the analysis presented in this bulletin, we have changed our approach to modelling the use of Lateral Flow Device (LFD) tests. The \u201cuse of lateral flow test\u201d variable is now not included in Model 2 but is included in a separate model that contains all of the main demographic variables from Model 1 and significant variables from Model 2. This is because work sector is related to LFD use, and we want to estimate the effect of work sector independently of LFD use. \nThis section presents analysis that considers individuals with any strong positive test (including repeated positive tests) that had high viral loads (a cycle threshold (Ct) value less than 30) between 1 December 2020 and 30 September 2021 in the UK. We first present analysis for the whole of the UK split by month, and then for the whole time period split by UK country.\nThe analysis looks at any specific self-reported symptom, including cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste, loss of smell, myalgia, fatigue, sore throat, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, or any symptom compatible with coronavirus (COVID-19). Symptoms are self-reported and were not professionally diagnosed.\nFrom July 2021 onwards, almost all strong positive cases (at least 99%) were compatible with the Delta variant. In June this was 92% and in May 46% of strong positive cases were compatible with the Delta variant. Prior to this, very few positive cases were identified as compatible with the Delta variant. This means that any change from May onwards when compared with previous months may be because the Delta variant has a different symptoms profile to the Alpha variant. However, other changes between May and June may also affect this analysis.\nIn addition, when the percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 is increasing, as it has been recently, the survey is likely to identify more people closer to the start of their infection with higher viral loads (lower Ct values). We have seen that the viral load of strong positive results increased during June and July 2021, as measured by decreases in the average Ct value (see Section 7: Glossary, for more information on Ct values). This will also affect the prevalence of symptoms within these strong positive cases.\nThis analysis is based on all individuals who test positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test (Ct <30) and considers what percentage of these individuals reported symptoms within 35 days of the first positive test.\nIn September 2021, 62% (95% confidence interval: 60% to 64%) of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the UK with a strong positive test reported any specific symptoms1. In August, 59% (95% confidence interval: 57% to 61%) of people testing positive reported symptoms. There is no statistical evidence that the percentage of people reporting symptoms has changed between August and September 2021. The percentage of people reporting symptoms was lower in the period between March and May 2021. During this period, the positivity rate was also lower in comparison to other months, and there was a lower average viral load during this time. This could potentially explain the lower percentage of people reporting symptoms between March and May 2021.\nSymptoms reported were more likely to be \"classic\" symptoms than gastrointestinal or loss of taste or smell only. The prevalence of \u201cclassic\u201d, \u201closs of taste or smell\u201d and any symptoms was generally lower between March and May 2021 compared with other months, where prevalence was higher. This is consistent with lower average viral load between March and May 2020.\nIn the UK, the most commonly reported symptoms have consistently been cough, fatigue and headache. The least commonly reported symptoms have consistently been abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea or vomiting. The prevalence of loss of smell, loss of taste, fever, cough, fatigue, headache, myalgia, diarrhoea, and nausea and vomiting was lower in the period between March and May 2021 when positivity was lower in comparison to other months. However, confidence intervals are wide and overlap with previous months\u2019 estimates.\nData on the percentage of people reporting specific symptoms by month for the UK, and by country for the total time period studied can be found in the accompanying dataset.\nThe percentage of strong positive cases where any symptoms were reported appears to be slightly lower in Northern Ireland, although confidence intervals overlap with other countries. This may be driven by slightly fewer people reporting loss of taste and smell (which is a classic symptom) compared with England, Wales and Scotland. In addition, our sampling method for Northern Ireland is different to the other nations, inviting only people who have previously participated in a Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) survey, which could result in a sample of individuals who are less likely to report symptoms.\nPatterns of the prevalence of specific symptoms are similar for each UK country, and align with data for the whole of the UK.\n\n!\n\nBecause of a smaller number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison to England in our sample, the confidence intervals are wider indicating higher uncertainty. \n\n\n\nThis analysis considers all symptoms reported at survey visits within 35 days of the first positive test of the episode, and at each survey visit we ask about symptoms in the last seven days. This includes symptoms reported even when there is a negative test result within this timeframe or a positive test result with a higher Ct value. The strength of the test is determined by how quickly the virus is detected, measured by a Ct value. The lower the Ct value, the higher the viral load and stronger the positive test. We look at strong positive test results with a Ct of less than 30 to exclude the possibility that symptoms are not identified because we pick up individuals very early or later on in their infection. More details on this analysis can be found in Section 8.\nIndividuals taking part in the survey were asked at each visit whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms1 in the seven days before they were tested, and also separately whether they felt that they had symptoms compatible with a coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in the last seven days.\nThis section looks at how often individuals are reporting social contact (either socially distanced or physical contact) with other people outside their own household, regardless of whether they have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). We asked school-age children (aged 2 years to School Year 11) and adults (School Year 12 and over) how many people aged 17 years and under, 18 to 69 years, and 70 years and over they have had contact with outside their household up to seven days prior to each survey visit. \"Contact\" refers to either of the following:\nsocially distanced contact\nphysical contact, such as a handshake or personal care, including while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)\nWe report on recent trends in this section, but the full time series for this analysis, which covers the period between 11 July 2020 and 2 October 2021 for England, and 19 September 2020 to 2 October 2021 for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, is available in the accompanying dataset. The analysis for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland starts at a later date because data collection started later in these countries. Our estimates have been weighted to be representative of the total population in each of the four UK countries.\nThe trends in socially distanced and physical contacts are very similar for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and are broadly unchanged since our last bulletin.\nAcross all four UK nations, the number of socially distanced and physical contacts that adults and school-age children reported with people of all ages outside their household has been increasing since March 2021, although school age children had fewer contacts during the school holidays. Adults appear to consistently have more socially distanced and physical contacts with those aged 18 to 69 years than with those aged under 18 years or aged 70 years and over. School-age children appear to have had more socially distanced and physical contacts with those aged under 18 years.\nSchool term dates, and COVID-19 related school policies vary by nation and this is reflected in the data. For example, in the 14-day period up to 3 September 2021, there was an increase in school age children reporting contact with those aged under 18 years in Northern Ireland and Scotland. A similar increase was seen in England and Wales in the 14-day period up to 2 October 2021. The differing times of these increases correspond to schools reopening at different times after the summer holidays in Northern Ireland and Scotland compared with England and Wales.\nFurther information on the schedule for school re-openings can be viewed for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Information on lockdown easing can be viewed for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur findings are generally similar to those reported in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), which examines the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain. The most recent OPN bulletin reported that among 3,400 adult respondents in Great Britain, from 22 September to 3 October 2021:\na smaller proportion of adults (40%) reported that they always or often maintained social distancing when outside their home compared with 45% in the previous period, a figure which has steadily decreased since the start of May 2021\njust over half of adults (55%) reported that they avoided physical contact with others outside their home in the past seven days, a reduction of 4 percentage points from the previous period (59%)\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19, UK Dataset | Released 21 October 2021 Characteristics of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.

To account for differences in population size and age structure of the vaccination status groups over time, we calculated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) (Figure 1) using the Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) dataset (see Measuring the data). This is a dataset containing people who reside in England who could be linked to the 2011 Census and the GP Patient Register 2019, which covers approximately 79% of people aged 10 years and over living in England. ASMRs for all-cause deaths and age-specific rates for deaths involving COVID-19 are also included in the accompanying dataset.\nThe vaccination status is split by dose and time since vaccination, to allow for the increase in protection in the first few weeks after vaccination. The vaccination status is one of:\nunvaccinated\nreceived only the first dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived only the first dose, at least 21 days ago\nreceived the second dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived the second dose, at least 21 days ago\nThe ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 and all causes for vaccination status groups over the period 2 January to 24 September 2021 (Week 1 to Week 38) are shown in Table 1. These ASMRs are calculated in person-years at risk to account for the different time people spent in each vaccination state in the period.\nThe ASMRs for total deaths and deaths involving COVID-19 are significantly higher among people who are unvaccinated than people who had received either one or two doses. The ASMR for deaths involving COVID-19 for unvaccinated people is 32 times greater than that of people who had received two doses at least 21 days ago.\n\n!\n\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) can be affected by differing characteristics of the population in the vaccination status groups and the changing COVID-19 infection rate. Therefore, the ASMRs do not show causal links between vaccines and risk of mortality. \n\n\n\nDownload the data\nAs shown in Figure 1, the weekly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for people who had received two vaccination doses are lower than those for people who have received one dose or are unvaccinated in every week of the period. The weekly ASMRs for people who had received only one dose are in general lower than the ASMRs for people who were unvaccinated but higher than those for people who had received two vaccination doses.\nWeekly age-specific mortality rates were calculated for aggregated age groups rather than the usual five-year age groups because of low numbers of deaths in some age groups which could pose a risk of disclosure of the vaccination status of individuals and result in unstable estimates. The age-specific rates are included in the accompanying dataset and can be used to highlight which age groups are driving changes in the age-standardised mortality rates. \n\n!\n\nThe weekly counts of total deaths and deaths involving COVID-19 will not equal those in other Office for National Statistics publications because we use the Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) as the population for the ASMRs. See Glossary. \n\n\n\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) allow for comparison of mortality rates of populations with different age structures, as the population is standardised in five-year age groups to a standard population. Information on how ASMRs are calculated can be found in our Methodology article. Age standardisation is important when comparing mortality rates of different vaccination status groups, as the age structures of the populations differ greatly between the groups and over time.\nWhile the ASMRs provide evidence that vaccinated individuals have a lower risk of dying of coronavirus (COVID-19) than unvaccinated individuals, they cannot be used to determine vaccine effectiveness. This is because the populations in each vaccine status group are likely to differ in ways other than population size and age because of the selective roll out of the vaccination programme and differences in vaccine uptake. Care should be taken in interpreting trends in the ASMRs as these cannot be causally linked to vaccinations. Differences between the groups and over time, such as health status, can have a particularly large effect on the ASMRs, especially when the population becomes unrepresentative of the age group in general. This can happen if people with particular characteristics, such as poor health, remain in a particular vaccination status group.\nFor example, the total mortality rate for the \"21 days or more after first dose\" group increases sharply from approximately week 13 to week 19 (Table 2 of the accompanying dataset). However, looking at\u00a0the percentage of elderly people who are in this vaccination status group (Table 4 of the accompanying dataset), we see that this drops\u00a0to very low levels around\u00a0the same weeks, therefore the mortality rates are based on a very small percentage of the elderly population, which may not be representative of the elderly population in general. For example, this group may include people who did not receive a second vaccination after receiving the first because of being hospitalised for a serious condition. Similar patterns are observed for the \"unvaccinated\" and \"within 21 days of first dose\" groups at earlier times of the year. This effect is much reduced as age decreases.\nTo calculate age-specific mortality rates and age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs), we need to know both the number of deaths and the number of living people in each age group and their vaccination status. There are different approaches to determining the population, which affect the reported mortality rates and ASMRs. If the population is estimated using the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) or people registered with a GP, this can result in an overestimate of the unvaccinated population because of the inclusion of people who have died or moved away. Conversely, using Office for National Statistics (ONS) population estimates and deriving the unvaccinated population as the difference to the number of vaccinated people, could result in underestimating the unvaccinated population if the ONS population estimates are lower than the true value.\nWe used the Public Health Data Asset, a dataset based on the 2011 Census, linked to mortality data and NIMS vaccination data, to obtain both the numerators and denominators for mortality rates. This covers approximately 79% of all people aged 10 years and over and the use of the census linked to GP records means there should be minimal overestimation of the unvaccinated population.\nEstimates of ASMRs by vaccination status are also published by Public Health England. In addition to the use of a different population, these estimates define vaccination status at the date of infection rather than the date of death and therefore are not equivalent to the rates in this bulletin.\nPublished studies have calculated vaccine effectiveness using observational methods, taking into account known differences in characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and confirming the lack of bias because of remaining unobserved differences between the groups. All three vaccines have reported vaccine effectiveness of over 90% against coronavirus (COVID-19) mortality (PDF, 2.29MB).\n\nDeaths by vaccination status, England Dataset | Released 1 November 2021 Weekly age-standardised mortality rates and age-specific rates for deaths involving COVID-19 and all deaths by vaccination status.

In comparison, 96% of all adults self-reported being vaccinated.\n\n!\n\nThe estimates presented here are from a sample of adults, and may differ from the latest official administrative data on the\u00a0number of adults in England who have received a COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\n\nVaccine hesitancy previously reported from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) was highest among young adults. However, when following up with this group, they were more likely to change their attitudes and are now vaccinated (46% of 18 to 29 year olds). This can partially be explained by a higher percentage of this group reporting they were unsure they would have a vaccine if offered, meaning that they were undecided and open to change.\nOlder adults initially reported low vaccine hesitancy, however, when following up, a lower percentage had changed their attitudes and had a vaccine (19% of those 70 years and older).\nIn previous analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in vaccine hesitancy between clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and non-CEV adults. However, on following up, vaccine uptake was lower for CEV adults. Less than 2 in 10 (16%) of CEV previously hesitant adults are now vaccinated, compared with over 4 in 10 (42%) of non-CEV adults.\nThose aged 70 years and over and CEV adults were prioritised in the vaccine rollout, and among those who were previously vaccine hesitant a large proportion had declined the vaccine (62% and 68%, respectively), which suggests they were less likely to change their minds about the vaccine.\nPreviously published analysis showed higher rates of vaccine hesitancy among Black or Black British adults when compared with White adults. Among those that were previously vaccine hesitant, there were similar vaccine attitudes when they first responded to OPN, in that there was no significant difference between these ethnic groups in whether they were unsure, unlikely or had declined a vaccine if offered. This partially explains why when we followed up, there was a similar vaccine uptake between Black or Black British and White adults (47% and 42%, respectively).\nIn previous analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in vaccine hesitancy between disabled and non-disabled adults. However, when we followed up, vaccine uptake was lower for disabled adults. Around one-third (34%) of previously vaccine hesitant disabled adults had been vaccinated compared with almost half (46%) of previously vaccine hesitant non-disabled adults. This suggest that disabled adults were more likely to have deep rooted concerns about a vaccine and, therefore, were less likely to have it. This is also likely as a higher percentage of previously vaccine hesitant disabled adults who remained unvaccinated reported being worried about the effect on an existing health condition.\nThe following groups previously reported lower vaccine hesitancy, and when we followed-up they had higher vaccine uptake. Their rates of vaccination were:\n47% of those who were employed or self-employed compared with 38% for those who were unemployed\n46% of those able to afford an unexpected expense of \u00a3850 compared with 40% of those unable\n52% of those living in the least deprived areas compared with 39% of those living in the\u00a0most deprived (see Glossary for definition of Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintiles)\n50% of those whose highest qualification was a degree or equivalent compared with 26% of those with no qualifications\n44% of those who own their home compared with 37% of those renting\nAll analysis in this section relates to the 44% of previously coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine-hesitant adults who are now vaccinated.\nOf this group, 86% said it was easy or very easy to get their first dose, 9% said it was neither easy nor difficult, and 5% said it was difficult or very difficult. Additionally, 76% did not report difficulties when getting a vaccine (compared with 85% of all adults in England over the period 22 September to 3 October 2021).\nWhen asked whether they had experienced any specific difficulties when getting a vaccine, the most commonly reported was a long wait at the vaccination site (9% compared with 6% of all adults in England over the period 22 September to 3 October 2021).\nPreviously vaccine-hesitant adults who are now vaccinated were presented with a list of motivations for vaccination, covering the themes: motivational and socio-psychological drivers, reasons related to their ability to take part in daily activities, and vaccination incentives. From this list of response options, the majority reported they were motivated to have a first dose for restrictions to ease and life to return to normal (65%), followed by wanting to protect themselves (61%) and\u00a0others (57%) from the coronavirus.\nAll analysis in this section relates to the 55% of previously vaccine-hesitant adults who remained unvaccinated.\nOf this group, when asked about health-related reasons which stopped them from having a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, 58% said they were worried about side effects, followed by long-term effects of the vaccine (54%) or not thinking that the vaccine was safe (32%).\nRegarding trust-related reasons, the two most common reported were thinking the vaccine had been developed too quickly (55%) and wanting to wait to see how well the vaccine works (45%).\nLooking at risk-related reasons, around one-third (34%) said that they did not feel at risk from the coronavirus because of their good health. However, 40% reported \"None of the above\" in response to the list of risk-related reasons for remaining unvaccinated.\u00a0\nThose previously hesitant who remained unvaccinated were also presented with a list of reasons that were potential motivations of vaccination. This group was less likely to report reasons that could motivate them to have a vaccine, compared with the reasons that actually motivated those who are now vaccinated (see Section 4).\nAmong those previously hesitant who remained unvaccinated, wanting to protecting others or themselves from coronavirus would motivate them to have the vaccine (19% for both). However, a high proportion also responded \"None of the above\" to reasons listed within the themes: informational and socio-psychological factors (65%), ability to take part in daily activities (67%) and vaccine incentives (76%). This suggests that what would motivate them to get a vaccine was not included in the survey or this group's concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine are deep-rooted.\nOf the 29% of previously vaccine-hesitant adults who are now fully vaccinated, a higher percentage reported they were very or fairly unlikely to have a COVID-19 vaccine booster (22%) compared with all fully vaccinated adults in England (3%).\nOf previously vaccine-hesitant adults who are fully vaccinated but were unlikely to have a booster jab, 60% did not think it would offer them any extra protection against COVID-19. Around half (47%) thought their first and second doses will provide enough protection, while 46% were worried about long-term effects of the booster on their health. This compares with 35%, 52% and 23% of all adults who are fully vaccinated and unlikely to have a booster vaccine in England, respectively.\nThose previously vaccine-hesitant adults who were very or fairly unlikely, don\u2019t know or prefer not to say to have a vaccine booster jab, were asked what would motivate them to have a vaccine booster. The most common reasons reported were related to ability to take part in daily activities, specifically, easing of restrictions and life returning to normal (34%) and making it easier to go on holiday abroad (30%). However, 44% reported \"None of the above\" for these reasons. A high proportion also responded \u201dNone of the above\u201d to reasons related to informational and socio-psychological factors (55%) and vaccine incentives (63%). This is consistent with the responses\u00a0of previously vaccine-hesitant adults who remain unvaccinated, when asked about their potential motivations to have a vaccine (Section 5).\n\nCoronavirus and vaccine attitudes in England Dataset | Released 9 November 2021 Indicators from the Vaccine Opinions Study to understand changes in uptake and attitudes towards the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, amongst adults in England who previously reported they had declined the vaccine or were unlikely or unsure about having the vaccine if offered.Coronavirus and vaccines supplementary table  Dataset | Released 9 November 2021  Indicators from the Opinions and Lifestyle survey on hesitancy, uptake, boosters and barriers to the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines in England. \n\n\n", "summary": "Over 4 in 10 previously hesitant adults now vaccinated\nA follow-up survey of adults in England who previously reported being hesitant about the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine has shown over 4 in 10 (44%) have now been vaccinated.\nAccording to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, overall vaccine-hesitancy declined from 10% to 3% of all adults between 13 January and 8 August 2021.\nWhile previous analysis showed vaccine-hesitancy was higher among young adults, vaccine uptake was higher among this group when revisited by the Vaccine Opinions Survey.\nAmong previously vaccine-hesitant adults, 46% of those aged 18 to 29 years have now been vaccinated, compared with 19% of those aged 70 years and above.\nWhile vaccine-hesitancy was previously higher among Black and Black British adults compared with White adults, the follow-up survey showed similar vaccine uptake between these two groups (47% and 42% respectively).\nAdults who previously self-reported vaccine-hesitancy are those who declined a vaccine (25%) or were unlikely (33%) or unsure (42%) about having a vaccine if offered.\nAmong these groups, subsequent vaccine uptake was highest among those who were unsure (60%) and lowest among those who initially declined (21%).\nPercentages in the chart above may not sum to 100% as they exclude those who said \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cPrefer not to say\u201d, and those waiting for an appointment.\nLooking at all previously vaccine-hesitant adults, 44% have now been vaccinated, while 55% remain unvaccinated.

It takes between two and three weeks after infection or vaccination for the body to make enough antibodies to fight the infection. Having antibodies can help to prevent individuals from getting the same infection again. Once infected or vaccinated, antibodies remain in the blood at low levels and can decline over time. The length of time antibodies remain at detectable levels in the blood is not fully known.\nCommunity population \u2013 in this instance community population refers to private residential households, and excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings.\nSARS-CoV-2 \u2013 this is the scientific name given to the specific virus that causes COVID-19.\nIt is not yet known how having detectable antibodies, now or at some time in the past, affects the chance of getting COVID-19 again as other parts of the immune system (T cell response) will offer protection. Antibody positivity is defined by a fixed amount of antibodies in the blood. A negative test result will occur if there are no antibodies or if antibody levels are too low to reach this threshold. It is important to draw the distinction between testing positive for antibodies and having immunity.\nFollowing infection or vaccination, antibody levels can vary and sometimes increase but are still below the level identified as \"positive\" in our test, and other tests. This does not mean that a person has no protection against COVID-19, as an immune response does not rely on the presence of antibodies alone. We also do not yet know exactly how much antibodies need to rise to give protection.\u00a0A person's T cell response will provide protection\u00a0but is not detected by blood tests for antibodies.\u00a0A person's immune response is affected by a number of factors, including health conditions and age. Additional information on the link between antibodies and immunity and the\u00a0vaccine programme\u00a0can be found in our\u00a0latest blog.\nThis article presents analysis on past infection and/or vaccination \u2013 which we define as testing positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland based on findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey in the UK. We have also included estimates from our survey on the proportion of people who reported they have received at least one dose of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, as well as those who have been fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.\nWhile the daily official government figures provide the recorded actual numbers of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 issued, our vaccination estimates are likely to be different from the official figures. This is because they are estimates based on a sample survey of reported vaccine status and are provided for context alongside our antibodies estimates. Importantly, our survey collects information from the population living in private households and does not include people living in communal establishments such as care homes, hospitals or prisons. The value of showing our estimates of vaccines alongside our estimates of people testing positive for antibodies is to illustrate the relationship between the two.\nDifferences between official figures and the estimates from this survey differ in scale across each of the four nations (some survey estimates are closer to the official reported figures than others) because of differences in reporting dates and the inclusion of National Immunisation Management System (NIMS)1 data for England. This should be taken into consideration if comparing vaccine estimates across the four nations. In addition, as our analysis develops, our survey-based estimates will enable possible future analysis of people who have received a vaccine with other characteristics collected in the survey. Our recently published blog provides more information on what the Office for National Statistics (ONS) can tell you about the COVID-19 vaccine programme.\nOur\u00a0methodology article\u00a0provides further information around the survey design, how we process data, and how data are analysed. The\u00a0study protocol\u00a0specifies the research for the study. Further information on what the analysis covers is provided at the start of each section.\nThe analysis on antibodies in this article is based on blood test results taken from a randomly selected subsample of individuals aged 16 years and over, which are used to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.\nAntibody estimates are based on a model where England, Wales and Scotland are included together in a spatial-temporal model; Northern Ireland is modelled separately. This reflects the geography of the four countries as Northern Ireland does not share a land border with Great Britain; the geo-spatial model incorporates physical land distance between regions.\nThis modelling approach means we are able to provide weekly estimates while adjusting to make the estimates representative of the population. The data are modelled on standardised Monday to Sunday surveillance weeks and we present data beginning 7 December 2020. Further information on our method to model antibodies can be found in our\u00a0methods article.\nWe also present data on the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who report they have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine since 14 December 2020, and the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who are fully vaccinated since 15 February 2021.\nThe estimates of the percentage of people vaccinated are based on modelling of the people visited in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey in the community. These estimates are then adjusted (post-stratified) using population estimates to be representative (in the same way as for the antibody analysis).\nWe are presenting weekly modelled antibody estimates by country, grouped age, single year of age, sex, and grouped age and sex, for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, as well as by regions in England. In Sections 3, 4, 5 and 7, we report on modelled antibodies estimates for the most recent time period available, which is the week beginning 19 April 20212.Modelled antibody estimates for previous weeks can be found in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nWe are presenting trends in weekly modelled vaccination estimates for adults who reported they have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and adults who report they are fully vaccinated, by country, grouped age, sex, and grouped age and sex for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, as well as by regions in England. In Sections 3, 4, 5 and 7, we report on modelled vaccination estimates for the same week as we report for antibodies estimates, which is the week beginning 19 April 2021. Modelled vaccination estimates for previous weeks can be found in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nThese modelled estimates are produced to provide context alongside our antibodies estimates and do not replace the\u00a0official government figures on vaccines, which are a more precise count of total vaccines issued. While we would expect the overall trend of our estimated number of people who have received vaccines to increase, it is possible that in some weeks, the estimate may remain the same or decrease as a result of sampling variability (for example, we may have a lower number of participants recording a vaccination in the latest week compared with an earlier week).\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

The estimated percentage of adults who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 varied between 23.8% to 35.3% of adults across the UK in the week beginning 19 April 2021. These vaccination estimates for the community population will differ from official figures.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 or who have been vaccinated is low compared with England.

The percentage of adults who have received at least one dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is lowest in the younger age groups but is increasing.\nBased on our estimates, more than 99% of people aged 70 years and over have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine across the UK. Of those who have been fully vaccinated, the highest percentages are found in the oldest age groups and lowest among the younger age groups. The trend in the estimated percentage of adults in the community population who are fully vaccinated varies between the four countries of the UK. This is different to the official figures for the entire UK population.\nWhen antibodies are measured over time by age, it is possible to see the impact of the vaccination programme between first and second doses. In March 2021, antibody positivity decreased among people aged over 80 and has since increased as a result of second doses. A similar decrease is seen in those in their 70s at the end of March and can now be seen among those in their 60s. Additionally, in England, the number of first vaccinations administered was lower in April than in previous months, which may explain why the overall levels of antibody positivity has remained unchanged in recent weeks.\nThe percentage of adults testing positive for antibodies varies by age group between the four nations of the UK. This could be explained by different historical trends in COVID-19 infection rates and the approaches to vaccine distribution in different nations. This survey does not include people who live in care homes, one of the priority groups identified by the\u00a0Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Daily and weekly counts of vaccine doses administered by nation can be seen in the\u00a0Public Heath England (PHE) dashboard.\nModelled antibody estimates and modelled vaccine estimates relate to the adult community population (aged 16 years and over) who live in private households and does not include establishments such as care homes. The true figure among the older age groups in the population may be different. In England, an estimated\u00a090% of people aged 80 years and over live in private households\u00a0and 10% live in other establishments such as care homes.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 or who have been vaccinated is low compared with England. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in estimates for these nations, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nDownload the data\nThe analysis in this section presents modelled daily estimates of antibody positivity by single year of age for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland separately, between 26 February and 22 April 2021. The modelled data in this section are produced using a different method to the weekly modelled estimates presented in Section 5 and so cannot be compared. Each data point represents a modelled estimate of antibody positivity for a particular day.\nFigure 4 shows a decrease in the estimated percentage of adults testing positive for antibodies in the older ages in early to mid March 2021. Antibody positivity has since risen again in the older ages. This is likely to reflect the increase in individuals receiving the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\nDownload the data\n\n!\n\nIt is unclear if decreasing levels of antibodies means that protection is decreasing. Further work to understand this is being undertaken. \n\n\n\nThe analysis in this section presents modelled weekly estimates of antibody positivity and vaccination by sex, and by age and sex for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The modelled data in this section were produced using the same modelling method as in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5. We have provided weekly antibody positivity estimates covering the time period 8 March to 22 April 2021, and vaccination estimates for 15 March to 25 April 2021.\nModelled estimates of antibody positivity and vaccination by sex are presented in Figure 5. Both these and modelled estimates of antibody positivity and vaccination by age and sex are available in the accompanying dataset.\nThe percentage of adults who would have tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample were broadly similar for males and females across all four UK countries, with slightly more females testing positive than males in England, Wales and Scotland.\nThe estimated percentage of adults who reported they have received one or more doses of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and the estimated percentage who reported they are fully vaccinated was higher for females than males between 15 March and 25 April 2021 in England, Wales and Scotland. Vaccination estimates were similar for males and females in Northern Ireland.\nAcross all UK countries, when broken down by age group, the same trends were observed for antibody positivity for males and females, regardless of age. The trend in the estimated percentage of adults who have received one or more doses of a vaccine remained the same in younger age groups, with more females reporting having the vaccine than males, but the percentage was similar for male and females in older age groups. The estimated percentage of adults who reported they are fully vaccinated was higher for females than males in majority of age groups, but estimates were similar in the oldest age groups across all four countries. This is likely to reflect the vaccination programmes across the UK with older ages being prioritised for first and second doses.\nDownload the data\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) antibody data for the UK Dataset | Released 13 May 2021 Antibody data for the UK taken from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.

The number of first vaccinations administered was also lower in April than in previous months.\nIn Wales, an estimated 63.2% of adults would have tested positive for antibodies. In Northern Ireland, 63.5% would have tested positive, and in Scotland 59.2%.\nAcross all four UK countries, there is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for antibodies, although antibodies alone are not a precise measure of immunity acquired from vaccination.\nIn the week beginning 19 April, we estimate between 61.9% and 73.0% of the UK population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with between 23.8% and 35.3% of adults having received both doses.\nAntibody positivity and vaccination are higher in older age groups, reflecting the age prioritisation in the UK\u2019s vaccination programme.\nWe have seen antibody positivity wane briefly in some age groups before the effect of second vaccine doses. In March, antibody positivity decreased among people aged over 80 years, before increasing again as second doses were administered. A similar pattern was seen among those in their 70s at the end of March, and a drop in positivity is now seen among those in their 60s.\n", "id": 443}, {"document": "In May 2021 (Round 5), 0.65% of primary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 0.27% to 1.29%) and 0.05% of secondary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 0.01% to 0.18%) tested positive for current infection for COVID-19.\nFor Round 5 we are unable to report staff current infection to COVID-19 because of the low numbers testing positive.\nFor primary school staff, the seroconversion rate between Round 4 and 5 was 1.4 per 1,000 person weeks; this was significantly lower than the seroconversion rate seen between Round 2 and Round 4.\nSecondary school staff had a seroconversion rate between Round 4 and 5 of 2.1 per 1,000 person weeks; this was not statistically different to the rate seen between Round 2 and Round 4.\nIn Round 5, 24.37% of primary school staff (95% confidence intervals: 19.75% to 29.47%) and 21.79% of secondary school staff (95% confidence intervals: 19.42% to 24.30%) tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies; this difference is not statistically significant.\nBy the end of May 2021, 86.58% of staff had received at least one dose and 43.09% had received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccination.\n43% of primary school parents and 53% of secondary school parents would definitely want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Only 4% of primary school parents and 3% of secondary school parents would definitely not want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n!\n\nData presented are not intended to be generally applicable to all schools in England. The study was originally designed to over-sample schools in areas of England where COVID-19 infection was highest at the start of the academic year (September 2020). Further information can be found in the\u00a0methodology\u00a0article. \n\n\n\n\n!\n\nThe antibody tests used in this study detect antibodies produced following natural infection and not vaccination. \n\n\n\n\nHave you been asked to take part in the study?For more information, please visit the SIS participant\u00a0guidance page.If you have any further questions on the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey (SIS), you can telephone IQVIA helpline on 0800 917 9679 or email\u00a0iqvia.schoolinfectionsurvey@nhs.net. \n\n\nFigure 1 shows the percentage of primary and secondary school pupils testing positive for current coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Round 5 (5 to 21 May 2021). 0.65% of primary school pupils that were present in the school building on the day of testing tested positive (95% confidence interval: 0.27% to 1.29%) compared with 0.05% of secondary school pupils (95% confidence interval: 0.01% to 0.18%).\nThe number of positive test results in Round 5 from primary and secondary school staff is too small to present because of statistical disclosure criteria.\nDespite over-sampling in the North West where the Delta variant was most prevalent in May we found very low numbers of positive cases in the schools.\nMost of our positive cases were compatible with the Alpha variant. In Round 5, 84% of all COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey (SIS) positive cases were compatible with the Alpha variant compared with 96% in Round 4. Suggesting that, at the time of testing, the Delta variant was still concentrated in very specific areas of the country that were not sampled in SIS. \nIn Round 5, tests have been returned for 142 schools, of which 131 (92%) returned no positive cases among participants tested as part of the study and 11 schools returned one or two cases. Of these 11 schools, eight were in the North West (13% of schools tested in this region had at least one positive case compared with 4% of the SIS schools located elsewhere).\nThe percentage of secondary school pupils testing positive for current COVID-19 infection in Round 5 was significantly lower than in the Autumn term of 2020; this can be seen in Figure 2.\nFigure 3 shows the percentage of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Round 5 (5 to 21 May 2021); 24.37% of primary school staff tested positive (95% confidence intervals: 19.75% to 29.47%) compared with 21.79% of secondary school staff (95% confidence intervals: 19.42% to 24.30%).\nThe antibody test used in this study detects antibodies produced following natural infection; antibodies resulting from coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination will not be detected. This is different to the antibody test used in the Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS), which will detect antibodies from vaccination as well as infection, as reported in their latest article. The figures reported in this bulletin are therefore lower than those estimated for the overall household population in the CIS.\nThe percentage of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies continued to increase, for both primary school and secondary school staff between Round 4 and Round 5; this can be seen in Figure 4.\n\n\nFigure 4: Percentage of primary and secondary school staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies\nEngland, 3 to 20 November 2020 (Round 1), 30 November to 11 December 2020 (Round 2), 15 to 31 March 2021 (Round 4) and 5 to 21 May 2021 (Round 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nTo ensure consistent comparisons between rounds, only the 11 local authorities with coverage in Rounds 1, 2, 4 and 5, for at least two primary and two secondary schools in the sample are included in the total figures provided.

Confidence intervals are wide, so all estimates should be interpreted with caution, however, the general trends observed are in line with expectations given infection trends in the wider community.\nIn the case of the coronavirus (COVID-19) antibody; seroconversion is the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results changing from negative to positive and will capture both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections that may have been missed between testing rounds.\nTo account for the different follow-up times between the rounds (on average the follow-up time between Rounds 1 and 2 was three weeks, 15 weeks between Rounds 2 and 4, and eight weeks between Rounds 4 and 5), the seroconversion rate has been calculated and expressed per 1,000 person-weeks. More details on this\u00a0approach are available in the methodology\u00a0note.\nFigure 5 shows the seroconversion rate of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; between Rounds 4 and 5 the seroconversion rate for primary school staff was 1.4 per 1,000 person-weeks (95% confidence intervals: 0.5 to 3.9 per 1,000 person-weeks). This rate is significantly lower than the seroconversion rates seen between Rounds 2 to 4.\nThe secondary school staff had a seroconversion rate between Round 4 and 5 of 2.1 per 1,000 person weeks (95% confidence intervals: 0.9 to 4.8 per 1,000 person-weeks). This was not statistically different to the rates seen between Rounds 1 and 2 or between Rounds 2 and 4.\nStaff vaccination data were obtained by linking to the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS). Details of the data matching can be found in our\u00a0methodology article. Of the staff participating where immunisation status was available, 86.58% had received at least one vaccination dose by the end of May 2021 (95% confidence intervals: 84.28% to 88.65%), and 43.09% had received both doses (95% confidence intervals: 39.96% to 46.27%).\nVaccination data by age and local authority results can be found in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nAs our vaccination rates relate to school staff in 14 local authorities and cannot be generalised to all school staff in England, the data in this bulletin will differ from the\u00a0administrative data on vaccinations\u00a0published weekly by NHS England. The administrative data cover all vaccinations given to individuals who have an NHS number and are currently alive in the resident population.\nBetween 12 April and 21 May 2021, parents were asked to complete a short questionnaire about their views towards their children receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Analysis was carried out on 4,439 responses received from parents with children under the age of 16 years (a response rate of 28%) and has been weighted to be representative of all children under 16 years in the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey (SIS) local authorities (as SIS oversamples local authorities in the North West of England these findings are not necessarily generalisable to England as a whole).\nIn response to the question \"If a COVID-19 vaccine was offered to your child, would you want them to have the vaccine\", 43% of primary school parents and 53% of secondary school parents responded that they \"Yes, definitely\" would want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine. Some 4% of primary school parents and 3% of secondary school parents said they would \"Definitely not\" want their child to have a vaccine, as seen in Figure 6.\nThe most common reasons given by parents who said that they would definitely not want their child to have a vaccine were:\nnot enough research has been carried out\nwanting more information on the long-term side effects\nconcerns about vaccine safety and side effects\n\nMore about coronavirus  Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

The survey cannot report staff infection rates due to the low number of positive cases.\nDespite oversampling in the North West, where the Delta variant was most prevalent in May, the survey found very low numbers of such cases. Over four in five (84%) positive cases were compatible with the Alpha variant compared to 96% in Round 4 (March 2021), suggesting that the Delta variant was still concentrated in specific areas of the country at the time of testing.\nFor primary school staff, the seroconversion rate between Round 4 and 5 (March and May 2021) was 1.4 per 1,000 person weeks, compared with 2.1 per 1,000 in secondary schools during the same period. The rate in primary schools was significantly lower than the rate seen between Round 2 and 4 (December 2020 and March 2021).\nThe seroconversion rate tells us how many people have developed antibodies, capturing both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections that may have been missed between testing rounds. In May, 24.37% of primary school staff and 21.79% of secondary school tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Almost 9 in 10 (86.58%) staff had received at least one dose, and 43.09% had received both doses of COVID-19 vaccination.\n", "id": 495}, {"document": "Average life satisfaction for first year students was 6.6 (out of 10), similar to all students (6.5), but lower than those aged 16 to 29 years in general (6.9), and significantly lower than the adult population of Great Britain (7.1).\nWhen asked about how they felt over the previous two weeks, 37% of first year students showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression and 39% showed signs of likely having some form of anxiety.\nWhen asked if their mental health and well-being had changed since the start of the Autumn term 2021, 43% of first year students reported that it had gotten much or slightly better; this is higher than was observed in a survey of all higher education (HE) students (32%).\nFirst year students indicated a clear preference for any mental health and well-being support to be face-to-face, with 70% reporting they would prefer this and only 13% saying they would prefer a virtual format.\nWhen asked about how prepared they felt for studying at university, 38% of first year students reported that the reduction in face-to-face learning since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic meant they did not feel well prepared.\nThe majority (90%) of first year students said they had already been vaccinated against COVID-19 at least once; with 78% reporting having had two doses and 11% having just one dose.\n\n!\n\nThe statistics presented are experimental statistics, so care needs to be taken when interpreting them.

However, average scores are lower than those for 16 to 29-year-olds as a whole (6.9), and statistically significantly lower than the adult population in Great Britain (7.1).\nWhen asked questions about how they have felt over the last two weeks, 37% of first year students showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression. This is statistically significantly higher than both the general population of those 16- to 29-year-olds\u00a0(22%) and the adult population of Great Britain (16%).\nAdditionally, when asked how anxious they felt in the same time period, responses from 39% of students indicated that some form of anxiety disorder was likely. This again is statistically significantly higher compared with 28% of 16 to 29-year-olds and 16% of the general adult population.\nPlease note that as this survey was conducted early in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, it is likely that this two-week period coincided with at least some of the students moving to or attending university for the first time. This may have contributed to these significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety.\nWhen asked if their mental health and well-being had changed since the start of the Autumn term 2021, 43% of first year students reported that it had gotten much or slightly better. This is higher than was observed in a survey of all higher education (HE) students (32%). In contrast, 23% said that their mental health or well-being was slightly or much worse now since starting, which is similar to what was reported by all students (26%).\nFor more information about how indicators of depression and anxiety were determined, read Section 8: Mental health and well-being measurements.\nStudents were also asked questions from the Sick, Control, One, Fat, Food (SCOFF) questionnaire to assess possible presence of an eating disorder. Overall, responses from 23% of first year students suggested possible issues with food or body image. Responses from 27% of students suggested that they may have an eating disorder.\nFor more information about how indicators of depression and anxiety were determined, read Section 8: Mental health and well-being measurements.\nOver a fifth (21%) of first year students reported that they had engaged with mental health and well-being services since September 2020. The most frequently used services were general practice (GP) or primary care (47%), private counsellor or mental health service provider (30%), and the National Health Service (NHS) or Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme (28%).\nWhen asked what services they would use if they required mental health and well-being services in the future, 16% of students reported they would go to a GP or primary care service, while 17% would use an on-campus university healthcare service.\nStudents indicated a clear preference for any mental health and well-being support to be face-to-face, with 70% of students reporting they would prefer this, and only 13% saying they would prefer a virtual format.\nAlmost half (46%) of first year students reported that their academic performance had been significantly or majorly affected since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19)\u00a0pandemic. This is lower than the general student population (53%).\nWhen asked about how prepared they felt for studying at university, 38% of students reported that the reduction in face-to-face learning since the start of the coronavirus pandemic meant that they did not feel well prepared. In contrast, 18% of students did not feel affected and 14% reported feeling well prepared.\nThe majority (53%) of students said that they would prefer a blended learning format in the future, with a mix of face-to-face and virtual lectures or seminars.

For context, we include estimates from our survey on the percentage of people who reported they have received at least one or more doses of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, as well as those who report having received two or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine (including booster doses).\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the following:\nWe measure the presence of antibodies in people who live in private households to understand who has had coronavirus in the past, and the impact of vaccinations. It takes between two and three weeks after infection or vaccination for the body to make enough antibodies to fight the infection. Antibodies can help prevent individuals from getting the same infection again. If they do get infected, people with antibodies are less likely to have severe symptoms. Once infected or vaccinated, antibodies remain in the blood at low levels and can decline over time. The length of time antibodies remain at detectable levels in the blood is not fully known.\nThis is the scientific name given to the specific virus that causes COVID-19.\nThe analysis on antibodies in this bulletin is based on blood test results taken from a randomly selected subsample of individuals aged 16 years and over, who live in private households. The survey excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. The blood samples are used to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We also present data on the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who report they have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine since 14 December 2020, and the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who report they have received two or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine since 15 February 2021. The data include any reported booster or third jabs.\nOur antibodies and vaccination estimates are based on modelling of the people visited in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. Further information on our method to model antibodies and vaccinations can be found in\u00a0our methods article.\nWe produce weekly modelled estimates using standard calendar weeks starting Monday. To provide the most timely and accurate estimates possible for antibody positivity, the model will include data for the first four to seven days of the most recent week available, depending on the availability of test results. The antibody and vaccination estimates for the most recent week in this publication includes data from 27 September to 3 October 2021.\nAntibodies data\u00a0are currently\u00a0unavailable\u00a0for the period from\u00a026 August 2021 to 15 September 2021 because of a temporary issue in the laboratory testing process. We are working with our laboratories to resolve this issue and will receive data to cover this period\u00a0in the coming weeks.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor this week's analysis,\u00a0we have used a model which includes adjustments for the period of unavailable antibody\u00a0data.\u00a0The antibody\u00a0positivity estimates in the surveillance weeks\u00a0from\u00a016\u00a0August\u00a02021\u00a0to 26 September 2021 are modelled using\u00a0fewer data points meaning there is greater uncertainty for the estimates over this period. These results may be subject to revision\u00a0when\u00a0we receive\u00a0the\u00a0data\u00a0that covers the\u00a0period of\u00a0unavailable\u00a0antibody\u00a0data.\u00a0\nWe present weekly modelled antibody estimates for adults by country, and grouped age for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, as well as by regions in England. Single year of age analysis has not been updated in this week's publication.\u00a0We also include estimates of adults who reported they have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and of adults who reported they have received two or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine (including booster doses).\nThere is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies but the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination.\nModelled vaccine estimates are produced to provide context alongside our antibodies estimates and do not replace the\u00a0official government figures on vaccinations, which are a more precise count of total vaccines issued. While we would expect the overall trend of our estimated number of people who have received vaccines to increase, it is possible that in some weeks, the estimate may remain the same or decrease as a result of sampling variability (for example, we may have a lower number of participants recording a vaccination in the latest week compared with an earlier week).\nNational Immunisation Management System (NIMS) administrative data is used to validate CIS self-reported records of vaccination for England. The equivalent of this is currently not included for other countries, meaning the estimates for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are produced just from CIS self-reported records of vaccination.\nOur vaccination estimates are explained in more detail in Section 10: Measuring the data.\nAntibody positivity is defined by having a fixed concentration of antibodies in the blood. A negative test result occurs if there are no antibodies or if antibody levels are too low to reach a threshold at the time of testing. The threshold we use is 42ng/ml. This is the threshold that the test is CE marked against providing 99% sensitivity and specificity for coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Following infection or vaccination, antibody levels can vary and sometimes increase but may still be below the level identified as positive in our test and other tests, and so give a negative result.\nMost people who are vaccinated will retain a higher antibody level than before vaccination even after dropping below the standard threshold value. A negative result does not mean that the antibody level is at zero, nor that a person has no protection against COVID-19, as an immune response does not rely on the presence of antibodies alone.\nThere are other parts of the immune system which will offer protection, for example a person's T cell response. This will not be detected by blood tests for antibodies.\u00a0A person's immune response\u00a0is affected by a number of factors, including health conditions and age.\nEqually, antibody levels are expected to decrease over time irrespective of vaccination or natural infection, especially when exposure to the virus is reduced. This is because our bodies stop making antibodies when they are not needed.\nOur\u00a0blog on antibodies and immunity gives further information on the link between antibodies and immunity and the vaccine programme. Our\u00a0blogs on vaccine effectiveness provides information on the effectiveness of vaccinations against Alpha and Delta variants, which is based upon the research conducted by partners from the University of Oxford.\nOur\u00a0methodology article\u00a0provides further information around the survey design, how we process data, and how data are analysed. The\u00a0study protocol\u00a0specifies the research for the study. The\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information\u00a0details the strength and limitations of the data.\nThe percentage of adults who would have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies remained high across the UK in recent weeks up to the week beginning 27 September 2021.\nIn the week beginning 27 September 2021, our estimates suggest the percentage of adults who reported they had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine remained high, ranging from 93.8% to 95.2% of adults across the UK. The estimated percentage of adults in the UK who had received two or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine also remained high or continued to increase, ranging from 82.0% to 88.8% of adults across the UK in the week beginning 27 September 2021. These vaccination estimates will differ from official figures as explained in Section 1.\n.XLSX\nThe estimated percentage of adults who have received at least one coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, remained at a high level across all regions of England in the week beginning 27 September 2021. Regional data can be found in our\u00a0accompanying dataset.\nOur survey shows that in the week beginning 27 September 2021, the percentage of adults testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies remained high. It has increased in younger adults and is showing signs of a slow decline in older adults. \u00a0\nMany of the participants who have tested negative for antibodies in the most recent week, received their vaccinations in the early stages of the vaccination programme. Along with age, the early stages of the vaccination programme prioritised individuals on a range of factors (such as long-term health conditions and type of employment) and this may help to explain the declining trend appearing in different age groups now.\nAcross all four UK countries, antibody positivity remains high in older age groups (those aged 65 years and over) but has been declining in these age groups since the end of July 2021. It is important to note that antibody positivity is defined by a fixed concentration of antibodies in the blood. Most people who are vaccinated will retain higher antibody levels than before vaccination but may have a lower number of antibodies than this threshold at the time of testing. This does not mean that these people have no protection against new infection. More information on\u00a0antibodies and immunity\u00a0can be found in our blog and in Section 2 of this bulletin.\nWe estimate that the antibody positivity for those aged 16 to 24 years increased steadily across all four UK countries, with estimates ranging between 95.4% and 95.8% across the UK, for the week beginning 27 September 2021.\nThe percentage of adults who reported they have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine is lowest in the younger age groups but is increasing.\nAcross the four UK countries, the estimated percentage of adults aged 16 to 24 years who have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 79.1% to 82.8%; this has increased sharply since the end of June. These estimates of vaccination are based on reported vaccination status in our survey and are likely to be different from the\u00a0official figures\u00a0for the UK.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 or who have been vaccinated is low compared with England. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in estimates for these nations when our analysis splits the sample into smaller groups (for example, age groups) as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nModelled antibody estimates and modelled vaccine estimates relate to the adult population (aged 16 years and over) who live in private households. The true figure among the older age groups in the population may be different. In England, an estimated\u00a090% of people aged 80 years and over live in private households\u00a0and 10% live in other communal establishments such as care homes.\n.XLSX\nAntibody and vaccination data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey was analysed in a research paper produced by our partners at Oxford University and\u00a0published as preprint\u00a0on 16 September 2021. The paper looks at how much antibodies change over time and how this varies between the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, by key characteristics. We summarise some of the relevant findings.\nOn average, antibody levels are initially higher and decline more slowly in people who have received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine compared with those who have received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In people who had received the Pfizer vaccine, the speed of decline in antibodies was faster in:\nmen\nolder people\nthose reporting white ethnicity\nthose with long-term health conditions\nPeople with a greater length of time between receiving their first and second AstraZeneca dose experienced a slightly higher peak in antibodies compared with those who had a shorter time between doses (considering gaps between 7 to 13 weeks). For people with a greater length of time between receiving their first and second Pfizer vaccine, the peak level of antibodies was slightly lower compared with those who had a shorter gap between doses. Those aged over 70 years had a much faster decline if they had received their second vaccination only three weeks after their first.\nWith both vaccines, prior infection significantly increased the peak in antibody levels after the second dose and slowed the decline in antibodies.\nAfter second doses of both vaccines, the peak level of antibodies was also higher in:\nwomen\npeople in patient-facing healthcare roles\npeople without long-term health conditions\nFurther detail and comparisons are available in\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibody responses after second dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 in the UK general population.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) antibody and vaccination data, UK Dataset | Released 27 October 2021 Antibody and vaccination data by UK country and regions in England from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey.

Positivity has increased in younger adults and is showing signs of a slow decline in older adults.\nAntibody positivity has been declining in older age groups since late July 2021. Many people in this group received their first vaccination early in the vaccination programme. Those aged 50 years and over, at-risk adults, and health and social care workers are currently being offered booster jabs.\nOur analysis defines antibody positivity by a fixed amount of antibodies in the blood. Most older people who are vaccinated will retain higher antibody levels than prior to vaccination, but may have a lower number of antibodies in the blood at the time of testing. Please read our Antibodies and Immunity blog for more information.\nThe survey does not include people who live in care homes.\nAntibodies data are currently unavailable for the period from 26 August 2021 to 15 September 2021 because of a temporary issue in the laboratory testing process. The antibody positivity estimates in the surveillance weeks from 16 August 2021 to 26 September 2021 are modelled using fewer data points meaning there is greater uncertainty for the estimates over this period.

In addition, it aims to examine the impact of attendance of pupils and staff, school implementation measures and outbreak investigations. \nThe long-term aims of this study are to investigate the role of schools in COVID-19 transmission and explore how transmission within and from school settings can be minimised. This exploration of transmission will not be possible until there are one or more tests to compare over time. This bulletin provides the baseline on which the transmission analysis will be developed over the subsequent round of the survey.\nTo facilitate this research, the study aims to:\nconduct repeated surveys and testing every half term in up to 50 primary schools and 100 secondary schools across 15 local education authorities\ncollect risk factor information together with virus and antibody samples in a cohort of children and staff\nThe study oversampled schools in high prevalence areas of the country.

These differences are not statistically significant. \nEstimates of the positivity rate for pupils and staff are presented in Figure 1.\nFor pupils, the percentage of primary school pupils testing positive for current infection was 0.89% (95% confidence interval: 0.54% to 1.39%). The percentage of secondary school pupils testing positive for current infection was 1.48% (95% confidence interval: 1.10% to 1.98%); 19 out of 2,136 primary pupils and 46 out of 3,099 secondary pupils tested positive.\nFor school staff, the percentage of primary school staff testing positive for current infection was 0.75% (95% confidence interval: 0.32% to 1.47%). The percentage of secondary school staff testing positive for current infection was 1.47% (95% confidence interval: 1.08% to 1.97%); 8 out of 1,068 primary staff and 45 out of 3,054 secondary staff tested positive.\nThe 95% confidence intervals indicate that these differences between pupils and staff and primary and secondary schools are not statistically significant.\nThe percentage testing positive for current infection in high and low prevalence areas is shown in Figure 2. Staff and pupils have similar percentages testing positive when comparing within school type (that is, primary pupils and primary staff) within the same area prevalence classification. \nIn secondary schools in high prevalence areas, 1.73% of pupils (95% confidence interval: 1.18% to 2.43%) and 1.62% of staff (95% confidence interval: 1.12% to 2.27%) tested positive for current infection (32 out of 1,853 pupils and 33 out of 2,035 staff).\nFor secondary schools in low prevalence areas, the percentage testing positive was 1.12% for pupils (95% confidence interval: 0.62% to 1.88%) and 1.18% for staff (95% confidence interval: 0.61% to 2.05%); 14 out of 1,246 pupils and 12 out of 1,019 staff.\nIn the first round of testing, 105 schools (63 secondary (60%) and 42 primary (40%) in 14 local authorities participated. Of the 14 local authorities, 9 (64.2%) were in high prevalence and 5 (35.8%) were in low prevalence areas. Within these schools, 11,194 participants (4,941 (44.1%) staff and 6,253 (55.9%) pupils) had enrolled by the test date. \nOf those tested for current infection in 105 schools, 47 schools (44.76%) had no current infections, 29 (27.62%) had 1 current infection and 29 (27.62%) had between 2 and 5 current infections.\nAt the time of this bulletin, almost half of schools enrolled in the first testing round (just under 50) had returned the questionnaire providing data on the infection control implementation measures in place. Therefore, the findings presented here, on implemented control measures, should be seen as indicative only. Future publications will examine the implemented infection control measures in more detail and explore the impact it has on current coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. \nThese initial results suggest that the number of infection control measures implemented varied across schools. Responses have been presented in our dataset, grouped by frequency of implementation. \nThe most implemented measures across primary and secondary schools include hand sanitizers, frequent hand washing and increased cleaning of frequently touched surfaces. The least implemented measure across primary and secondary schools is the wearing of masks or face coverings by students in the classroom.\nThis bulletin will be followed with more detailed analysis in subsequent publications, which will also incorporate data from further rounds of testing and antibody test results. This will help to explain more of the variability in schools and identify factors associated with high or low levels of infection by including variables related to individuals, such as age, sex and ethnicity.\nThis is one of a suite of surveillance studies, which are being conducted to understand how many people have the coronavirus (COVID-19), and how the virus spreads in non-household populations.
