Our methodology article provides more information on the methods used for our models. In addition, our recent analysis shows that vaccination reduces the risk of testing positive.\n\n!\n\nAnalysis in this bulletin is for a different time period to the headline figures presented in the weekly COVID-19 Infection Survey bulletin. Reference periods are clearly stated at the start of each section, with more detail on what the analysis covers. \n\n\n\nThis section examines the characteristics of people who are more likely to test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) during the two weeks up to 3 October 2021. This analysis is an update of previous results presented in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey technical article: analysis of populations in the UK by risk of testing positive for COVID-19, September 2021, which provides a more detailed explanation of the methods used. An update of data published in the technical article can be found in tables 1a to 3b of the accompanying dataset. \nThe analysis in this section fits two statistical models to predict the likelihood of an individual testing positive for COVID-19 and can be used to identify subgroups where infections are persisting or arising. It is important to note that people can become infected even if they are fully vaccinated, so it is important to monitor infections by characteristics regularly regardless of whether someone has been vaccinated.\nOur technical article also presented the effect of behavioural variables (such as wearing of facemasks and contact with others) on the likelihood of testing positive. We have not included the behavioural model this time, since we are reviewing the model to consider how groups with recent higher infection rates (school children) could affect the results since children\u2019s behaviour is likely to be different from adults.\nAll analysis described in this section covers the two weeks to 3 October 2021. A longer time series covering 5 April to 3 October 2021 for the key demographic variables and all screening characteristics is available in the accompanying dataset. Estimates of the likelihood of some specific characteristics affecting an individual testing positive can fluctuate from one fortnight to another, meaning that findings which were significant in one period may not necessarily be significant in another period. This may be because the effect of a characteristic is genuinely changing or because we do not have sufficient individuals with that characteristic in a particular fortnight to exclude any differences we find being compatible to chance.\nChildren and teenagers, those living in a household of three or more people, and those living in a multigenerational household were all separately more likely to test positive for COVID-19. This is in comparison to those of older ages, those living in single person households, and those not living in a multigenerational household, respectively. The trends seen in age and household size have been consistent over previous weeks, whereas the trend for multigenerational households has fluctuated, with some fortnights showing no statistical evidence of a difference. Females were less likely to test positive than males although evidence of a significant difference has fluctuated over recent fortnights. The relationship between deprivation and positivity differs between people of white and non-white ethnicities. For white individuals, those who live in more deprived areas were more likely to test positive, while the opposite was true for non-white individuals. Those who live in less deprived areas were more likely to test positive. This is a new trend in the data which we will continue to monitor over the coming weeks.\nIn this latest fortnight\u2019s data, those who work in the manufacturing or education sectors were more likely to test positive in comparison to those working in other sectors. This is the first time we have seen statistical evidence of a difference in recent fortnights for the educational sector. In the previous fortnight, findings suggested people working in manufacturing were less likely to test positive, therefore this finding needs to be interpreted with caution until we have more data. Work sectors are self-reported and cover a wide variety of occupations; for example, someone working in the education sector could be a teacher at a primary school or could be a chef at a college.\nThose who lived in a household where someone has had contact with a hospital or care home were less likely to test positive than those who did not. This trend has fluctuated, with some fortnights showing no statistical evidence of a difference. There was no statistical evidence that working in a patient-facing healthcare role affects the likelihood of testing positive, which has been a consistent finding over recent fortnights. Individuals who had travelled abroad in the last 28 days were less likely to test positive than those who had not travelled abroad in the last 28 days. This has been a consistent finding over recent fortnights and may be because a lot of those who travel abroad have, up until recently, been required to self-isolate and take multiple tests before and after flying. This means that those testing positive before a flight would not have travelled, which would potentially reduce the number of people testing positive who travelled abroad in the sample.\nIndividuals who regularly carry out lateral flow tests are more likely to test positive than those who do not, consistent with lateral flow tests being carried out by those who are otherwise at higher risk. As described below, we have changed our approach to modelling the use of lateral flow tests.\nThe models are fitted at the UK level and include all participants aged 2 years and over. Key demographic variables included in the main demographic model are: age, region, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, household size, multi-generational household, and urban/rural classification. Additional variables included in the subsequent models are included only if found to be significant in the two weeks presented in the bulletin. More information on the methods used in this analysis can be found in our technical article, analysis of populations in the UK by risk of testing positive for COVID-19, September 2021.\nWe continually review and update our methods and subsequent models. In the analysis presented in this bulletin, we have changed our approach to modelling the use of Lateral Flow Device (LFD) tests. The \u201cuse of lateral flow test\u201d variable is now not included in Model 2 but is included in a separate model that contains all of the main demographic variables from Model 1 and significant variables from Model 2. This is because work sector is related to LFD use, and we want to estimate the effect of work sector independently of LFD use. \nThis section presents analysis that considers individuals with any strong positive test (including repeated positive tests) that had high viral loads (a cycle threshold (Ct) value less than 30) between 1 December 2020 and 30 September 2021 in the UK. We first present analysis for the whole of the UK split by month, and then for the whole time period split by UK country.\nThe analysis looks at any specific self-reported symptom, including cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste, loss of smell, myalgia, fatigue, sore throat, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, or any symptom compatible with coronavirus (COVID-19). Symptoms are self-reported and were not professionally diagnosed.\nFrom July 2021 onwards, almost all strong positive cases (at least 99%) were compatible with the Delta variant. In June this was 92% and in May 46% of strong positive cases were compatible with the Delta variant. Prior to this, very few positive cases were identified as compatible with the Delta variant. This means that any change from May onwards when compared with previous months may be because the Delta variant has a different symptoms profile to the Alpha variant. However, other changes between May and June may also affect this analysis.\nIn addition, when the percentage of the population testing positive for COVID-19 is increasing, as it has been recently, the survey is likely to identify more people closer to the start of their infection with higher viral loads (lower Ct values). We have seen that the viral load of strong positive results increased during June and July 2021, as measured by decreases in the average Ct value (see Section 7: Glossary, for more information on Ct values). This will also affect the prevalence of symptoms within these strong positive cases.\nThis analysis is based on all individuals who test positive for COVID-19 with a strong positive test (Ct <30) and considers what percentage of these individuals reported symptoms within 35 days of the first positive test.\nIn September 2021, 62% (95% confidence interval: 60% to 64%) of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the UK with a strong positive test reported any specific symptoms1. In August, 59% (95% confidence interval: 57% to 61%) of people testing positive reported symptoms. There is no statistical evidence that the percentage of people reporting symptoms has changed between August and September 2021. The percentage of people reporting symptoms was lower in the period between March and May 2021. During this period, the positivity rate was also lower in comparison to other months, and there was a lower average viral load during this time. This could potentially explain the lower percentage of people reporting symptoms between March and May 2021.\nSymptoms reported were more likely to be \"classic\" symptoms than gastrointestinal or loss of taste or smell only. The prevalence of \u201cclassic\u201d, \u201closs of taste or smell\u201d and any symptoms was generally lower between March and May 2021 compared with other months, where prevalence was higher. This is consistent with lower average viral load between March and May 2020.\nIn the UK, the most commonly reported symptoms have consistently been cough, fatigue and headache. The least commonly reported symptoms have consistently been abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea or vomiting. The prevalence of loss of smell, loss of taste, fever, cough, fatigue, headache, myalgia, diarrhoea, and nausea and vomiting was lower in the period between March and May 2021 when positivity was lower in comparison to other months. However, confidence intervals are wide and overlap with previous months\u2019 estimates.\nData on the percentage of people reporting specific symptoms by month for the UK, and by country for the total time period studied can be found in the accompanying dataset.\nThe percentage of strong positive cases where any symptoms were reported appears to be slightly lower in Northern Ireland, although confidence intervals overlap with other countries. This may be driven by slightly fewer people reporting loss of taste and smell (which is a classic symptom) compared with England, Wales and Scotland. In addition, our sampling method for Northern Ireland is different to the other nations, inviting only people who have previously participated in a Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) survey, which could result in a sample of individuals who are less likely to report symptoms.\nPatterns of the prevalence of specific symptoms are similar for each UK country, and align with data for the whole of the UK.\n\n!\n\nBecause of a smaller number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison to England in our sample, the confidence intervals are wider indicating higher uncertainty. \n\n\n\nThis analysis considers all symptoms reported at survey visits within 35 days of the first positive test of the episode, and at each survey visit we ask about symptoms in the last seven days. This includes symptoms reported even when there is a negative test result within this timeframe or a positive test result with a higher Ct value. The strength of the test is determined by how quickly the virus is detected, measured by a Ct value. The lower the Ct value, the higher the viral load and stronger the positive test. We look at strong positive test results with a Ct of less than 30 to exclude the possibility that symptoms are not identified because we pick up individuals very early or later on in their infection. More details on this analysis can be found in Section 8.\nIndividuals taking part in the survey were asked at each visit whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms1 in the seven days before they were tested, and also separately whether they felt that they had symptoms compatible with a coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in the last seven days.\nThis section looks at how often individuals are reporting social contact (either socially distanced or physical contact) with other people outside their own household, regardless of whether they have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). We asked school-age children (aged 2 years to School Year 11) and adults (School Year 12 and over) how many people aged 17 years and under, 18 to 69 years, and 70 years and over they have had contact with outside their household up to seven days prior to each survey visit. \"Contact\" refers to either of the following:\nsocially distanced contact\nphysical contact, such as a handshake or personal care, including while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)\nWe report on recent trends in this section, but the full time series for this analysis, which covers the period between 11 July 2020 and 2 October 2021 for England, and 19 September 2020 to 2 October 2021 for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, is available in the accompanying dataset. The analysis for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland starts at a later date because data collection started later in these countries. Our estimates have been weighted to be representative of the total population in each of the four UK countries.\nThe trends in socially distanced and physical contacts are very similar for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and are broadly unchanged since our last bulletin.\nAcross all four UK nations, the number of socially distanced and physical contacts that adults and school-age children reported with people of all ages outside their household has been increasing since March 2021, although school age children had fewer contacts during the school holidays. Adults appear to consistently have more socially distanced and physical contacts with those aged 18 to 69 years than with those aged under 18 years or aged 70 years and over. School-age children appear to have had more socially distanced and physical contacts with those aged under 18 years.\nSchool term dates, and COVID-19 related school policies vary by nation and this is reflected in the data. For example, in the 14-day period up to 3 September 2021, there was an increase in school age children reporting contact with those aged under 18 years in Northern Ireland and Scotland. A similar increase was seen in England and Wales in the 14-day period up to 2 October 2021. The differing times of these increases correspond to schools reopening at different times after the summer holidays in Northern Ireland and Scotland compared with England and Wales.\nFurther information on the schedule for school re-openings can be viewed for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Information on lockdown easing can be viewed for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nOur findings are generally similar to those reported in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN), which examines the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain. The most recent OPN bulletin reported that among 3,400 adult respondents in Great Britain, from 22 September to 3 October 2021:\na smaller proportion of adults (40%) reported that they always or often maintained social distancing when outside their home compared with 45% in the previous period, a figure which has steadily decreased since the start of May 2021\njust over half of adults (55%) reported that they avoided physical contact with others outside their home in the past seven days, a reduction of 4 percentage points from the previous period (59%)\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, characteristics of people testing positive for COVID-19, UK Dataset | Released 21 October 2021 Characteristics of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) taken from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.

To account for differences in population size and age structure of the vaccination status groups over time, we calculated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19) (Figure 1) using the Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) dataset (see Measuring the data). This is a dataset containing people who reside in England who could be linked to the 2011 Census and the GP Patient Register 2019, which covers approximately 79% of people aged 10 years and over living in England. ASMRs for all-cause deaths and age-specific rates for deaths involving COVID-19 are also included in the accompanying dataset.\nThe vaccination status is split by dose and time since vaccination, to allow for the increase in protection in the first few weeks after vaccination. The vaccination status is one of:\nunvaccinated\nreceived only the first dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived only the first dose, at least 21 days ago\nreceived the second dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived the second dose, at least 21 days ago\nThe ASMRs for deaths involving COVID-19 and all causes for vaccination status groups over the period 2 January to 24 September 2021 (Week 1 to Week 38) are shown in Table 1. These ASMRs are calculated in person-years at risk to account for the different time people spent in each vaccination state in the period.\nThe ASMRs for total deaths and deaths involving COVID-19 are significantly higher among people who are unvaccinated than people who had received either one or two doses. The ASMR for deaths involving COVID-19 for unvaccinated people is 32 times greater than that of people who had received two doses at least 21 days ago.\n\n!\n\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) can be affected by differing characteristics of the population in the vaccination status groups and the changing COVID-19 infection rate. Therefore, the ASMRs do not show causal links between vaccines and risk of mortality. \n\n\n\nDownload the data\nAs shown in Figure 1, the weekly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for people who had received two vaccination doses are lower than those for people who have received one dose or are unvaccinated in every week of the period. The weekly ASMRs for people who had received only one dose are in general lower than the ASMRs for people who were unvaccinated but higher than those for people who had received two vaccination doses.\nWeekly age-specific mortality rates were calculated for aggregated age groups rather than the usual five-year age groups because of low numbers of deaths in some age groups which could pose a risk of disclosure of the vaccination status of individuals and result in unstable estimates. The age-specific rates are included in the accompanying dataset and can be used to highlight which age groups are driving changes in the age-standardised mortality rates. \n\n!\n\nThe weekly counts of total deaths and deaths involving COVID-19 will not equal those in other Office for National Statistics publications because we use the Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) as the population for the ASMRs. See Glossary. \n\n\n\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) allow for comparison of mortality rates of populations with different age structures, as the population is standardised in five-year age groups to a standard population. Information on how ASMRs are calculated can be found in our Methodology article. Age standardisation is important when comparing mortality rates of different vaccination status groups, as the age structures of the populations differ greatly between the groups and over time.\nWhile the ASMRs provide evidence that vaccinated individuals have a lower risk of dying of coronavirus (COVID-19) than unvaccinated individuals, they cannot be used to determine vaccine effectiveness. This is because the populations in each vaccine status group are likely to differ in ways other than population size and age because of the selective roll out of the vaccination programme and differences in vaccine uptake. Care should be taken in interpreting trends in the ASMRs as these cannot be causally linked to vaccinations. Differences between the groups and over time, such as health status, can have a particularly large effect on the ASMRs, especially when the population becomes unrepresentative of the age group in general. This can happen if people with particular characteristics, such as poor health, remain in a particular vaccination status group.\nFor example, the total mortality rate for the \"21 days or more after first dose\" group increases sharply from approximately week 13 to week 19 (Table 2 of the accompanying dataset). However, looking at\u00a0the percentage of elderly people who are in this vaccination status group (Table 4 of the accompanying dataset), we see that this drops\u00a0to very low levels around\u00a0the same weeks, therefore the mortality rates are based on a very small percentage of the elderly population, which may not be representative of the elderly population in general. For example, this group may include people who did not receive a second vaccination after receiving the first because of being hospitalised for a serious condition. Similar patterns are observed for the \"unvaccinated\" and \"within 21 days of first dose\" groups at earlier times of the year. This effect is much reduced as age decreases.\nTo calculate age-specific mortality rates and age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs), we need to know both the number of deaths and the number of living people in each age group and their vaccination status. There are different approaches to determining the population, which affect the reported mortality rates and ASMRs. If the population is estimated using the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) or people registered with a GP, this can result in an overestimate of the unvaccinated population because of the inclusion of people who have died or moved away. Conversely, using Office for National Statistics (ONS) population estimates and deriving the unvaccinated population as the difference to the number of vaccinated people, could result in underestimating the unvaccinated population if the ONS population estimates are lower than the true value.\nWe used the Public Health Data Asset, a dataset based on the 2011 Census, linked to mortality data and NIMS vaccination data, to obtain both the numerators and denominators for mortality rates. This covers approximately 79% of all people aged 10 years and over and the use of the census linked to GP records means there should be minimal overestimation of the unvaccinated population.\nEstimates of ASMRs by vaccination status are also published by Public Health England. In addition to the use of a different population, these estimates define vaccination status at the date of infection rather than the date of death and therefore are not equivalent to the rates in this bulletin.\nPublished studies have calculated vaccine effectiveness using observational methods, taking into account known differences in characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and confirming the lack of bias because of remaining unobserved differences between the groups. All three vaccines have reported vaccine effectiveness of over 90% against coronavirus (COVID-19) mortality (PDF, 2.29MB).\n\nDeaths by vaccination status, England Dataset | Released 1 November 2021 Weekly age-standardised mortality rates and age-specific rates for deaths involving COVID-19 and all deaths by vaccination status.

In comparison, 96% of all adults self-reported being vaccinated.\n\n!\n\nThe estimates presented here are from a sample of adults, and may differ from the latest official administrative data on the\u00a0number of adults in England who have received a COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\n\nVaccine hesitancy previously reported from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) was highest among young adults. However, when following up with this group, they were more likely to change their attitudes and are now vaccinated (46% of 18 to 29 year olds). This can partially be explained by a higher percentage of this group reporting they were unsure they would have a vaccine if offered, meaning that they were undecided and open to change.\nOlder adults initially reported low vaccine hesitancy, however, when following up, a lower percentage had changed their attitudes and had a vaccine (19% of those 70 years and older).\nIn previous analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in vaccine hesitancy between clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and non-CEV adults. However, on following up, vaccine uptake was lower for CEV adults. Less than 2 in 10 (16%) of CEV previously hesitant adults are now vaccinated, compared with over 4 in 10 (42%) of non-CEV adults.\nThose aged 70 years and over and CEV adults were prioritised in the vaccine rollout, and among those who were previously vaccine hesitant a large proportion had declined the vaccine (62% and 68%, respectively), which suggests they were less likely to change their minds about the vaccine.\nPreviously published analysis showed higher rates of vaccine hesitancy among Black or Black British adults when compared with White adults. Among those that were previously vaccine hesitant, there were similar vaccine attitudes when they first responded to OPN, in that there was no significant difference between these ethnic groups in whether they were unsure, unlikely or had declined a vaccine if offered. This partially explains why when we followed up, there was a similar vaccine uptake between Black or Black British and White adults (47% and 42%, respectively).\nIn previous analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in vaccine hesitancy between disabled and non-disabled adults. However, when we followed up, vaccine uptake was lower for disabled adults. Around one-third (34%) of previously vaccine hesitant disabled adults had been vaccinated compared with almost half (46%) of previously vaccine hesitant non-disabled adults. This suggest that disabled adults were more likely to have deep rooted concerns about a vaccine and, therefore, were less likely to have it. This is also likely as a higher percentage of previously vaccine hesitant disabled adults who remained unvaccinated reported being worried about the effect on an existing health condition.\nThe following groups previously reported lower vaccine hesitancy, and when we followed-up they had higher vaccine uptake. Their rates of vaccination were:\n47% of those who were employed or self-employed compared with 38% for those who were unemployed\n46% of those able to afford an unexpected expense of \u00a3850 compared with 40% of those unable\n52% of those living in the least deprived areas compared with 39% of those living in the\u00a0most deprived (see Glossary for definition of Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintiles)\n50% of those whose highest qualification was a degree or equivalent compared with 26% of those with no qualifications\n44% of those who own their home compared with 37% of those renting\nAll analysis in this section relates to the 44% of previously coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine-hesitant adults who are now vaccinated.\nOf this group, 86% said it was easy or very easy to get their first dose, 9% said it was neither easy nor difficult, and 5% said it was difficult or very difficult. Additionally, 76% did not report difficulties when getting a vaccine (compared with 85% of all adults in England over the period 22 September to 3 October 2021).\nWhen asked whether they had experienced any specific difficulties when getting a vaccine, the most commonly reported was a long wait at the vaccination site (9% compared with 6% of all adults in England over the period 22 September to 3 October 2021).\nPreviously vaccine-hesitant adults who are now vaccinated were presented with a list of motivations for vaccination, covering the themes: motivational and socio-psychological drivers, reasons related to their ability to take part in daily activities, and vaccination incentives. From this list of response options, the majority reported they were motivated to have a first dose for restrictions to ease and life to return to normal (65%), followed by wanting to protect themselves (61%) and\u00a0others (57%) from the coronavirus.\nAll analysis in this section relates to the 55% of previously vaccine-hesitant adults who remained unvaccinated.\nOf this group, when asked about health-related reasons which stopped them from having a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, 58% said they were worried about side effects, followed by long-term effects of the vaccine (54%) or not thinking that the vaccine was safe (32%).\nRegarding trust-related reasons, the two most common reported were thinking the vaccine had been developed too quickly (55%) and wanting to wait to see how well the vaccine works (45%).\nLooking at risk-related reasons, around one-third (34%) said that they did not feel at risk from the coronavirus because of their good health. However, 40% reported \"None of the above\" in response to the list of risk-related reasons for remaining unvaccinated.\u00a0\nThose previously hesitant who remained unvaccinated were also presented with a list of reasons that were potential motivations of vaccination. This group was less likely to report reasons that could motivate them to have a vaccine, compared with the reasons that actually motivated those who are now vaccinated (see Section 4).\nAmong those previously hesitant who remained unvaccinated, wanting to protecting others or themselves from coronavirus would motivate them to have the vaccine (19% for both). However, a high proportion also responded \"None of the above\" to reasons listed within the themes: informational and socio-psychological factors (65%), ability to take part in daily activities (67%) and vaccine incentives (76%). This suggests that what would motivate them to get a vaccine was not included in the survey or this group's concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine are deep-rooted.\nOf the 29% of previously vaccine-hesitant adults who are now fully vaccinated, a higher percentage reported they were very or fairly unlikely to have a COVID-19 vaccine booster (22%) compared with all fully vaccinated adults in England (3%).\nOf previously vaccine-hesitant adults who are fully vaccinated but were unlikely to have a booster jab, 60% did not think it would offer them any extra protection against COVID-19. Around half (47%) thought their first and second doses will provide enough protection, while 46% were worried about long-term effects of the booster on their health. This compares with 35%, 52% and 23% of all adults who are fully vaccinated and unlikely to have a booster vaccine in England, respectively.\nThose previously vaccine-hesitant adults who were very or fairly unlikely, don\u2019t know or prefer not to say to have a vaccine booster jab, were asked what would motivate them to have a vaccine booster. The most common reasons reported were related to ability to take part in daily activities, specifically, easing of restrictions and life returning to normal (34%) and making it easier to go on holiday abroad (30%). However, 44% reported \"None of the above\" for these reasons. A high proportion also responded \u201dNone of the above\u201d to reasons related to informational and socio-psychological factors (55%) and vaccine incentives (63%). This is consistent with the responses\u00a0of previously vaccine-hesitant adults who remain unvaccinated, when asked about their potential motivations to have a vaccine (Section 5).\n\nCoronavirus and vaccine attitudes in England Dataset | Released 9 November 2021 Indicators from the Vaccine Opinions Study to understand changes in uptake and attitudes towards the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, amongst adults in England who previously reported they had declined the vaccine or were unlikely or unsure about having the vaccine if offered.Coronavirus and vaccines supplementary table  Dataset | Released 9 November 2021  Indicators from the Opinions and Lifestyle survey on hesitancy, uptake, boosters and barriers to the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines in England. \n\n\n", "summary": "Over 4 in 10 previously hesitant adults now vaccinated\nA follow-up survey of adults in England who previously reported being hesitant about the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine has shown over 4 in 10 (44%) have now been vaccinated.\nAccording to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, overall vaccine-hesitancy declined from 10% to 3% of all adults between 13 January and 8 August 2021.\nWhile previous analysis showed vaccine-hesitancy was higher among young adults, vaccine uptake was higher among this group when revisited by the Vaccine Opinions Survey.\nAmong previously vaccine-hesitant adults, 46% of those aged 18 to 29 years have now been vaccinated, compared with 19% of those aged 70 years and above.\nWhile vaccine-hesitancy was previously higher among Black and Black British adults compared with White adults, the follow-up survey showed similar vaccine uptake between these two groups (47% and 42% respectively).\nAdults who previously self-reported vaccine-hesitancy are those who declined a vaccine (25%) or were unlikely (33%) or unsure (42%) about having a vaccine if offered.\nAmong these groups, subsequent vaccine uptake was highest among those who were unsure (60%) and lowest among those who initially declined (21%).\nPercentages in the chart above may not sum to 100% as they exclude those who said \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cPrefer not to say\u201d, and those waiting for an appointment.\nLooking at all previously vaccine-hesitant adults, 44% have now been vaccinated, while 55% remain unvaccinated.

It takes between two and three weeks after infection or vaccination for the body to make enough antibodies to fight the infection. Having antibodies can help to prevent individuals from getting the same infection again. Once infected or vaccinated, antibodies remain in the blood at low levels and can decline over time. The length of time antibodies remain at detectable levels in the blood is not fully known.\nCommunity population \u2013 in this instance community population refers to private residential households, and excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings.\nSARS-CoV-2 \u2013 this is the scientific name given to the specific virus that causes COVID-19.\nIt is not yet known how having detectable antibodies, now or at some time in the past, affects the chance of getting COVID-19 again as other parts of the immune system (T cell response) will offer protection. Antibody positivity is defined by a fixed amount of antibodies in the blood. A negative test result will occur if there are no antibodies or if antibody levels are too low to reach this threshold. It is important to draw the distinction between testing positive for antibodies and having immunity.\nFollowing infection or vaccination, antibody levels can vary and sometimes increase but are still below the level identified as \"positive\" in our test, and other tests. This does not mean that a person has no protection against COVID-19, as an immune response does not rely on the presence of antibodies alone. We also do not yet know exactly how much antibodies need to rise to give protection.\u00a0A person's T cell response will provide protection\u00a0but is not detected by blood tests for antibodies.\u00a0A person's immune response is affected by a number of factors, including health conditions and age. Additional information on the link between antibodies and immunity and the\u00a0vaccine programme\u00a0can be found in our\u00a0latest blog.\nThis article presents analysis on past infection and/or vaccination \u2013 which we define as testing positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland based on findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey in the UK. We have also included estimates from our survey on the proportion of people who reported they have received at least one dose of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, as well as those who have been fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.\nWhile the daily official government figures provide the recorded actual numbers of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 issued, our vaccination estimates are likely to be different from the official figures. This is because they are estimates based on a sample survey of reported vaccine status and are provided for context alongside our antibodies estimates. Importantly, our survey collects information from the population living in private households and does not include people living in communal establishments such as care homes, hospitals or prisons. The value of showing our estimates of vaccines alongside our estimates of people testing positive for antibodies is to illustrate the relationship between the two.\nDifferences between official figures and the estimates from this survey differ in scale across each of the four nations (some survey estimates are closer to the official reported figures than others) because of differences in reporting dates and the inclusion of National Immunisation Management System (NIMS)1 data for England. This should be taken into consideration if comparing vaccine estimates across the four nations. In addition, as our analysis develops, our survey-based estimates will enable possible future analysis of people who have received a vaccine with other characteristics collected in the survey. Our recently published blog provides more information on what the Office for National Statistics (ONS) can tell you about the COVID-19 vaccine programme.\nOur\u00a0methodology article\u00a0provides further information around the survey design, how we process data, and how data are analysed. The\u00a0study protocol\u00a0specifies the research for the study. Further information on what the analysis covers is provided at the start of each section.\nThe analysis on antibodies in this article is based on blood test results taken from a randomly selected subsample of individuals aged 16 years and over, which are used to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.\nAntibody estimates are based on a model where England, Wales and Scotland are included together in a spatial-temporal model; Northern Ireland is modelled separately. This reflects the geography of the four countries as Northern Ireland does not share a land border with Great Britain; the geo-spatial model incorporates physical land distance between regions.\nThis modelling approach means we are able to provide weekly estimates while adjusting to make the estimates representative of the population. The data are modelled on standardised Monday to Sunday surveillance weeks and we present data beginning 7 December 2020. Further information on our method to model antibodies can be found in our\u00a0methods article.\nWe also present data on the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who report they have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine since 14 December 2020, and the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who are fully vaccinated since 15 February 2021.\nThe estimates of the percentage of people vaccinated are based on modelling of the people visited in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey in the community. These estimates are then adjusted (post-stratified) using population estimates to be representative (in the same way as for the antibody analysis).\nWe are presenting weekly modelled antibody estimates by country, grouped age, single year of age, sex, and grouped age and sex, for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, as well as by regions in England. In Sections 3, 4, 5 and 7, we report on modelled antibodies estimates for the most recent time period available, which is the week beginning 19 April 20212.Modelled antibody estimates for previous weeks can be found in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nWe are presenting trends in weekly modelled vaccination estimates for adults who reported they have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and adults who report they are fully vaccinated, by country, grouped age, sex, and grouped age and sex for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, as well as by regions in England. In Sections 3, 4, 5 and 7, we report on modelled vaccination estimates for the same week as we report for antibodies estimates, which is the week beginning 19 April 2021. Modelled vaccination estimates for previous weeks can be found in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nThese modelled estimates are produced to provide context alongside our antibodies estimates and do not replace the\u00a0official government figures on vaccines, which are a more precise count of total vaccines issued. While we would expect the overall trend of our estimated number of people who have received vaccines to increase, it is possible that in some weeks, the estimate may remain the same or decrease as a result of sampling variability (for example, we may have a lower number of participants recording a vaccination in the latest week compared with an earlier week).\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

The estimated percentage of adults who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 varied between 23.8% to 35.3% of adults across the UK in the week beginning 19 April 2021. These vaccination estimates for the community population will differ from official figures.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 or who have been vaccinated is low compared with England.

The percentage of adults who have received at least one dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is lowest in the younger age groups but is increasing.\nBased on our estimates, more than 99% of people aged 70 years and over have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine across the UK. Of those who have been fully vaccinated, the highest percentages are found in the oldest age groups and lowest among the younger age groups. The trend in the estimated percentage of adults in the community population who are fully vaccinated varies between the four countries of the UK. This is different to the official figures for the entire UK population.\nWhen antibodies are measured over time by age, it is possible to see the impact of the vaccination programme between first and second doses. In March 2021, antibody positivity decreased among people aged over 80 and has since increased as a result of second doses. A similar decrease is seen in those in their 70s at the end of March and can now be seen among those in their 60s. Additionally, in England, the number of first vaccinations administered was lower in April than in previous months, which may explain why the overall levels of antibody positivity has remained unchanged in recent weeks.\nThe percentage of adults testing positive for antibodies varies by age group between the four nations of the UK. This could be explained by different historical trends in COVID-19 infection rates and the approaches to vaccine distribution in different nations. This survey does not include people who live in care homes, one of the priority groups identified by the\u00a0Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Daily and weekly counts of vaccine doses administered by nation can be seen in the\u00a0Public Heath England (PHE) dashboard.\nModelled antibody estimates and modelled vaccine estimates relate to the adult community population (aged 16 years and over) who live in private households and does not include establishments such as care homes. The true figure among the older age groups in the population may be different. In England, an estimated\u00a090% of people aged 80 years and over live in private households\u00a0and 10% live in other establishments such as care homes.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 or who have been vaccinated is low compared with England. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in estimates for these nations, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nDownload the data\nThe analysis in this section presents modelled daily estimates of antibody positivity by single year of age for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland separately, between 26 February and 22 April 2021. The modelled data in this section are produced using a different method to the weekly modelled estimates presented in Section 5 and so cannot be compared. Each data point represents a modelled estimate of antibody positivity for a particular day.\nFigure 4 shows a decrease in the estimated percentage of adults testing positive for antibodies in the older ages in early to mid March 2021. Antibody positivity has since risen again in the older ages. This is likely to reflect the increase in individuals receiving the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\nDownload the data\n\n!\n\nIt is unclear if decreasing levels of antibodies means that protection is decreasing. Further work to understand this is being undertaken. \n\n\n\nThe analysis in this section presents modelled weekly estimates of antibody positivity and vaccination by sex, and by age and sex for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The modelled data in this section were produced using the same modelling method as in Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5. We have provided weekly antibody positivity estimates covering the time period 8 March to 22 April 2021, and vaccination estimates for 15 March to 25 April 2021.\nModelled estimates of antibody positivity and vaccination by sex are presented in Figure 5. Both these and modelled estimates of antibody positivity and vaccination by age and sex are available in the accompanying dataset.\nThe percentage of adults who would have tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a blood sample were broadly similar for males and females across all four UK countries, with slightly more females testing positive than males in England, Wales and Scotland.\nThe estimated percentage of adults who reported they have received one or more doses of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and the estimated percentage who reported they are fully vaccinated was higher for females than males between 15 March and 25 April 2021 in England, Wales and Scotland. Vaccination estimates were similar for males and females in Northern Ireland.\nAcross all UK countries, when broken down by age group, the same trends were observed for antibody positivity for males and females, regardless of age. The trend in the estimated percentage of adults who have received one or more doses of a vaccine remained the same in younger age groups, with more females reporting having the vaccine than males, but the percentage was similar for male and females in older age groups. The estimated percentage of adults who reported they are fully vaccinated was higher for females than males in majority of age groups, but estimates were similar in the oldest age groups across all four countries. This is likely to reflect the vaccination programmes across the UK with older ages being prioritised for first and second doses.\nDownload the data\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) antibody data for the UK Dataset | Released 13 May 2021 Antibody data for the UK taken from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.

The number of first vaccinations administered was also lower in April than in previous months.\nIn Wales, an estimated 63.2% of adults would have tested positive for antibodies. In Northern Ireland, 63.5% would have tested positive, and in Scotland 59.2%.\nAcross all four UK countries, there is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for antibodies, although antibodies alone are not a precise measure of immunity acquired from vaccination.\nIn the week beginning 19 April, we estimate between 61.9% and 73.0% of the UK population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with between 23.8% and 35.3% of adults having received both doses.\nAntibody positivity and vaccination are higher in older age groups, reflecting the age prioritisation in the UK\u2019s vaccination programme.\nWe have seen antibody positivity wane briefly in some age groups before the effect of second vaccine doses. In March, antibody positivity decreased among people aged over 80 years, before increasing again as second doses were administered. A similar pattern was seen among those in their 70s at the end of March, and a drop in positivity is now seen among those in their 60s.\n", "id": 443}, {"document": "In May 2021 (Round 5), 0.65% of primary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 0.27% to 1.29%) and 0.05% of secondary school pupils (95% confidence intervals: 0.01% to 0.18%) tested positive for current infection for COVID-19.\nFor Round 5 we are unable to report staff current infection to COVID-19 because of the low numbers testing positive.\nFor primary school staff, the seroconversion rate between Round 4 and 5 was 1.4 per 1,000 person weeks; this was significantly lower than the seroconversion rate seen between Round 2 and Round 4.\nSecondary school staff had a seroconversion rate between Round 4 and 5 of 2.1 per 1,000 person weeks; this was not statistically different to the rate seen between Round 2 and Round 4.\nIn Round 5, 24.37% of primary school staff (95% confidence intervals: 19.75% to 29.47%) and 21.79% of secondary school staff (95% confidence intervals: 19.42% to 24.30%) tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies; this difference is not statistically significant.\nBy the end of May 2021, 86.58% of staff had received at least one dose and 43.09% had received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccination.\n43% of primary school parents and 53% of secondary school parents would definitely want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Only 4% of primary school parents and 3% of secondary school parents would definitely not want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n!\n\nData presented are not intended to be generally applicable to all schools in England. The study was originally designed to over-sample schools in areas of England where COVID-19 infection was highest at the start of the academic year (September 2020). Further information can be found in the\u00a0methodology\u00a0article. \n\n\n\n\n!\n\nThe antibody tests used in this study detect antibodies produced following natural infection and not vaccination. \n\n\n\n\nHave you been asked to take part in the study?For more information, please visit the SIS participant\u00a0guidance page.If you have any further questions on the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey (SIS), you can telephone IQVIA helpline on 0800 917 9679 or email\u00a0iqvia.schoolinfectionsurvey@nhs.net. \n\n\nFigure 1 shows the percentage of primary and secondary school pupils testing positive for current coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Round 5 (5 to 21 May 2021). 0.65% of primary school pupils that were present in the school building on the day of testing tested positive (95% confidence interval: 0.27% to 1.29%) compared with 0.05% of secondary school pupils (95% confidence interval: 0.01% to 0.18%).\nThe number of positive test results in Round 5 from primary and secondary school staff is too small to present because of statistical disclosure criteria.\nDespite over-sampling in the North West where the Delta variant was most prevalent in May we found very low numbers of positive cases in the schools.\nMost of our positive cases were compatible with the Alpha variant. In Round 5, 84% of all COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey (SIS) positive cases were compatible with the Alpha variant compared with 96% in Round 4. Suggesting that, at the time of testing, the Delta variant was still concentrated in very specific areas of the country that were not sampled in SIS. \nIn Round 5, tests have been returned for 142 schools, of which 131 (92%) returned no positive cases among participants tested as part of the study and 11 schools returned one or two cases. Of these 11 schools, eight were in the North West (13% of schools tested in this region had at least one positive case compared with 4% of the SIS schools located elsewhere).\nThe percentage of secondary school pupils testing positive for current COVID-19 infection in Round 5 was significantly lower than in the Autumn term of 2020; this can be seen in Figure 2.\nFigure 3 shows the percentage of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Round 5 (5 to 21 May 2021); 24.37% of primary school staff tested positive (95% confidence intervals: 19.75% to 29.47%) compared with 21.79% of secondary school staff (95% confidence intervals: 19.42% to 24.30%).\nThe antibody test used in this study detects antibodies produced following natural infection; antibodies resulting from coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination will not be detected. This is different to the antibody test used in the Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS), which will detect antibodies from vaccination as well as infection, as reported in their latest article. The figures reported in this bulletin are therefore lower than those estimated for the overall household population in the CIS.\nThe percentage of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies continued to increase, for both primary school and secondary school staff between Round 4 and Round 5; this can be seen in Figure 4.\n\n\nFigure 4: Percentage of primary and secondary school staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies\nEngland, 3 to 20 November 2020 (Round 1), 30 November to 11 December 2020 (Round 2), 15 to 31 March 2021 (Round 4) and 5 to 21 May 2021 (Round 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nTo ensure consistent comparisons between rounds, only the 11 local authorities with coverage in Rounds 1, 2, 4 and 5, for at least two primary and two secondary schools in the sample are included in the total figures provided.

Confidence intervals are wide, so all estimates should be interpreted with caution, however, the general trends observed are in line with expectations given infection trends in the wider community.\nIn the case of the coronavirus (COVID-19) antibody; seroconversion is the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results changing from negative to positive and will capture both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections that may have been missed between testing rounds.\nTo account for the different follow-up times between the rounds (on average the follow-up time between Rounds 1 and 2 was three weeks, 15 weeks between Rounds 2 and 4, and eight weeks between Rounds 4 and 5), the seroconversion rate has been calculated and expressed per 1,000 person-weeks. More details on this\u00a0approach are available in the methodology\u00a0note.\nFigure 5 shows the seroconversion rate of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; between Rounds 4 and 5 the seroconversion rate for primary school staff was 1.4 per 1,000 person-weeks (95% confidence intervals: 0.5 to 3.9 per 1,000 person-weeks). This rate is significantly lower than the seroconversion rates seen between Rounds 2 to 4.\nThe secondary school staff had a seroconversion rate between Round 4 and 5 of 2.1 per 1,000 person weeks (95% confidence intervals: 0.9 to 4.8 per 1,000 person-weeks). This was not statistically different to the rates seen between Rounds 1 and 2 or between Rounds 2 and 4.\nStaff vaccination data were obtained by linking to the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS). Details of the data matching can be found in our\u00a0methodology article. Of the staff participating where immunisation status was available, 86.58% had received at least one vaccination dose by the end of May 2021 (95% confidence intervals: 84.28% to 88.65%), and 43.09% had received both doses (95% confidence intervals: 39.96% to 46.27%).\nVaccination data by age and local authority results can be found in the accompanying\u00a0dataset.\nAs our vaccination rates relate to school staff in 14 local authorities and cannot be generalised to all school staff in England, the data in this bulletin will differ from the\u00a0administrative data on vaccinations\u00a0published weekly by NHS England. The administrative data cover all vaccinations given to individuals who have an NHS number and are currently alive in the resident population.\nBetween 12 April and 21 May 2021, parents were asked to complete a short questionnaire about their views towards their children receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Analysis was carried out on 4,439 responses received from parents with children under the age of 16 years (a response rate of 28%) and has been weighted to be representative of all children under 16 years in the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey (SIS) local authorities (as SIS oversamples local authorities in the North West of England these findings are not necessarily generalisable to England as a whole).\nIn response to the question \"If a COVID-19 vaccine was offered to your child, would you want them to have the vaccine\", 43% of primary school parents and 53% of secondary school parents responded that they \"Yes, definitely\" would want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine. Some 4% of primary school parents and 3% of secondary school parents said they would \"Definitely not\" want their child to have a vaccine, as seen in Figure 6.\nThe most common reasons given by parents who said that they would definitely not want their child to have a vaccine were:\nnot enough research has been carried out\nwanting more information on the long-term side effects\nconcerns about vaccine safety and side effects\n\nMore about coronavirus  Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

The survey cannot report staff infection rates due to the low number of positive cases.\nDespite oversampling in the North West, where the Delta variant was most prevalent in May, the survey found very low numbers of such cases. Over four in five (84%) positive cases were compatible with the Alpha variant compared to 96% in Round 4 (March 2021), suggesting that the Delta variant was still concentrated in specific areas of the country at the time of testing.\nFor primary school staff, the seroconversion rate between Round 4 and 5 (March and May 2021) was 1.4 per 1,000 person weeks, compared with 2.1 per 1,000 in secondary schools during the same period. The rate in primary schools was significantly lower than the rate seen between Round 2 and 4 (December 2020 and March 2021).\nThe seroconversion rate tells us how many people have developed antibodies, capturing both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections that may have been missed between testing rounds. In May, 24.37% of primary school staff and 21.79% of secondary school tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Almost 9 in 10 (86.58%) staff had received at least one dose, and 43.09% had received both doses of COVID-19 vaccination.\n", "id": 495}, {"document": "Average life satisfaction for first year students was 6.6 (out of 10), similar to all students (6.5), but lower than those aged 16 to 29 years in general (6.9), and significantly lower than the adult population of Great Britain (7.1).\nWhen asked about how they felt over the previous two weeks, 37% of first year students showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression and 39% showed signs of likely having some form of anxiety.\nWhen asked if their mental health and well-being had changed since the start of the Autumn term 2021, 43% of first year students reported that it had gotten much or slightly better; this is higher than was observed in a survey of all higher education (HE) students (32%).\nFirst year students indicated a clear preference for any mental health and well-being support to be face-to-face, with 70% reporting they would prefer this and only 13% saying they would prefer a virtual format.\nWhen asked about how prepared they felt for studying at university, 38% of first year students reported that the reduction in face-to-face learning since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic meant they did not feel well prepared.\nThe majority (90%) of first year students said they had already been vaccinated against COVID-19 at least once; with 78% reporting having had two doses and 11% having just one dose.\n\n!\n\nThe statistics presented are experimental statistics, so care needs to be taken when interpreting them.

However, average scores are lower than those for 16 to 29-year-olds as a whole (6.9), and statistically significantly lower than the adult population in Great Britain (7.1).\nWhen asked questions about how they have felt over the last two weeks, 37% of first year students showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression. This is statistically significantly higher than both the general population of those 16- to 29-year-olds\u00a0(22%) and the adult population of Great Britain (16%).\nAdditionally, when asked how anxious they felt in the same time period, responses from 39% of students indicated that some form of anxiety disorder was likely. This again is statistically significantly higher compared with 28% of 16 to 29-year-olds and 16% of the general adult population.\nPlease note that as this survey was conducted early in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, it is likely that this two-week period coincided with at least some of the students moving to or attending university for the first time. This may have contributed to these significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety.\nWhen asked if their mental health and well-being had changed since the start of the Autumn term 2021, 43% of first year students reported that it had gotten much or slightly better. This is higher than was observed in a survey of all higher education (HE) students (32%). In contrast, 23% said that their mental health or well-being was slightly or much worse now since starting, which is similar to what was reported by all students (26%).\nFor more information about how indicators of depression and anxiety were determined, read Section 8: Mental health and well-being measurements.\nStudents were also asked questions from the Sick, Control, One, Fat, Food (SCOFF) questionnaire to assess possible presence of an eating disorder. Overall, responses from 23% of first year students suggested possible issues with food or body image. Responses from 27% of students suggested that they may have an eating disorder.\nFor more information about how indicators of depression and anxiety were determined, read Section 8: Mental health and well-being measurements.\nOver a fifth (21%) of first year students reported that they had engaged with mental health and well-being services since September 2020. The most frequently used services were general practice (GP) or primary care (47%), private counsellor or mental health service provider (30%), and the National Health Service (NHS) or Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme (28%).\nWhen asked what services they would use if they required mental health and well-being services in the future, 16% of students reported they would go to a GP or primary care service, while 17% would use an on-campus university healthcare service.\nStudents indicated a clear preference for any mental health and well-being support to be face-to-face, with 70% of students reporting they would prefer this, and only 13% saying they would prefer a virtual format.\nAlmost half (46%) of first year students reported that their academic performance had been significantly or majorly affected since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19)\u00a0pandemic. This is lower than the general student population (53%).\nWhen asked about how prepared they felt for studying at university, 38% of students reported that the reduction in face-to-face learning since the start of the coronavirus pandemic meant that they did not feel well prepared. In contrast, 18% of students did not feel affected and 14% reported feeling well prepared.\nThe majority (53%) of students said that they would prefer a blended learning format in the future, with a mix of face-to-face and virtual lectures or seminars.

For context, we include estimates from our survey on the percentage of people who reported they have received at least one or more doses of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, as well as those who report having received two or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine (including booster doses).\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the following:\nWe measure the presence of antibodies in people who live in private households to understand who has had coronavirus in the past, and the impact of vaccinations. It takes between two and three weeks after infection or vaccination for the body to make enough antibodies to fight the infection. Antibodies can help prevent individuals from getting the same infection again. If they do get infected, people with antibodies are less likely to have severe symptoms. Once infected or vaccinated, antibodies remain in the blood at low levels and can decline over time. The length of time antibodies remain at detectable levels in the blood is not fully known.\nThis is the scientific name given to the specific virus that causes COVID-19.\nThe analysis on antibodies in this bulletin is based on blood test results taken from a randomly selected subsample of individuals aged 16 years and over, who live in private households. The survey excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. The blood samples are used to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We also present data on the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who report they have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine since 14 December 2020, and the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who report they have received two or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine since 15 February 2021. The data include any reported booster or third jabs.\nOur antibodies and vaccination estimates are based on modelling of the people visited in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. Further information on our method to model antibodies and vaccinations can be found in\u00a0our methods article.\nWe produce weekly modelled estimates using standard calendar weeks starting Monday. To provide the most timely and accurate estimates possible for antibody positivity, the model will include data for the first four to seven days of the most recent week available, depending on the availability of test results. The antibody and vaccination estimates for the most recent week in this publication includes data from 27 September to 3 October 2021.\nAntibodies data\u00a0are currently\u00a0unavailable\u00a0for the period from\u00a026 August 2021 to 15 September 2021 because of a temporary issue in the laboratory testing process. We are working with our laboratories to resolve this issue and will receive data to cover this period\u00a0in the coming weeks.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor this week's analysis,\u00a0we have used a model which includes adjustments for the period of unavailable antibody\u00a0data.\u00a0The antibody\u00a0positivity estimates in the surveillance weeks\u00a0from\u00a016\u00a0August\u00a02021\u00a0to 26 September 2021 are modelled using\u00a0fewer data points meaning there is greater uncertainty for the estimates over this period. These results may be subject to revision\u00a0when\u00a0we receive\u00a0the\u00a0data\u00a0that covers the\u00a0period of\u00a0unavailable\u00a0antibody\u00a0data.\u00a0\nWe present weekly modelled antibody estimates for adults by country, and grouped age for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, as well as by regions in England. Single year of age analysis has not been updated in this week's publication.\u00a0We also include estimates of adults who reported they have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and of adults who reported they have received two or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine (including booster doses).\nThere is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies but the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination.\nModelled vaccine estimates are produced to provide context alongside our antibodies estimates and do not replace the\u00a0official government figures on vaccinations, which are a more precise count of total vaccines issued. While we would expect the overall trend of our estimated number of people who have received vaccines to increase, it is possible that in some weeks, the estimate may remain the same or decrease as a result of sampling variability (for example, we may have a lower number of participants recording a vaccination in the latest week compared with an earlier week).\nNational Immunisation Management System (NIMS) administrative data is used to validate CIS self-reported records of vaccination for England. The equivalent of this is currently not included for other countries, meaning the estimates for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are produced just from CIS self-reported records of vaccination.\nOur vaccination estimates are explained in more detail in Section 10: Measuring the data.\nAntibody positivity is defined by having a fixed concentration of antibodies in the blood. A negative test result occurs if there are no antibodies or if antibody levels are too low to reach a threshold at the time of testing. The threshold we use is 42ng/ml. This is the threshold that the test is CE marked against providing 99% sensitivity and specificity for coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Following infection or vaccination, antibody levels can vary and sometimes increase but may still be below the level identified as positive in our test and other tests, and so give a negative result.\nMost people who are vaccinated will retain a higher antibody level than before vaccination even after dropping below the standard threshold value. A negative result does not mean that the antibody level is at zero, nor that a person has no protection against COVID-19, as an immune response does not rely on the presence of antibodies alone.\nThere are other parts of the immune system which will offer protection, for example a person's T cell response. This will not be detected by blood tests for antibodies.\u00a0A person's immune response\u00a0is affected by a number of factors, including health conditions and age.\nEqually, antibody levels are expected to decrease over time irrespective of vaccination or natural infection, especially when exposure to the virus is reduced. This is because our bodies stop making antibodies when they are not needed.\nOur\u00a0blog on antibodies and immunity gives further information on the link between antibodies and immunity and the vaccine programme. Our\u00a0blogs on vaccine effectiveness provides information on the effectiveness of vaccinations against Alpha and Delta variants, which is based upon the research conducted by partners from the University of Oxford.\nOur\u00a0methodology article\u00a0provides further information around the survey design, how we process data, and how data are analysed. The\u00a0study protocol\u00a0specifies the research for the study. The\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information\u00a0details the strength and limitations of the data.\nThe percentage of adults who would have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies remained high across the UK in recent weeks up to the week beginning 27 September 2021.\nIn the week beginning 27 September 2021, our estimates suggest the percentage of adults who reported they had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine remained high, ranging from 93.8% to 95.2% of adults across the UK. The estimated percentage of adults in the UK who had received two or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine also remained high or continued to increase, ranging from 82.0% to 88.8% of adults across the UK in the week beginning 27 September 2021. These vaccination estimates will differ from official figures as explained in Section 1.\n.XLSX\nThe estimated percentage of adults who have received at least one coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, remained at a high level across all regions of England in the week beginning 27 September 2021. Regional data can be found in our\u00a0accompanying dataset.\nOur survey shows that in the week beginning 27 September 2021, the percentage of adults testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) antibodies remained high. It has increased in younger adults and is showing signs of a slow decline in older adults. \u00a0\nMany of the participants who have tested negative for antibodies in the most recent week, received their vaccinations in the early stages of the vaccination programme. Along with age, the early stages of the vaccination programme prioritised individuals on a range of factors (such as long-term health conditions and type of employment) and this may help to explain the declining trend appearing in different age groups now.\nAcross all four UK countries, antibody positivity remains high in older age groups (those aged 65 years and over) but has been declining in these age groups since the end of July 2021. It is important to note that antibody positivity is defined by a fixed concentration of antibodies in the blood. Most people who are vaccinated will retain higher antibody levels than before vaccination but may have a lower number of antibodies than this threshold at the time of testing. This does not mean that these people have no protection against new infection. More information on\u00a0antibodies and immunity\u00a0can be found in our blog and in Section 2 of this bulletin.\nWe estimate that the antibody positivity for those aged 16 to 24 years increased steadily across all four UK countries, with estimates ranging between 95.4% and 95.8% across the UK, for the week beginning 27 September 2021.\nThe percentage of adults who reported they have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine is lowest in the younger age groups but is increasing.\nAcross the four UK countries, the estimated percentage of adults aged 16 to 24 years who have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 79.1% to 82.8%; this has increased sharply since the end of June. These estimates of vaccination are based on reported vaccination status in our survey and are likely to be different from the\u00a0official figures\u00a0for the UK.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce estimates for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the number of people sampled who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 or who have been vaccinated is low compared with England. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in estimates for these nations when our analysis splits the sample into smaller groups (for example, age groups) as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nModelled antibody estimates and modelled vaccine estimates relate to the adult population (aged 16 years and over) who live in private households. The true figure among the older age groups in the population may be different. In England, an estimated\u00a090% of people aged 80 years and over live in private households\u00a0and 10% live in other communal establishments such as care homes.\n.XLSX\nAntibody and vaccination data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey was analysed in a research paper produced by our partners at Oxford University and\u00a0published as preprint\u00a0on 16 September 2021. The paper looks at how much antibodies change over time and how this varies between the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, by key characteristics. We summarise some of the relevant findings.\nOn average, antibody levels are initially higher and decline more slowly in people who have received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine compared with those who have received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In people who had received the Pfizer vaccine, the speed of decline in antibodies was faster in:\nmen\nolder people\nthose reporting white ethnicity\nthose with long-term health conditions\nPeople with a greater length of time between receiving their first and second AstraZeneca dose experienced a slightly higher peak in antibodies compared with those who had a shorter time between doses (considering gaps between 7 to 13 weeks). For people with a greater length of time between receiving their first and second Pfizer vaccine, the peak level of antibodies was slightly lower compared with those who had a shorter gap between doses. Those aged over 70 years had a much faster decline if they had received their second vaccination only three weeks after their first.\nWith both vaccines, prior infection significantly increased the peak in antibody levels after the second dose and slowed the decline in antibodies.\nAfter second doses of both vaccines, the peak level of antibodies was also higher in:\nwomen\npeople in patient-facing healthcare roles\npeople without long-term health conditions\nFurther detail and comparisons are available in\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibody responses after second dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 in the UK general population.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) antibody and vaccination data, UK Dataset | Released 27 October 2021 Antibody and vaccination data by UK country and regions in England from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey.

Positivity has increased in younger adults and is showing signs of a slow decline in older adults.\nAntibody positivity has been declining in older age groups since late July 2021. Many people in this group received their first vaccination early in the vaccination programme. Those aged 50 years and over, at-risk adults, and health and social care workers are currently being offered booster jabs.\nOur analysis defines antibody positivity by a fixed amount of antibodies in the blood. Most older people who are vaccinated will retain higher antibody levels than prior to vaccination, but may have a lower number of antibodies in the blood at the time of testing.

These differences are not statistically significant. \nEstimates of the positivity rate for pupils and staff are presented in Figure 1.\nFor pupils, the percentage of primary school pupils testing positive for current infection was 0.89% (95% confidence interval: 0.54% to 1.39%). The percentage of secondary school pupils testing positive for current infection was 1.48% (95% confidence interval: 1.10% to 1.98%); 19 out of 2,136 primary pupils and 46 out of 3,099 secondary pupils tested positive.\nFor school staff, the percentage of primary school staff testing positive for current infection was 0.75% (95% confidence interval: 0.32% to 1.47%).

Staff and pupils have similar percentages testing positive when comparing within school type (that is, primary pupils and primary staff) within the same area prevalence classification. \nIn secondary schools in high prevalence areas, 1.73% of pupils (95% confidence interval: 1.18% to 2.43%) and 1.62% of staff (95% confidence interval: 1.12% to 2.27%) tested positive for current infection (32 out of 1,853 pupils and 33 out of 2,035 staff).\nFor secondary schools in low prevalence areas, the percentage testing positive was 1.12% for pupils (95% confidence interval: 0.62% to 1.88%) and 1.18% for staff (95% confidence interval: 0.61% to 2.05%); 14 out of 1,246 pupils and 12 out of 1,019 staff.\nIn the first round of testing, 105 schools (63 secondary (60%) and 42 primary (40%) in 14 local authorities participated. Of the 14 local authorities, 9 (64.2%) were in high prevalence and 5 (35.8%) were in low prevalence areas. Within these schools, 11,194 participants (4,941 (44.1%) staff and 6,253 (55.9%) pupils) had enrolled by the test date. \nOf those tested for current infection in 105 schools, 47 schools (44.76%) had no current infections, 29 (27.62%) had 1 current infection and 29 (27.62%) had between 2 and 5 current infections.\nAt the time of this bulletin, almost half of schools enrolled in the first testing round (just under 50) had returned the questionnaire providing data on the infection control implementation measures in place. Therefore, the findings presented here, on implemented control measures, should be seen as indicative only. Future publications will examine the implemented infection control measures in more detail and explore the impact it has on current coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. \nThese initial results suggest that the number of infection control measures implemented varied across schools. Responses have been presented in our dataset, grouped by frequency of implementation. \nThe most implemented measures across primary and secondary schools include hand sanitizers, frequent hand washing and increased cleaning of frequently touched surfaces. The least implemented measure across primary and secondary schools is the wearing of masks or face coverings by students in the classroom.\nThis bulletin will be followed with more detailed analysis in subsequent publications, which will also incorporate data from further rounds of testing and antibody test results. This will help to explain more of the variability in schools and identify factors associated with high or low levels of infection by including variables related to individuals, such as age, sex and ethnicity.\nThis is one of a suite of surveillance studies, which are being conducted to understand how many people have the coronavirus (COVID-19), and how the virus spreads in non-household populations.

Section 6.\nIn the week to 14 October 2021, the aggregate CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases decreased by 5 percentage points from the previous week, to 97% of its February 2020 average; this was driven by decreases in \"staple\", \"work related\" and \"delayable\" spending categories (Bank of England CHAPS data). Section 7.\nAlmost one in six businesses (16%) intend to use increased homeworking as a permanent business model going forward, with the main reasons for this being improved staff well-being, reduced overheads and increased productivity (Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS)).

The number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour. The Adzuna categories used do not correspond to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Vacancy Survey.\nOf the 28 categories, 19 saw a weekly increase in the number of online job adverts, 3 were unchanged and 6 decreased when compared with the previous week. The largest weekly increase was in \u201csales\u201d, which rose by 34%; this figure should be treated with caution because of a large number of adverts from a single employer. The largest week-on-week decreases were in \u201cconstruction and trades\u201d and \u201cdomestic help\u201d, which fell by 15% and 12%, respectively. Of the 28 categories, only \u201cenergy, oil and gas\u201d and \u201clegal\u201d are below their February 2020 average level. \n\n\nFigure 2: The volume of job adverts in \u201ctransport, logistics and warehouse\u201d are over four times as high as the February 2020 average level, having increased by 6% from the previous week\nVolume of online job adverts by category, index: 100 = February 2020 average, 3 January 2020 to 15 October 2021, non-seasonally adjusted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Adzuna\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 2: The volume of job adverts in \u201ctransport, logistics and warehouse\u201d are over four times as high as the February 2020 average level, having increased by 6% from the previous week\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nDespite some week-on-week falls in the volume of job adverts in some parts of the UK, notably in Northern Ireland, which fell by 4%, the volume of online job adverts continued to trend gradually upwards in 8 of the 12 UK countries and English regions and all 12 remain substantially above their February 2020 average level. \nSystem average price (SAP) of gas are available in the\u00a0Data Item Explorer\u00a0from the National Grid.\nThe system average price (SAP) is the average price of all gas traded through the balancing market. Market participants post bids or offers for volumes of gas as day-ahead and within-day trades. The SAP aggregates the trades conducted on the On-the-Day Commodity Market (OCM). This is the market that National Grid use in their role as residual balancer. Other markets exist for wholesale gas trading in Great Britain.\nThese data can be used to understand the general trend of gas prices within Great Britain. However, they should be treated with caution as these can be subject to extreme within-day trading prices and may skew actual traded prices. It must also be noted that while these prices reflect spot prices on the day, traders can opt for futures contracts where the buyer and the seller agree the market-determined price for gas for a future date. The daily SAP is used to determine the futures price and is therefore a useful indicator of supply constraints and demand pressures.\u00a0\nThese data and the\u00a0accompanying dataset\u00a0are updated weekly in this bulletin.\n\n\nFigure 4: The preceding seven-day rolling average gas price decreased by 6% in the week to 17 October 2021\nSystem average price, pence per kilowatt hour, 1 January 2019 to 17 October 2021, Great Britain, non-seasonally adjusted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: National Grid\n\nNotes:\n\nThe price trends observed above will differ from that of the monthly Producer Price Inflation (PPI) series published by the ONS because of the differences in data sources and methods.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 4: The preceding seven-day rolling average gas price decreased by 6% in the week to 17 October 2021\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nSince the start of 2021, the seven-day rolling average SAP has been steadily increasing. The price has almost tripled since the start of the year, with an increase of 293% since 1 January 2021, and it has increased by 115% since 1 August 2021. However, in the latest week the SAP preceding seven-day average decreased by 6% to 7.262 pence per kilowatt hour. This is the largest weekly fall since 28 February 2021 but follows 13 consecutive weeks of price increases.\nThe full time series of actual day SAP and the preceding seven-day average, encompassing data from 2018 to the present, can be found in the\u00a0accompanying dataset.\nPret A Manger are a sandwich and coffee shop franchise chain, operating around 400 stores across the UK. Their transactional data are presented as an index and show total weekly till transactions at Pret shops as a proportion of their average weekly level in the first four weeks of 2020 (between Friday 3 January and Thursday 30 January 2020). Because of this comparison across the time series, users should expect an element of seasonality in the data.\nMore information on the areas featured is available in the\u00a0Measuring the data section.

The survey went out to 5,901 adults in Great Britain and had a response rate of 68% (4,004 responses). Further information to help understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain will be available in\u00a0Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain, due to be published on 22 October 2021.\nIn the period 6 to 17 October 2021, the proportion of working adults in Great Britain who in the past seven days:\ntravelled to work (both exclusively and in combination with working from home) increased by 3 percentage points from the previous period (22 September to 3 October 2021) to 70%\nworked exclusively from home remained broadly similar (15% in the latest period, 16% in the previous period)\nneither travelled to work nor worked from home decreased by 2 percentage points (15% in this period, 17% in the previous period)\nOf the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for food and medicine was broadly similar to the previous period at 81%.\nThe proportion of these adults who shopped for things other than food and medicine in the past seven days decreased by 2 percentage points from the previous period to 42%.\nOf the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so and reported wearing a face covering decreased by 4 percentage points from the previous period to 82%.\nFurther breakdowns such as the situation when a face covering was worn (for example, while shopping) and by country, will be available in\u00a0Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain,\u00a0due to be published on 22 October 2021.\nThese data series are experimental faster indicators for estimating UK spending on credit and debit cards. They track the daily CHAPS payments made by credit and debit card payment processors to around 100 major UK retail corporates. These payments are the proceeds of recent credit and debit card transactions made by customers at their stores, both via physical and via online platforms. More information on the indicator is provided in the accompanying\u202fmethodology article.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\nCompanies are allocated to one of four categories based on their primary business: \u202f\u00a0\u00a0\n\"staples\" refers to companies that sell essential goods that households need to purchase, such as food and utilities\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\n\"work-related\" refers to companies providing public transport or selling petrol\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\n\"delayable\" refers to companies selling goods whose purchase could be delayed, such as clothing or furnishings\n\"social\" refers to spending on travel and eating out\nFigure 7 shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors, \"merchant acquirers\".\u202f\u00a0\nIn the week to 14 October 2021, the CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases in aggregate decreased by 5 percentage points from the previous week to 97% of its February 2020 average level.

Weekly figures are available by\u202flocal authority and health board.\n", "id": 138}, {"document": "In England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) increased over the last two weeks, but the trend was uncertain in the week ending 1 December 2021; we estimate that 891,500 people in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 842,000 to 941,200), equating to around 1 in 60 people.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 appears stable over the most recent three weeks; we estimate that 60,300 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 49,400 to 71,200), equating to around 1 in 50 people in the week ending 1 December 2021.\nIn Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 increased over the last two weeks, but the trend was uncertain in the week ending 1 December 2021; we estimate that 39,300 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 30,600 to 49,000) equating to around 1 in 45 people.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 decreased in the week ending 2 December 2021; we estimate that 65,200 people in Scotland had COVID-19, (95% credible interval: 53,200 to 79,100) equating to around 1 in 80 people.\nTo date, we have identified a very small number of infections consistent with the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) among our survey participants, which is not sufficient to produce estimates at this time; we will continue to monitor this variant and will report estimates if the Omicron variant becomes more prevalent among the population.\nWithin this bulletin, we summarise some of the latest results from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. For more detailed information on our methods you can view our COVID-19 Infection Survey methodology article. You can also find out more about comparing methods used in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace in our article, to better understand comparisons in data sources.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the population living in private residential households. We exclude those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. In communal establishments, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nOur estimates are based on confirmed positive test results. The remaining swabs are either negative, which are included in our analysis, or are inconclusive, which are not included in our analysis. Some swabs are test failures, which are also not included in our analysis. We are working with the laboratories to understand consistency in the identification of inconclusive results, that could be weak positive results. The impact of this on our estimates of positive infections is likely to be very small and unlikely to affect the trend.\n\nMore information on COVID-19 and taking part in our survey  If you have any further questions, please email the CIS operations team:\u00a0COVID-19@ons.gov.uk.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nestimating the number of positive cases among the population living in private households, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between UK countries and different regions in England\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other communal establishments\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nBecause of the availability of test results, this week the reference week for England, Wales and Northern Ireland is 25 November to 1 December 2021. For Scotland, the reference week is 26 November to 2 December 2021.\nIn England and in Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) increased in the two weeks up to 1 December 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the seven days up to 1 December 2021. In Wales, the trend appeared stable in the three weeks up to 1 December 2021. In the week ending 2 December 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 decreased in Scotland.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wider and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are.\n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to fluctuate across regions in England. In the week ending 1 December 2021, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the South East and London. The percentage testing positive also increased in the North East in the two weeks up to 1 December 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. In the week ending 1 December 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the East Midlands, the West Midlands and the East of England. In the same week, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive was uncertain for the North West, the South West and Yorkshire and The Humber. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 also varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates for sub-regions of England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the week ending 1 December 2021 and sub-regions of Scotland in the week ending 2 December 2021.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"aged two years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to those aged 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 1 December 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) increased for those in school Year 7 to school Year 11, and for those aged 25 to 49 years. The percentage of people testing positive also increased for those aged two years to school Year 6 in the two weeks up to 1 December 2021, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. In the week ending 1 December 2021, the percentage testing positive decreased for those aged 50 years and over, while the trend was uncertain for those in school Year 12 to those aged 24 years.\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 was highest in school aged children: 4.18% (95% credible interval: 3.63% to 4.77%) of those aged two years to school Year 6 tested positive and 3.87% (95% credible interval: 3.33% to 4.41%) of those in school Years 7 to 11 tested positive in the week ending 1 December 2021.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following subsection and in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 21 October to 1 December 2021, and for Scotland from 22 October to 2 December 2021. These estimates are presented in Figure 5. These estimates are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis for England presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison to the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggests that positivity was highest in school-aged children. The trends were uncertain for all other age groups. Uncertainty is high for all ages in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in comparison to England because of comparatively smaller sample sizes, as indicated by wider confidence intervals. In Wales, the percentage testing positive continued to decrease for those of secondary school age and the trends were uncertain for all other ages. In Northern Ireland, the percentage testing positive continued to increase in recent weeks for those of secondary school age and appears to have continued to increase in those aged around 30 years and aged around 60 years. The trends were uncertain for all other ages. In Scotland, the trends were uncertain for all ages.\nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn the week ending 17 November 2021, the number of new PCR-positive coronavirus (COVID-19) cases increased in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the trend was uncertain in Wales. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish Cycle-threshold (Ct) values, which indicate viral load and act as a proxy for the strength of the virus. We also break down infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for Variants of Concern. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance. You can find out more in the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England briefing document (PDF, 2.51MB).\nUK Variants of Concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7\nBeta: B.1.351\nGamma: P.1\nDelta: B.1.617.2\nOmicron: B.1.1.529\nInfections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common since the end of May 2021 in England, and since the end of July 2021 in all four UK countries. Our most recent results show over 99% of all coronavirus (COVID-19) infections, from which we obtained a genetic sequence, were genetically compatible with the Delta variant or its descendants. Because these all have the same gene positivity pattern on our swab test, we have not included a breakdown of infections by variant based on gene positivity patterns. We last published our main variant analysis in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where you can find more details. We will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful. \nTo date, we have identified a very small number of infections consistent with the new Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) among our survey participants. It is only when we have sufficient participants testing positive with infections compatible with the Omicron variant that we can produce a meaningful estimate of the number of people infected in the population. We will continue to monitor this variant and other variants we detect in our sample. Please see our published statement explaining how we will detect this variant in our survey.\nOur Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our Understanding COVID-19 Variants blog. Our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article and our blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 infection survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a paper written by academic partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England  Dataset | Released 10 December 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland  Dataset | Released 10 December 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland  Dataset | Released 10 December 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales  Dataset | Released 10 December 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data  Dataset | Released 10 December 2021  Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency (UK HSA) and Wellcome Trust.

The average response rate in previous waves was approximately 23%. The Wave 47 response rate was lower than usual because of the Christmas period and the survey being live for a shorter period of time. This means that the estimates in this release are subject to more uncertainty than usual.\nFor questions regarding the last month, businesses were asked for their experience for the reference period 13 December 2021 to 9 January 2022, for questions regarding the last two weeks, businesses were asked for their experience for the reference period 13 December to 26 December 2021, although some businesses may have responded in relation to the point of completion of the questionnaire (29 December 2021 to 9 January 2022). This is consistent with previous waves of the survey.\nThese dates should be kept in mind in relation to coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance as the estimates could be affected by both the location of the business and the date on which the business responded.\nFor experimental single-site weighted regional estimates up to Wave 34 (28 June to 11 July 2021), please see Understanding the business impacts of local and national restrictions, UK: July 2021.\nIn early January 2022, just over 9 in 10 businesses (91%) were trading, with 77% fully trading and 14% partially trading. This compares with 81% fully trading and 11% partially trading in late December 2021.\nThe education (private sector and higher education businesses only) industry and the accommodation and food service activities industry both reported the lowest percentage of businesses trading, both fully and partially, at 84% in early January 2022.\nIn the accommodation and food service activities industry, the percentage of businesses currently trading decreased by 12 percentage points from late December 2021, driven by the food and beverage service activities sub-industry.\nIn the last month, nearly a third (32%) of all currently trading businesses reported to have experienced a decrease in turnover compared with normal expectations for this time of year. This compares with 30% reported the last time the question was asked, however, some of the industry-level effects are more pronounced, with the accommodation and food service activities industry reporting a 26-percentage point increase in reduced turnover during this period. \nOf businesses that reported a change in turnover in the last month, 53% reported the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as the main reason for change, while 12% reported a combination of the coronavirus pandemic and the end of the EU transition period as the main reason.\nIn early January 2022, the construction industry reported the highest proportion of businesses with no cash reserves, at 15%. \nTwo-fifths (40%) of all businesses reported having less than three months or no cash reserves, with the accommodation and food service activities industry reporting the highest percentage, at 54%. This industry also reported the highest percentage of low or no confidence to survive the next three months, at 17%.\nOf all businesses not permanently stopped trading, 7% reported they had low or no confidence they would survive the next three months, however, when excluding businesses with fewer than 10 employees this percentage reduced to 4%. In contrast, 84% reported having high or moderate confidence they would survive the next three months. This increased to 92% for businesses with 10 or more employees.\nIn late December 2021, approximately 3% of the workforce were estimated to be on sick leave or not working because of coronavirus symptoms, self-isolation or quarantine. This is the highest the figure has been since comparable estimates began in June 2020.\nThe other service activities industry, which includes hairdressing and other beauty treatments, reported the highest absence levels (7%) in late December 2021. The accommodation and food service activities industry also reported high absence levels (6%), driven by the accommodation sub-industry. These industries also saw the largest movement in percentages from early December 2021 to late December 2021, increasing by 5 and 4 percentage points respectively. \nApproximately 57% of the workforce were estimated to be working from a designated workspace (that is, not from home) in late December 2021. This estimate is down from 60% reported in early December 2021 and is also the lowest proportion reported since the response option was introduced in early October 2021. \nOf currently trading businesses, 9% had exported and 11% imported in the last 12 months and reported how their exporting or importing differed compared with normal expectations for this time of year. These businesses were asked about the challenges they had experienced with exporting or importing in the last month.\nOf currently trading businesses, 66% experienced a challenge with exporting and 79% with importing, in the last month. Changes in transportation costs and additional paperwork remain the top challenges for both exporting and importing. The manufacturing industry reported the highest percentage of businesses experiencing a challenge with additional paperwork (77%) and changes in transportation costs (70%) while exporting.\nOf all currently trading businesses that have imported, the accommodation and food service activities industry reported the highest percentage of businesses experiencing a challenge with changes in transportation costs, at 77%. \nOf the challenges documented, and for all currently trading businesses, the changes in transportation costs, finding information on how to import, and time taken for checks at the border reported the highest increases between late November and late December 2021, of 4 percentage points.\nFurther industry, size band and breakdowns of trade questions by type of export or import (goods, services or both) are available in the\u00a0accompanying dataset.

A detailed description of the methodology can be found.\nOf not permanently stopped trading businesses, 16% reported experiencing global supply chain disruption in the last month, while a third (33%) of all businesses reported no disruption. For businesses with 10 or more employees, these figures increased to 26% and 34% respectively. \nBusinesses not permanently stopped trading were asked if they had experienced changes to financial or operational activities in the last two weeks.\nNearly 1 in 10 (9%) reported that there were unexpected changes to financial or operational activities in late December 2021. The highest percentage was seen in the accommodation and food service activities industry, at 26%, followed by the transportation and storage industry, at 25%. For businesses with 10 or more employees, 12% reported experiencing unexpected changes to financial or operational activities.\nBusinesses not permanently stopped trading were also asked if they were expecting any financial or operational activities to be affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the next two weeks. Approximately one-quarter (25%) do expect activities to be affected whereas the remaining three-quarters do not expect financial or operational activities to be affected.\nAll industry breakdowns can be found in the accompanying dataset.\nBusinesses not permanently stopped trading were asked if they experienced a change in the number of cancellations from customers in the last month.\nThe other service activities industry, which includes hairdressing and other beauty treatments, had the highest proportion of businesses reporting increased cancellations in the last month, at 64%, a 14-percentage point increase from the month before.\nNearly half (44%) of businesses in the accommodation and food service activities industry reported an increase in cancellations. At sub-industry level, the accommodation sub-industry had 67% reporting they had experienced an increase in cancellations in the last month, compared with 41% in the food and beverage service activities sub-industry.\nBusinesses not permanently stopped trading were asked if they were using or intending to use safety measures in the workplace in early January 2022. The top three safety measures reported were:\u00a0\nhygiene measures (47%)\nsocial distancing (46%)\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) (41%)\nIn late December 2021, the UK reintroduced firmer restrictions on the use of PPE and social distancing in public settings. In early January 2022, the use of PPE was up 4 percentage points from late October 2021. The other service activities industry reported the highest percentage of businesses using PPE in early January 2022, at 80%.\nIn October 2021, some nations introduced customer coronavirus (COVID-19) checks. In Scotland, coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination certificates were introduced and in Wales, NHS COVID Passes were introduced. Of businesses not permanently stopped trading, 11% reported to be using or intending to use customer coronavirus (COVID-19) checks in early January 2022, up from 7% in late October 2021.\nBusinesses not permanently stopped trading and were using or intending to use one of the safety measures listed in the survey were also asked if the implementation for those measures affected their operating costs.\nMore than half (55%) of businesses reported that implementing safety measures had resulted in an increase in their operating costs, with 8% reporting costs increased substantially and 47% reporting costs had increased a little.\nThe top three industries where costs had increased substantially were the arts, entertainment and recreation industry (17%), the accommodation and food service activities industry (17%) and the construction industry (12%).\n\nBusiness insights and impact on the UK economy Dataset | Released 13 January 2022 Weighted estimates from the voluntary fortnightly Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) about financial performance, workforce, prices, trade, and business resilience.This dataset includes additional information collected as part of the survey not presented in this publication.These data are not\u00a0official statistics\u00a0but have been developed to deliver timely indicators to help understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other events in a timely way.Access to microdataThe BICS microdata for Waves 1 to 46 can now be accessed through the\u00a0Secure Research Service (SRS).

However, there are other factors such as the health status of individuals, changing infection levels, changing dominant variants and differing levels of immunity from prior infection that can influence the mortality rates.\nASMRs are therefore not equivalent to measures of vaccine effectiveness. More information on this can be found in our previous release.\nThe vaccination status is split by dose and time since vaccination, to allow for the increase in protection in the first few weeks after vaccination. We have updated our vaccination status definitions to include booster doses, defined as a third or booster dose received after 16 September 2021, the date from which booster doses were first administered. Therefore, vaccination status can be one of:\nunvaccinated\nreceived only the first dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived only the first dose, at least 21 days ago\nreceived only the first and second dose, less than 21 days ago\nreceived only the first and second dose, at least 21 days ago\nreceived a third dose, or booster, less than 21 days ago\nreceived a third dose, or booster, at least 21 days ago\nThis bulletin includes six-month and monthly ASMRs by vaccination status for deaths involving COVID-19, broken down by age group for the population in the Public Health Data Asset. More information on the dataset can be found in the Measuring the data section and our previous release. Annual data and ASMRs broken down by sex and age for deaths involving COVID-19, non-COVID-19 deaths and all deaths are provided in the datasets for all vaccination statuses, as well as counts of deaths by vaccination status for all registered deaths.\nIn the period July to December 2021, for people aged 10 years and over, the age-adjusted risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) was 93.4% lower for people who had received a third dose, or booster, at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people. For people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago, the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19 was 81.2% lower than for unvaccinated people. \nIn the period July to December 2021, the age-standardised mortality rates were significantly lower for people who had received a second or third dose, or booster, at least 21 days ago than unvaccinated people for all age groups. The mortality rates for people who had received the first dose were similar to unvaccinated people, particularly for older age groups. This was possibly because of the longer length of time when people had the first dose leading to waning protection from prior vaccination and also because of to the exclusion of people who had received a first and third dose, or booster, but not second dose from the analysis because of incomplete vaccination records (see Strengths and limitations).\nIn the period January to June 2021, for people aged 10 years and over, the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19 was 99.5% lower for people who had received a second dose at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people. The unvaccinated mortality rates for the period January to June were higher than the later period (July to December) for age groups over 60 years. This could be because, for example, of changes in the infection rates, particularly the high infection rates in January when most people were unvaccinated, changing dominant variants and changing levels of immunity from prior infection. \n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

This is also seen in the non-COVID-19 mortality rates (see datasets). This could be because of a change in composition of the people who have had a second dose, but not a third dose, or booster, similar to the effect seen in people who had the first dose at least 21 days ago discussed in our previous update.\nThese trends are broadly reflected in the data broken down by age. The mortality rates 21 days or more after a first dose are similar to those for unvaccinated people in older age groups. This could be because of people having had the first dose a long time ago and therefore now having limited protection, and the exclusion of people who had received a first and third dose, or booster, but not second dose from the analysis because of incomplete vaccination records (see Strengths and limitations).\nASMRs for non-COVID-19 deaths and all deaths are given in the datasets. These rates can be affected by composition effects such as the prioritisation of younger people with comorbidities for earlier vaccination than other people in their age group, and the poorer health of people who do not go on to receive subsequent vaccinations when eligible. These effects are discussed in our previous release.\n\nDeaths by vaccination status, England Dataset | Released 4 February 2022 Age-standardised mortality rates and age-specific mortality rates for deaths involving COVID-19, non-COVID-19 deaths and all deaths by vaccination status. \n\n\n", "summary": "Risk of COVID-19 death lowest among triple jabbed\nThe age-adjusted risk of death involving coronavirus (COVID-19) is consistently lower among those who have received at least three vaccines compared with unvaccinated people.\nThis is true for all age groups.\nIn England between July and December 2021, the mortality risk was 93.4% lower for people who had received a third dose, or booster at least 21 days ago compared with unvaccinated people.\nAmong people who had received their second dose at least 21 days ago, the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19 was 81.2% lower than those who were unvaccinated for the period July to December 2021.\nThe age-adjusted mortality rates are not equivalent to measures of vaccine effectiveness, which is reported in the COVID-19 Infection Survey.\n", "id": 190}, {"document": "To ensure our latest estimates are available at the earliest opportunity during this period of high infections of coronavirus (COVID-19), we will be publishing early\u00a0headline results\u00a0on Wednesdays.

We exclude those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. In communal establishments, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nOur estimates are based on confirmed positive test results. The remaining swabs are either negative, which are included in our analysis, or are inconclusive, which are not included in our analysis. Some swabs are test failures, which are also not included in our analysis. The impact of excluding inconclusive results on our estimates of positive infections is likely to be very small and unlikely to affect the trend.\n\nMore information on COVID-19 and taking part in our survey  If you have any further questions, please email the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey operations team: COVID-19@ons.gov.uk.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of positive cases among the population living in private households, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between UK countries and different regions in England\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other communal establishments\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nThe results in this bulletin are:\nIn this publication, the reference week for England, Wales and Northern Ireland is 6 to 12 February 2022, and the reference week for Scotland is 7 to 13 February 2022.\nIn England and Wales, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased in the week ending 12 February 2022. In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 increased in the two weeks up to 12 February 2022, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 increased in the two weeks up to 13 February 2022, but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. Our reported headline positivity estimates contain Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants and all other variants.\nAll estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Additionally, the estimates for the very latest days may change as more test results are received. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively smaller number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wider and results should be interpreted with caution. Wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nIn the week ending 12 February 2022, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) remained high across all regions of England. Trends have decreased in all regions except the South West where the trend was uncertain.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by region are available in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset, to provide an alternative measure over time, for context.\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared with one another. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is more uncertainty in sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 varied across sub-regions of the UK. Figure 3 presents modelled estimates for sub-regions of all UK countries in the week ending 12 February 2022 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and week ending 13 February 2022 for Scotland.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"aged 2 years to school Year 6\" includes children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to those aged 24 years\" includes young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThose aged 11 to 12 years and those aged 16 to 17 years have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 12 February 2022, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased across all age groups except those aged 50 to 69 years, where the trend was uncertain.\nIn the week ending 12 February 2022, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 varied substantially across age groups, remaining highest for those aged 2 years to school Year 6 at 7.60% (95% credible interval: 6.89% to 8.35%) and lowest for those aged 70 years and over at 2.23% (95% credible interval: 2.03% to 2.45%).\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following section and the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nIn this section, we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19. These estimates are by single year of age over time from 2 January to 12 February 2022 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and from 3 January to 13 February 2022 for Scotland. They are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis for England presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison with the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggests that the percentage of young adults and children testing positive decreased in recent weeks. In Wales, the percentage testing positive decreased across all ages except those in older age groups, where trends were uncertain in recent weeks. In Northern Ireland, the percentage testing positive increased in those aged over 40 years, while the trends were uncertain in those aged under 40 years in recent weeks. In Scotland, the trends in the percentage testing positive were uncertain across all ages in recent weeks.\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\nThe\u00a0incidence rate\u00a0is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases per day per 10,000 people in a given time period. In this section, we look at an earlier time period to our percentage testing positive analysis. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and in Table 2.\nIn the week ending 29 January 2022, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per day increased across all UK countries. Credible intervals\u00a0are wider for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland because of relatively smaller sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nEach week, we publish\u00a0Cycle-threshold (Ct) values and we also break down infections by variant, based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests.\nThe \"Cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value, is used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. The Ct values of coronavirus (COVID-19) positive tests are provided in the\u00a0technical dataset\u00a0for this bulletin.\nThe Omicron variant currently dominant in England, Wales and Scotland is BA.1. This variant has changes in one of the three genes that the coronavirus swab test used in the survey detects, known as the S-gene, which means the S-gene is no longer detected by the current test. When there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious), absence of the S-gene in combination with the presence of the other two genes (ORF1ab and N-genes) is a reliable indicator of this Omicron BA.1 variant. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), the absence of the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of this Omicron variant. The sub-variant Omicron BA.1.1 also mostly has gene pattern ORF1ab + N. Therefore, gene pattern matching used in our main variant analysis cannot distinguish between Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.1.1.\nThe Omicron variant BA.2 does not have changes in the S-gene, and therefore all three genes, or the S-gene and either ORF1ab or N, will usually be detected in infections with this variant. Delta also does not have changes in the S-gene, and therefore the same sets of genes will usually be detected with Delta and Omicron BA.2. However, our genome sequencing analysis shows that a clear majority of cases where we detect the S-gene are now Omicron BA.2, with relatively few being Delta. For this reason, we now label cases with gene patterns ORF1ab + N + S, ORF1ab + S and N + S as \"compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant\" in our main variant analysis. This is because estimates are now likely to mostly reflect trends in BA.2, although Delta may still be having a very small impact. The Omicron variant BA.2 is now the most common in Northern Ireland.\nThe most recent week shows that 86.2% of all sequenced COVID-19 infections from the survey were compatible with the Omicron BA.1 variant or its sub-variants, and 13.7% were compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant. Our latest complete sequenced data lags our main variant analysis and these percentages are an average over a whole week to 6 February 2022.\nOur main variant analysis is for a reference day, and therefore is not directly comparable with the sequencing data.\nThe following analysis looks at the percentage of the population with a positive test compatible with the Omicron BA.1 variant or with the Omicron BA.2 variant in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the regions of England.\nDuring periods of change in COVID-19 variants we will include a breakdown of estimated infections by variant to illustrate how the estimated percentage of people infected in the population is changing by variant (Figure 6). When nearly all infections are compatible with a dominant variant, we will no longer include this breakdown.\n\n!\n\nData should be treated with caution. In particular, there could be small numbers of positive cases compatible with a particular variant in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, leading to considerable uncertainty surrounding these estimates. There are further uncertainties given that not all cases that are positive on the ORF1ab and N-genes will be the Omicron BA.1 variant, and not all cases that have a detectable S gene will be the Omicron BA.2 variant. \n\n\n\nIn this publication, the reference week for England, Wales and Northern Ireland is 6 to 12 February 2022, and the reference week for Scotland is 7 to 13 February 2022.\nIn the most recent week, the percentage of cases compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant increased across all UK countries, while the percentage of cases compatible with the Omicron BA.1 variant decreased across all UK countries.\nIn the week ending 12 February 2022, the percentage of cases compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant increased in all regions of England except the North East, where the trend was uncertain. In the same week, the percentage of cases compatible with the Omicron BA.1 variant decreased in all regions of England. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for variants of concern. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance. You can find out more in the latest\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England briefing document.\nUK variants of concern:\nAlpha: B.1.1.7\nBeta: B.1.351\nGamma: P.1\nDelta: B.1.617.2 and its genetic descendants\nOmicron: B.1.1.529 (which includes sublineages BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3)\nOur Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0contains several tables relating to analysis on variants, including the genetic lineages of the virus seen in the samples we sequence. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 variants blog. Our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr Tanya Golubchik and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low -- under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the COVID-19 Infection Survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 18 February 2022 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 18 February 2022 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 18 February 2022 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 18 February 2022 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 18 February 2022 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

COVID-19 was not one of the top three leading causes of death for care home residents in the third wave.\nIn both England and Wales, the mean number of pre-existing conditions did not change substantially over the three waves, with Dementia and Alzheimer disease being the most common in both male and female care home residents.\nFor the purposes of this release, using death registration data, the waves (see Glossary) of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic have been defined as:\nfirst wave: deaths registered from 14 March to 11 September 2020\nsecond wave: deaths registered from 12 September 2020 to 11 June 2021\nthird wave: deaths registered from 12 June 2021 to 21 January 2022\nThe first, second and third waves constitute 26, 39, and 32 weeks respectively. Therefore, we have calculated proportions to allow comparisons across waves.\n\"Deaths of care home residents\" refers to both (a) deaths occurring in a care home to residents, and (b) deaths where the deceased resided in a care home but died elsewhere. The figures should not be confused with \"deaths in care homes\" reported in other publications, which refers only to category (a).\nThe term \"due to COVID-19\" refers to deaths with an underlying cause of death as COVID-19. The term \"involving COVID-19\" refers to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate.\nBetween the week ending 20 March 2020 and the week ending 21 January 2022, 274,063 deaths of care home residents were registered in England and Wales. Of these, 45,632 involved COVID-19, accounting for 16.7% of all deaths of care home residents. \nUpdated data on place of death, geography and personal characteristics (age and sex) are available in the accompanying dataset.\nOf the 260,349 deaths registered in England across all waves of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, 32.8% of deaths were registered during the first wave (85,305 deaths), 38.2% were registered during the second wave (99,380 deaths), and 29.1% were registered during the third wave (75,664 deaths). \nAcross all waves, there were 43,256 mentions of \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d (COVID-19) anywhere on the death certificate, accounting for 16.6% of all care home resident deaths in England. The sharpest rise in deaths involving COVID-19 was registered in the first wave (Figure 1), which was the wave that had the highest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 (19,783 deaths, 23.2%). In the second wave, 20.9% of care home resident deaths involved COVID-19 (20,766 deaths) compared with a steep drop in the third wave, with 3.6% of all deaths involving COVID-19 (2,707 deaths). \nThere is evidence of a period of mortality displacement (see Glossary) following the peak of the second wave in England (week ending 29 January 2021, 4,599 deaths), as the weekly total deaths from the week ending 19 February 2021 to the week ending 16 July 2021 are all below the five-year average (Figure 1). Following this period of mortality displacement, deaths more closely align to the weekly five-year average during the third wave. \nOverall, total deaths of care home residents in England were 8.4% higher than the five-year average across all waves (20,268 excess deaths; see Glossary). Total deaths were 43.9% higher than the five-year average for the first wave (26,035 excess deaths), 3.1% lower for the second wave (3,200 deaths below average) and 3.3% lower for the third wave (2,567 deaths below average). \nOf the 13,630 deaths registered in Wales across all waves of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, 30.8% of deaths were registered during the first wave (4,196 deaths), 40.0% were registered during the second wave (5,454 deaths), and 29.2% were registered during the third wave (3,980 deaths). \nAcross all waves, there were 2,367 mentions of \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d (COVID-19) anywhere on the death certificate, accounting for 17.4% of all care home resident deaths in Wales. While the sharpest rise in deaths involving COVID-19 were registered in the first wave (20.9%, 876 deaths), there was a higher proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in the second wave (23.8%, 1,297 deaths). The third wave had the lowest proportion (4.9%) of deaths involving COVID-19 (194 deaths). \nOverall, total deaths of care home residents in Wales were 5.9% higher than the five-year average across all waves (756 excess deaths; see Glossary). Total deaths were 33.2% higher than the five-year average for the first wave (1,046 excess deaths), 1.8% lower for the second wave (100 deaths below average) and 4.6% lower for the third wave (190 deaths below average). \nBoth England and Wales experienced excess deaths in care home residents in the first wave of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, but not in the second or third waves (Figures 2 and 4). There are several possible reasons for this, including:\nvulnerability of the care home resident population because of their age, health and susceptibility to viruses\nincreased care support packages and introduction of the local COVID-19 alert levels system later during the pandemic\n\u201cmortality displacement\u201d where the higher number of deaths registered in the first wave and peak of the second wave could be contributing to the lower deaths registered later in the second wave and the third wave\nlower levels of care home occupancy in the second wave; possible reasons for this could include the care home population not yet having returned to normal after a greater number of deaths earlier in the year, care homes limiting capacity because of social distancing measures, and a delay in individuals moving into care homes because of perceived risk of infection\navailability of COVID-19 vaccinations, including boosters in the third wave, for which care home residents were a prioritised group\nThe Office for National Statistics\u2019 leading causes of death groupings are based on a list developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This categorises causes of death using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) into groups that are epidemiologically more meaningful than single ICD-10 codes, for the purpose of comparing the most common causes of death in the population. \nCoronavirus (COVID-19) was the leading cause of death in male care home residents in England in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic accounting for 24.8% of deaths. This dropped to the second leading cause in the second wave (19.2% of deaths) and the eighth leading cause in the third wave (3.3% of deaths). \nDementia and Alzheimer disease remained the leading cause of death for female care home residents in all three waves accounting for 32.6%, 31.9% and 37.3% of deaths respectively. COVID-19 was the second leading cause of death in the first and second waves for female care home residents (19.6% and 17.9% of deaths respectively) and this dropped to the sixth leading cause in the third wave (2.5% of deaths). \nIn England, the three highest leading causes of death in the third wave are aligned with pre-coronavirus pandemic conditions for both male and female care home residents. \nIn Wales, Dementia and Alzheimer disease remained the leading cause of death across all three waves for both male (25.2%, 24.3%, and 32.1% respectively) and female care home residents (34.2%, 32.7% and 39.7% respectively). \nCOVID-19 was the second leading cause of death in both male and female care home residents in the first wave (23.1% and 17.0% respectively) and the second wave (23.7% and 19.6% respectively). In the third wave, COVID-19 dropped to the fourth leading cause of death in both male (5.1%) and female (3.7%) care home residents. \nThe full list of leading causes broken down by sex, for both England and Wales, are included in the accompanying dataset. \nWe analysed pre-existing conditions (see Glossary) where coronavirus (COVID-19) was the underlying cause of death among care home residents. A death record can list up to 15 pre-existing conditions so the total number of pre-existing conditions may be higher than the total for deaths. For more detail, please see Measuring pre-existing health conditions in death certification - deaths involving COVID-19. For this analysis data for pre-existing conditions is based on deaths registered between 14 March 2020 and 31 December 2021 as pre-existing condition data for 2022 have not been analysed.\nIn England, of the care home resident deaths where COVID-19 was the underlying cause up until week ending 31 December 2021 (38,296 deaths), 86.6% (33,161 care home residents) had at least one pre-existing condition (86.7% first wave, 86.6% second wave, and 85.1% third wave). The mean number of pre-existing conditions of care home residents was 1.7 in the first and second waves, and 1.8 in the third wave. The three most common pre-existing conditions did not change across the waves for male or female care home residents. \nIn Wales, of the care home resident deaths where COVID-19 was the underlying cause up until week ending 31 December 2021 (2,077 deaths), 81.3% (1,688 care home residents) had at least one pre-existing condition (78.1% first wave, 83.8% second wave, and 78.2% third wave). The mean number of pre-existing conditions of care home residents was 1.4 in the first and second waves, and 1.5 in the third wave. \nThe breakdowns by sex and wave for the ten most common pre-existing conditions in deaths due to COVID-19 are available in the accompanying dataset.\n\nDeaths involving COVID-19 in the care sector, England and Wales Dataset | Released 28 February 2022 Provisional counts of the number of deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) within the care sector registered from 14 March 2020 to 21 January 2022. \n\n\nMore quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in the Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI. The counts of deaths from specific conditions are updated with each weekly deaths publication as the coding of the underlying cause is not always complete at the time of production. The doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death.\nThe information used to produce these statistics is based on details collected when certified deaths are registered with the local registration office. Our statistics are based on what the doctor writes on the death certificate. Doctors use their professional knowledge and judgement to decide what caused or contributed to the death. Their opinion does not have to be based on test results. Using this information, we determine an underlying cause of death. More information on this process can be found in our User guide to mortality statistics.\nFigures on deaths published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) differ from those produced by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the UK's public health agencies. Our blog\u202f Counting deaths involving COVID-19 helps to explain the differences.\nIn England and Wales, deaths should be registered within five days of the death occurring, but there are some situations that result in the registration of the death being delayed. For example, when a death needs to be investigated by a coroner. More information on this issue can be found in our impact of registration delays release.\nThere have been fluctuations in occupancy rates in care homes because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, therefore we have been unable to accurately estimate a care home resident population during this time period; because of this, mortality rates have not been calculated for this publication.\nFinal death registrations have been used for 2020 data up to week 52 (week ending 25 December 2020). From week 53 2020 (week ending 1 January 2021), including all of 2021 and 2022, data are provisional. As the data are provisional, they are subject to change. Therefore, numbers reported in previous releases may be different to the numbers reported here.\nFor finalised 2020 data, we used the communal establishment file we used for our previous release. We have used the most up-to-date communal establishment file we have for 2021 and 2022 data. Therefore, there is some potential for under- and over-coverage within the figures provided. \nWhere we refer to the five-year average, this is based on the actual number of death registrations recorded for the corresponding time period in the years:\n2015 to 2019; for 2020 and 2021 figures\n2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021; for 2022 figures\nThe year 2020 has been excluded from the five-year average calculations because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on deaths registered in that year. Please see our blog Understanding excess deaths during a pandemic for further information. \nThere are some differences in death statistics between countries of the UK, but these are believed to have a negligible impact on comparability.\nDeaths involving COVID-19, including those in the care sector, are reported for each week in our Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional release.\nOur User guide to mortality statistics provides further information on data quality, legislation and procedures relating to mortality and includes a glossary of terms.\n", "summary": "16.7% of care resident deaths have involved COVID-19 since March 2020\nSince the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, of the 274,063 deaths to care home residents in England and Wales, 45,632 (16.7%) involved COVID-19.\nThere were more total deaths of care home residents compared to the five-year average in the first wave of the pandemic with 26,035 excess deaths in England and 1,046 excess deaths in Wales. In the second and third waves, however, total deaths fell below the five-year average.\nIn England, total deaths of care home residents increased by 16.5% between the first and second waves with 85,305 and 99,380 deaths respectively. Following this, deaths decreased by 23.9% between the second and third waves (75,664) deaths. The proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 was highest in the first wave (23.2%) and lowest in the third wave (3.6%).\nIn Wales, total deaths of care home residents in Wales increased by 30.0% between the first and second waves with 4,196 and 5,454 deaths respectively. It decreased by 27.0% between the second and third waves (3,980 deaths).

For more detailed information on our methods see our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey methodology article.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the population living in private residential households. We exclude those in hospitals, care homes and/or other communal establishments. In communal establishments, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the COVID-19 pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new PCR positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nOur estimates are based on confirmed positive test results. The remaining swabs are either negative, which are included in our analysis, or are inconclusive, which are not included in our analysis. Some swabs are test failures, which are also not included in our analysis. The impact of excluding inconclusive results on our estimates of positive infections is likely to be very small and unlikely to affect the trend.\n\nMore about coronavirus  Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of positive cases among the population living in private households, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between UK countries and different regions in England\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other communal establishments\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nThe results in this bulletin are:\nprovisional and subject to revision\nbased on infections occurring in private households\nsubject to uncertainty, a credible or confidence interval gives an indication of the uncertainty of an estimate from data analysis\nIn England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) remained high in the week ending 2 April 2022. In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 continued to increase in the week ending 2 April 2022, while the trend was uncertain in Northern Ireland in the same week. In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 decreased in the week ending 3 April 2022. Our estimates contain Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants and all other variants.\nAll estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Additionally, the estimates for the very latest days may change as more test results are received. Therefore, our official estimates for a particular week are based on a reference day a few days before the end of the week and caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the very latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of a relatively smaller number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in the sample, credible intervals are wider, and results should be interpreted with caution. Wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the approaches used.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods, which underpin our modelled official estimates, and the unweighted sample counts are also included in the associated datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and\u00a0Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nIn the week ending 2 April 2022, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) varied across regions in England. The percentage of people testing positive increased in the East Midlands, North East, North West and Yorkshire and The Humber. In the West Midlands, East of England, London and the South West, the percentage testing positive increased over the most recent two weeks, however the trend was uncertain in the most recent week.\u00a0In the week ending 2 April 2022, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus decreased in the South East.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for COVID-19 was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by region are available in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline national estimates and should not be compared. The number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive is lower compared with the number testing positive in their respective national samples. This means there is more uncertainty in sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 varied across sub-regions of the UK. Figure 3 presents modelled estimates for sub-regions of all UK countries in the week ending 2 April 2022 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and in the week ending 3 April 2022 for Scotland.\nOur\u00a0age groups\u00a0separate children and young people by school age.\nIn the week ending 2 April 2022, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in England increased in those in School Year 12 to those aged 34 years and in those aged 70 years and over. For those aged 50 to 69 years, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 in England increased in the two weeks up to 2 April 2022, however the trend was uncertain in the most recent week. For age groups 2 years to School Year 6 and those aged 35 to 49 years, the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 in England decreased, while the trend was uncertain for those in School Year 7 to School Year 11.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England dataset. \n\n\n\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age are available in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. However, estimates on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model are in the following section and\u00a0accompanying datasets.\nIn this section, we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time from 20 February to 2 April 2022 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and from 21 February to 3 April 2022 for Scotland. They are produced using a different method to the grouped age analysis for England presented previously and are therefore not comparable. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group in comparison with the total sample size for each country. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger confidence intervals. These can be found in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets. \n\n\n\nThe data presented in Figure 5 for England suggests that the percentage of people testing positive varied across age groups in the most recent week. \u00a0\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive increased in the older age groups, while the trend was uncertain in school-aged children and young adults in the most recent week. \u00a0\nIn Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive increased in those aged over 60 years but decreased in school-aged children and young adults in the most recent week.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in school-aged children and young adults, while the trend was uncertain in the older age groups in the most recent week.\nFurther analysis on age for\u00a0Wales,\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Scotland\u00a0is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in\u00a0English\u00a0and\u00a0Welsh.\nThe\u00a0incidence rate\u00a0is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases per day per 10,000 people in a given time period. In this section, we look at an earlier time period to our analysis of the percentage testing positive. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets\u00a0and in Table 2.\nIn the week ending 19 March 2022, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per day continued to increase in England, Wales and Scotland. In the same week, the trend in the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases per day was uncertain in Northern Ireland.\u00a0Credible intervals\u00a0are wider for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland because of relatively smaller sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days before the positivity reference day, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nWe publish \u00a0Cycle-threshold (Ct) values\u00a0and a breakdown of infections by variant, based on gene positivity patterns from our swab tests. The \"Cycle threshold\", known as a Ct value, is a proxy for the quantity of virus (also known as viral load), where a lower Ct value indicates higher viral load. The latest Ct values of coronavirus (COVID-19) positive tests are provided in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset.\nThe Omicron variant BA.1 has changes in one of the three genes that the coronavirus survey swab test detects, which means the S-gene is no longer detected. When there is a high viral load (for example, when a person is most infectious), not detecting the S-gene in combination with detecting the other two genes (ORF1ab and N-genes) is a reliable indicator of this Omicron BA.1 variant. However, as the viral load decreases (for example, if someone is near the end of their recovery from the infection), not detecting the S-gene is a less reliable indicator of this Omicron variant.\nThe Omicron variant BA.2 does not have changes in the S-gene, and therefore all three genes, or the S-gene and either ORF1ab or N, will usually be detected in infections with this variant.\nOur latest complete sequenced data were last updated the week ending 20 March 2022 and showed that the Omicron BA.2 variant remained the most common variant in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. In that week, 89.8% of all sequenced COVID-19 infections from the survey were compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant, and 10.2% were compatible with the Omicron BA.1 variant or its sub-variants.\nOur main variant analysis is for a reference day, and therefore is not directly comparable with the sequencing data. The following analysis looks at the percentage of the population with a positive test compatible with the Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 variant in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the regions of England.\nDuring periods of change in COVID-19 variants we will include a breakdown of estimated infections by variant to illustrate how the estimated percentage of people infected in the population is changing by variant (Figure 6). When nearly all infections are compatible with a dominant variant, we will no longer include this breakdown.\n\n!\n\nData should be treated with caution. There could be small numbers of positive cases compatible with a particular variant in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, leading to considerable uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Not all cases that are positive on the ORF1ab and N-genes will be the Omicron BA.1 variant, and not all cases that have a detectable S-gene will be the Omicron BA.2 variant. \n\n\n\nThe percentage of people with infections compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant remained high in England, continued to increase in Wales and the trend was uncertain in Northern Ireland and Scotland in the week ending 3 April 2022.\nIn the same week, the percentage of people with infections compatible with the Omicron BA.1 variant decreased in England and Scotland but showed possible signs of an increase in Wales. In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people with infections compatible with the Omicron BA.1 variant was uncertain in the most recent week.\nIn the week ending 2 April 2022, the percentage of people with infections compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant increased in the East Midlands, North East, North West and Yorkshire and The Humber. In the same week, the percentage of people with infections compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant decreased in the South East. The trend in the percentage of people with infections compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant was uncertain in the West Midlands, East of England, South West, and London in the most recent week.\nIn the same week, the percentage of people with infections compatible with the Omicron BA.1 variant decreased in the East Midlands, East of England, London, South East and the South West, while the trend was uncertain in the North East, North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and West Midlands. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend. These modelled estimates can be found in the\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey datasets.\nThe\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for variants of concern. These are variants that the UK government has under surveillance. You can find out more in the latest\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England briefing document.\nCurrently circulating variants of concern in the UK are:\nDelta: B.1.617.2 and its genetic descendants\nOmicron: B.1.1.529 (which includes sublineages BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3)\nOur\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical dataset\u00a0includes analysis of the genetic lineages of coronavirus seen in the samples we sequence. More information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0Understanding COVID-19 variants blog. Our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey methods article\u00a0gives more detail about how we sequence the virus' genetic material.\nThe sequencing is produced by Northumbria University and analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr Tanya Golubchik and Dr Helen Fryer. Genome sequencing is funded by the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. COG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), and Genome Research Limited operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey methods article\u00a0and our\u00a0blog that explains why we trust the data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England Dataset | Released 8 April 2022 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland Dataset | Released 8 April 2022 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland Dataset | Released 8 April 2022 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales Dataset | Released 8 April 2022 Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data Dataset | Released 8 April 2022 Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency (UK HSA) and Wellcome Trust.

The accompanying datasets also include mortality rates for deaths due to COVID-19 by local area (up to November 2020) and deprivation, and deaths involving COVID-19 for the UK. \n\n\n\nBased on provisional data, there were 52,676 deaths registered in England in December 2020. This was 8,390 more deaths than in December 2019 and 10,594 deaths more than the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Of the deaths registered in December 2020, 26,981 were males and 25,695 were females.\nIn Wales, the provisional number of deaths registered in December 2020 was 3, 941. This was 851 more deaths than in December 2019 and 1,075 more deaths than the five-year average for December. Of the deaths registered in December in Wales, there were 2,047 male deaths and 1,894 female deaths.\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) are used for comparisons over time rather than numbers of deaths, as ASMRs account for changes to the population size and age structure. In England, December 2003 was the year with the highest mortality rate since our data time series began in 2001. Since then, mortality rates in England for the month of December had been generally decreasing from 1,407.6 deaths per 100,000 people in 2003, to a low of 853.7 deaths per 100,000 people in December 2018. The statistically significant decrease in age-standardised mortality rates from 2003 was seen in both males and females (Figure 1). But since 2018, the mortality rate has increased each year.\nIn England, the December 2020 mortality rate (1,123.6 deaths per 100,000 people) was significantly higher than the mortality rate in every year back to December 2010 (1,151.2 deaths per 100,000 people) but remained significantly lower than December 2003 (the highest mortality rate in this analysis; 1,407.6 deaths per 100,000 people). The mortality rate in December 2020 was 1,339.8 deaths per 100,000 males (compared with 1,674.7 in December 2003) and 950.4 deaths per 100,000 females (compared with 1,217.4 in December 2003).\nIn Wales, 2003 was also the year with the highest December mortality rate since our data time series began in 2001. Over time, mortality rates in Wales have decreased from 1,470.3 deaths per 100,000 people in December 2003 to a low of 976.3 deaths per 100,000 people in December 2018. Since 2018, the December mortality rate for Wales has increased each year. In December 2020, the mortality rate significantly increased (compared with December 2019) to 1,373.9 deaths per 100,000 people; this increase was seen in both males and females. The December 2020 mortality rate was significantly higher than the mortality rate in every year back to December 2008, and was only significantly lower than December 2003 (the highest December mortality rate in our data time series).\nThe doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death. Using this information, we determine an underlying cause of death. More information on this process can be found in our\u00a0user guide. In most cases (90.2% in England and 88.2% in Wales) where the coronavirus (COVID-19) was mentioned on the death certificate, it was found to be the underlying cause of death. For more information on our definition of COVID-19 deaths, see Section 10: Measuring the data.\n\n!\n\nIn this bulletin, we use the term \u201cdue to COVID-19\u201d when referring only to deaths with an underlying cause of death of COVID-19 and we use the term \u201cinvolving COVID-19\u201d when referring to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether as an underlying cause or not. \n\n\n\nOf the 52,676 deaths registered in December 2020 in England, 20.8% (10,973 deaths) were due to COVID-19. This is the highest proportion seen in England since May 2020 (when 23.1% of all deaths were due to COVID-19). Taking into account all deaths involving COVID-19 increases the percentage to 24.3% of all deaths (12,797 deaths) in England in December 2020. \nIn Wales, 27.4% of the 3,941 deaths registered in December 2020 were due to COVID-19 (1,081 deaths), the highest proportion seen in Wales since April 2020 (when 30.1% of all deaths were due to COVID-19). Taking into account all deaths involving COVID-19 increases the percentage to 31.3% of all deaths (1,233 deaths) in Wales. \nWhen adjusting for the size and age structure of the population, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths due to COVID-19 in both England and Wales have increased significantly each month between October and December 2020 (Figure 2). In England, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly increased for the fourth consecutive month, with a rate of 233.6 deaths per 100,000 people in December 2020 due to COVID-19. In Wales, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly increased for the third consecutive month, with a rate of 374.4 deaths per 100,000 people in December 2020. The rate of deaths due to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Wales than in England, also for the third consecutive month.\nAlthough mortality rates due to COVID-19 have increased between October and December 2020, these remain significantly lower than in April 2020 (when both England and Wales experienced the highest COVID-19 mortality rates). In England, the ASMR due to COVID-19 in December 2020 was 62.5% lower than in April 2020 (623.2 deaths per 100,000 people). In Wales, the ASMR due to COVID-19 in December 2020 was 24.4% lower than in April 2020 (495.1 deaths per 100,000 people).\nSuper Output Areas (SOAs) are small-area statistical geographies covering England and Wales. Each area has a similarly sized population and remains stable over time. For this analysis, Middle layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) have been used. The\u00a0accompanying dataset\u00a0shows the number of deaths from all causes as well as deaths due to COVID-19.\nThe following interactive map allows you to see the cumulative number of monthly deaths due to COVID-19 in each area.\nDownload the data\nOur\u00a0leading causes of death groupings\u00a0are based on a list developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This categorises causes of death using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) into groups that are epidemiologically more meaningful than single ICD-10 codes, for the purpose of comparing the most common causes of death in the population.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the 10 most common underlying causes of death registered in December 2020 for England and Wales, compared with the five-year average for December (2015 to 2019).\nIn both England and Wales, the coronavirus (COVID-19) was the leading cause of death in December 2020, with 233.6 deaths per 100,000 people in England (10,973 deaths) and 374.4 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales (1,081 deaths). This was the second consecutive month where COVID-19 was the leading cause of death. Prior to November and December 2020, COVID-19 had not been the leading cause of death since May 2020.\nThe rate of deaths due to COVID-19 was significantly higher than the next leading cause of death in both England and Wales. In both countries, the second most common cause of death in December 2020 was dementia and Alzheimer's disease, with 112.0 deaths per 100,000 people in England (5,281 deaths) and 121.2 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales (346 deaths). The COVID-19 mortality rate was around double the second leading cause of death in England, and almost triple the second leading cause of death in Wales.\nIn England in December 2020, 6 of the 10 leading causes of death were significantly lower than the five-year average (2015 to 2019), with only the signs, symptoms and ill-defined conditions; Malignant neoplasm of colon, sigmoid, rectum and anus; and malignant neoplasm of prostate categories having similar mortality rates to the five-year average. In Wales, 7 of the 10 leading causes were similar to the five-year average, with only influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases having significantly lower mortality rates.\nBased on provisional data, the leading cause of death in 2020 in both England and Wales was COVID-19, accounting for 12.1% of all deaths in England and 11.7% of all deaths in Wales. Dementia and Alzheimer's disease was the second most common cause of death in both England (11.6% of all deaths) and Wales (10.4% of all deaths).\nIn both countries, the rate of deaths from dementia and Alzheimer's disease in 2020 was similar to the level of deaths expected, based on the five-year average (2015 to 2019). More information on provisional leading causes of death for January to December 2020 is available in Tables 11a and 11b of the accompanying dataset. More in-depth, annual analysis of leading causes of death is available for the\u00a0UK\u00a0(2001 to 2018) and\u00a0England and Wales (2019). Analysis of finalised data for 2020, including more detailed breakdowns of the leading causes of death by age and sex, will be published later this year.\nGenerally since 2001 (the beginning of our data time series), the age-standardised mortality rates for people aged both 0 to 74 years and 75 years and over have been decreasing in England and Wales. However, similar to the trend seen in all ages (Section 2), mortality rates in both England and Wales have increased in 2019 and 2020 for both age groups. More information on mortality rates by sex and age group (including age-specific mortality rates by five-year age group for people aged 75 years and over) is available in Tables 5 to 9 of the accompanying dataset.\nAmong usual residents, there were 569,770 deaths registered in England and 37,403 in Wales in 2020 (January to December). We have analysed how deaths registered in 2020 compared with previous years in a recent blog post. Please note that the figures in this blog also include the deaths of non-residents (829 deaths registered in 2020), so differ from the numbers reported in this bulletin.\nTo gain a better idea of year-to-year differences in mortality rates, we calculate year-to-date age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) each month. In the December edition, our year-to-date analysis covers deaths registered between 1 January and 31 December in each year from 2001 to 2020 (Figure 8).\nFor England, the provisional ASMR for 2020 was 1,037.4 deaths per 100,000 people, which was statistically significantly higher than all years between 2009 and 2019. For Wales, the provisional ASMR for 2020 was 1,112.7 deaths per 100,000 people, which was significantly higher than all years between 2010 and 2019.\nThis section is based on the date a death occurred \u2013 rather than the date of registration used in the previous sections \u2013 to monitor current mortality trends. Analysis of deaths by date of registration is useful as the figures are comparable across time and geography. Because of the length of time that it takes a death to be registered, using data based on registration can mean that we are not monitoring the most current death trends. For example, a death registered in December 2020 could have occurred in a previous month or even a previous year. Further information regarding death occurrences and registration delays can be found in\u00a0Section 10: Measuring the data.\nBetween 1 January and 31 December 2020, 550,238 deaths occurred in England (and were registered by 9 January 2021). This was 50,882 more deaths than the five-year average (2015 to 2019) for January to December (10.2% higher). Of the 550,238 deaths that occurred, 12.9% were due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) (71,110 deaths).\nIn Wales, 36,308 deaths occurred in 2020 (and were registered by 9 January 2021), which was 2,794 more deaths than the five-year average (8.3% higher). COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death in 12.5% of all deaths that occurred (4,532 deaths).\nIn England, the first death due to COVID-19 occurred on 30 January 2020 (Figure 9). Since 11 March, the number of COVID-19 deaths occurring on each day rose (except for 6 April 2020, when it decreased by 12 deaths) until the peak of 1,228 deaths that occurred on 8 April 2020. Since 8 April, the number of COVID-19 deaths each day had been decreasing, but began increasing again from mid-September. The number of daily COVID-19 deaths has continued to increase throughout October, November and December, reaching 462 deaths on 27 December (the highest since 7 May at 487 deaths). The number of death occurrences on more recent dates are likely to rise as we receive more death registrations.\nIn Wales, the first death with an underlying cause of COVID-19 occurred on 15 March. As in England, the number of COVID-19 deaths per day reached the peak on 8 April 2020, when 70 deaths due to COVID-19 occurred in Wales. Since 8 April, the number of COVID-19 deaths occurring each day in Wales had been gradually decreasing, with no COVID-19 deaths occurring on 41 days between June and September. However, daily COVID-19 deaths increased throughout October, November and December, with 56 deaths occurring on 18 December 2020 (though this may be higher due to registrations delays). This is the highest number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 in Wales since 17 April 2020 (58 deaths due to COVID-19).\nIt is important to note that the number of death occurrences is incomplete as it is likely that more deaths need to be registered, therefore comparisons should be treated with caution.\nIn particular, instances where the number of death occurrences on each day in December was below the range of the last five years are likely to be a result of when the data extract was created, as deaths that occurred towards the end of the month may not have been registered by that time. We would therefore expect the number of death occurrences to be higher in future releases.\n\nMonthly mortality analysis, England and Wales Dataset | Released 18 January 2021 Monthly data on death registrations and death occurrences in England and Wales, broken down by sex and age.

The map uses Middle layer Super Output Areas, which are areas that each have a similarly sized population and remain stable over time.\nFurther analysis of death registrations data for England and Wales, including breakdowns by sex and age, are presented in Monthly mortality analysis, England and Wales: December 2020.\n", "id": 334}, {"document": "In February 2021, there were 55,489 deaths registered in England, 11,421 deaths (25.9%) more than the five-year average (2015 to 2019) for February; in Wales, there were 3,199 deaths registered, 260 deaths (8.9%) more than the five-year average for February.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) was the leading cause of death in February 2021 for the fourth consecutive month in both England (accounting for 30.1% of all deaths registered in February) and in Wales (22.2% of all deaths).\nThe second-leading cause of death was dementia and Alzheimer's disease in England, and ischaemic heart diseases in Wales; COVID-19 accounted for more than three times the number of deaths than the second-leading cause in England and more than two times in Wales.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) of deaths due to COVID-19 in February 2021 was 392.3 deaths per 100,000 people in England, the first decrease since August 2020, and 272.2 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales, the first decrease since September 2020.\nThe East of England was the English region with the highest mortality rate for deaths due to COVID-19 in February 2021 (477.1 deaths per 100,000 people), followed by London (465.5 deaths per 100,000 people); the South West continued to have the lowest COVID-19 mortality rate, at 258.5 deaths per 100,000 people.\nIn England, the mortality rate for deaths due to COVID-19 in February 2021 in the most deprived areas was 585.4 deaths per 100,000 people; this was 2.1 times the mortality rate in the least deprived areas (282.0 deaths per 100,000 people).\nIn Wales, the COVID-19 mortality rate in the most deprived areas was 1.3 times the mortality rate in the least deprived areas (324.4 deaths per 100,000 people in the most deprived areas, 247.0 deaths per 100,000 people in the least deprived areas).\n\n!\n\nThis month's bulletin includes an interactive map of deaths due to COVID-19 in each Middle layer Super Output Area (see Section 3). The accompanying datasets also include mortality rates for deaths due to COVID-19 by local area and deprivation, deaths involving COVID-19 for the UK and pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19 in 2020.\n\n\n\nBased on provisional data, there were 55,489 deaths registered in England in February 2021. This was 14,680 more deaths than in February 2020 and 11,421 deaths more than the five-year average (2015 to 2019). The five-year average has been provided for 2015 to 2019 (rather than 2016 to 2020) because of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on deaths registered in 2020. The average for 2015 to 2019 provides a comparison of the number of deaths expected per month in a usual (non-pandemic) year. Of the deaths registered in February 2021, 28,190 were males and 27,299 were females.\nIn Wales, the provisional number of deaths registered in February 2021 was 3,199. This was 450 more deaths than in February 2020 and 260 more deaths than the five-year average for February. Of the deaths registered in February in Wales, there were 1,593 male deaths and 1,606 female deaths.\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) are used for comparisons over time rather than numbers of deaths, as ASMRs account for changes to the population size and age structure. In England, mortality rates for the month of February had been generally decreasing since our data time series began in 2001, from 1,339.3 deaths per 100,000 people in 2001, to a low of 943.6 deaths per 100,000 people in February 2020. The statistically significant decrease in age-standardised mortality rates from 2001 was seen in both males and females (Figure 1). \nIn England, the February 2021 mortality rate (1,304.5 deaths per 100,000 people) was significantly higher than the mortality rate for February in every year back to 2006. The first year in this analysis, 2001, was the only year to have a significantly higher February mortality rate than 2021. The mortality rate in February 2021 was 1,533.7 deaths per 100,000 males (compared with 1,616.5 in February 2001) and 1,113.0 deaths per 100,000 females (compared with 1,148.7 in February 2001).\nIn Wales, 2001 (the start of our data time series) was also the year with the highest February mortality rate. Over time, mortality rates in Wales have decreased from 1,431.2 deaths per 100,000 people in February 2001 to a low of 1,042.1 deaths per 100,000 people in February 2020. In February 2021, the mortality rate significantly increased (compared with February 2020) to 1,229.0 deaths per 100,000 people, with both males and females experiencing an increase in deaths.\nThe doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death. Using this information, we determine an underlying cause of death. More information on this process can be found in our user guide.\nIn February in most cases (87.6% in England and 84.1% in Wales) where the coronavirus (COVID-19) was mentioned on the death certificate, it was found to be the underlying cause of death. For more information on our definition of COVID-19 deaths, see Section 11: Measuring the data.\n\n!\n\nIn this bulletin, we use the term \u201cdue to COVID-19\u201d when referring only to deaths with an underlying cause of death of COVID-19 and we use the term \u201cinvolving COVID-19\u201d when referring to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether as an underlying cause or not.\n\n\n\nOf the 55,489 deaths registered in February 2021 in England, 30.1% (16,682 deaths) were due to COVID-19. Taking into account all deaths involving COVID-19 increases the percentage to 34.3% of all deaths (19,049 deaths) in England in February 2021.\nIn Wales, 22.2% of the 3,199 deaths registered in February 2021 were due to COVID-19 (711 deaths). Taking into account all deaths involving COVID-19 increases the percentage to 26.4% of all deaths (845 deaths) in Wales.\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) allow us to adjust for the size and age structure of the population. ASMRs for deaths due to COVID-19 had been increasing month-on-month (since the increase between August and September 2020 in England and between September and October 2020 in Wales), but significantly decreased in February 2021 (Figure 2). \nIn England, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly decreased for the first time since August 2020, with a rate of 392.3 deaths per 100,000 people in February 2021. \nIn Wales, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly decreased in February 2021, with a rate of 272.2 deaths per 100,000 people. This is the first significant decrease since July 2020. \nIn January 2021, the mortality rates for deaths due to COVID-19 were similar in England and Wales (549.6 deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 people in England and 541.7 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales). The COVID-19 mortality rate dropped significantly in both countries in February 2021, but the mortality rate in England was 44.1% higher than in Wales (392.3 deaths per 100,000 people in England compared with 272.2 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales). This is the largest percentage difference between the two countries since March 2020.\nIn England, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly decreased in February 2021 for both males (from 680.8 to 483.8 per 100,000 males) and females (from 448.5 to 319.2 per 100,000 females). The mortality rate for deaths due to COVID-19 was significantly higher in males than in females in every month from March 2020 to February 2021.\nIn Wales, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 also significantly decreased in February 2021 for both males (from 673.0 to 335.1 per 100,000 males) and females (from 440.0 to 223.0 per 100,000 females). Males in Wales also had a higher mortality rate for deaths due to COVID-19 than females between March 2020 and February 2021, though this difference was not statistically significant in every month. More information on mortality rates by sex is available in Tables 3a and 3b of the accompanying dataset.\nSuper Output Areas (SOAs) are small-area statistical geographies covering England and Wales. Each area has a similarly sized population and remains stable over time. For this analysis, Middle layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) have been used. The accompanying dataset shows the number of deaths from all causes as well as deaths due to COVID-19.\nThe following interactive map allows you to see the cumulative number of monthly deaths due to COVID-19 in each area.\n.xls\nOur leading causes of death groupings are based on a list developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This categorises causes of death using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) into groups that are epidemiologically more meaningful than single ICD-10 codes, for the purpose of comparing the most common causes of death in the population.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the 10 most common underlying causes of death registered in February 2021 for England and Wales, compared with the five-year average for February (2015 to 2019).\nIn both England and Wales, the coronavirus (COVID-19) was the leading cause of death in February 2021, with 392.3 deaths per 100,000 people in England (16,682 deaths) and 272.2 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales (711 deaths). This was the fourth consecutive month where COVID-19 was the leading cause of death.\nThe rate of deaths due to COVID-19 was significantly higher than the next-leading cause of death in both England and Wales. In England, the second-most common cause of death in February 2021 was dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with 112.9 deaths per 100,000 people (4,841 deaths). The COVID-19 mortality rate was more than three times the second-leading cause of death in England. \nIn Wales, the second-most common cause of death was ischaemic heart diseases, with 134.8 deaths per 100,000 people (349 deaths). The COVID-19 mortality rate was more than two times the second-leading cause of death in Wales.\nIn England in February 2021, 7 of the 10 leading causes of death were significantly lower than the five-year average (2015 to 2019), with signs, symptoms and ill-defined conditions, and malignant neoplasm of colon, sigmoid, rectum and anus both having a similar mortality rate to the five-year average. In particular, the mortality rate for deaths with an underlying cause of Influenza or Pneumonia was 64.8% lower in February 2021 than the five-year average for February.\nIn Wales, 4 of the 11 leading causes were significantly lower than the five-year average. Similar to England, the February 2021 mortality rate for Influenza or Pneumonia was 73.2% lower than the five-year average.\nGenerally, since 2001 (the beginning of our data time series), the age-standardised mortality rates for people aged both 0 to 74 years and 75 years and over have been decreasing in England and Wales. However, similar to the trend seen in all ages (Section 2), mortality rates in both England and Wales have increased in 2020 and 2021 for the age group 75 years and over and in England for the under 75 years age group. More information on mortality rates by sex and age group (including age-specific mortality rates by five-year age group for people aged 75 years and over) is available in Tables 5 to 9 of the accompanying dataset.\nThere were 124,287 deaths registered in England and 7,630 in Wales during the first two months (January to February) of 2021.\nTo gain a better idea of year-to-year differences in mortality rates, we calculated year-to-date age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) based on deaths registered in January to February of each year from 2001 to 2021 (Figure 6). For England, the year-to-date age-standardised mortality rate for 2021 was 1,387.2 deaths per 100,000 people, which was statistically significantly higher than all years between 2004 and 2020.\nFor Wales, the year-to-date age-standardised mortality rate for 2021 was 1,390.9 deaths per 100,000 people. This was significantly higher than the same period in 2019 and 2020.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate for January to February was higher in Wales than in England in every year since our data time series began in 2001. This difference was significant in most years (only years 2008, 2012 and 2021 showed no significant difference). The smallest difference between England and Wales was in January to February 2021, with the two countries showing similar year-to-date mortality rates (1,387.2 deaths per 100,000 people in England, 1,390.9 in Wales).\nThis section is based on the date a death occurred \u2013 rather than the date of registration used in the previous sections \u2013 to monitor current mortality trends. Analysis of deaths by date of registration is useful as the figures are comparable across time and geography. Because of the length of time that it takes a death to be registered, using data based on registration can mean that we are not monitoring the most current death trends. For example, a death registered in February 2021 could have occurred in a previous month or even a previous year. Further information regarding death occurrences and registration delays can be found in Section 11: Measuring the data.\nBetween 1 January and 28 February 2021, 114,812 deaths occurred in England (and were registered by 7 March 2021). This was 19,682 more deaths than the five-year average (2015 to 2019) for January to February (20.7% higher). Of the 114,812 deaths that occurred, 35.3% were due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) (40,523 deaths).\nIn Wales, 7,062 deaths occurred in January to February 2021 (and were registered by 7 March 2021). This was 721 more deaths than the five-year average (11.4% higher). COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death in 29.8% of all deaths that occurred (2,108 deaths).\nIn England, the first death due to COVID-19 occurred on 30 January 2020 (Figure 7). Since 11 March 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths occurring on each day rose (except for 6 April 2020, when it decreased by 14 deaths) until the peak of 1,223 deaths that occurred on 8 April 2020. Since 8 April, the number of COVID-19 deaths each day had generally been decreasing but began increasing again from mid-September. The number of daily COVID-19 deaths had continued to increase, reaching 1,182 deaths on 19 January 2021 (the highest since 8 April 2020 at 1,223 deaths). Since then, the number of COVID-19 deaths has been decreasing, with 154 deaths due to COVID-19 occurring on 28 February 2021 (though the number of death occurrences on more recent dates is likely to rise as we receive more death registrations).\nIn Wales, the first death with an underlying cause of COVID-19 occurred on 15 March 2020. As in England, the number of COVID-19 deaths per day reached the peak on 8 April 2020, when 70 deaths due to COVID-19 occurred in Wales. \nSince 8 April, the number of COVID-19 deaths occurring each day in Wales had been gradually decreasing, with no COVID-19 deaths occurring on 41 days between June and September. However, daily COVID-19 deaths increased throughout October 2020 to January 2021, with 76 deaths occurring on 11 January 2021 (though this may be higher due to registration delays). This is the highest number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 in Wales to-date. Since then, the number of COVID-19 deaths has been decreasing in Wales; trends on more recent dates should be treated with caution as numbers of deaths are likely to rise as we receive more death registrations. In particular, instances where the number of death occurrences on each day in February was below the range of the last five years, are likely to be a result of when the data extract was created.\nData on pre-existing conditions of people who died due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) in England and Wales for 2020 can be found in the accompanying dataset. Detailed information on this analysis is available in the January 2021 edition of this bulletin. This analysis will be updated on a quarterly basis in the April edition.\n\nMonthly mortality analysis, England and Wales  Dataset | Released 18 March 2021  Monthly data on death registrations and death occurrences in England and Wales, broken down by sex and age.

In Wales, COVID-19 accounted for just over a fifth (22.2%) of the 3,199 deaths registered in February.\nThis made COVID-19 the leading cause of death for the fourth consecutive month in both England and Wales.\nHowever, the age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) for deaths due to COVID-19 significantly decreased in February for the first time since summer 2020. ASMRs provide a mortality rate that takes into account the size and age structure of the population.\nIn England, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 fell from 549.6 deaths per 100,000 people in January to 392.3 in February. This is the first significant decrease since August 2020.\nIn Wales, the ASMR for deaths due to COVID-19 fell from 541.7 per 100,000 people in January to 272.2 in February. This is the first time the ASMR in Wales has fallen significantly since July 2020.\nIn February, the COVID-19 mortality rate in England was 44.1% higher than in Wales. This is the largest percentage difference between the two countries since March 2020.\nFurther analysis of death registration data for England and Wales is presented in Monthly mortality analysis, England and Wales: February 2021.\n", "id": 375}, {"document": "Total online job adverts on 12 March 2021 were at 93% of their average level in February 2020; this is the highest level observed since 12 March 2020, driven by rises across all UK countries and regions (Adzuna).

For more details, see the Measuring the data section. \n\n\n\nThe number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour.\u00a0These figures use job adverts provided by\u00a0Adzuna, an online job search engine, and include\u00a0experimental estimates\u00a0of online job adverts by Adzuna category and by UK country and\u00a0NUTS1\u00a0region. The\u00a0Adzuna\u00a0categories used do not correspond to\u00a0Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)\u00a0categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Vacancy Survey.\u00a0\nUsers should note that, from the 18 March 2021 publication onwards, an improved process has been put in place to generate more accurate estimates of weekly job adverts by NUTS1 region. This change has been backdated so that it applies across the entirety of all indices, from 7 February 2018 onwards. More detail is provided on this in Using Adzuna data to derive an indicator of weekly vacancies. \nIndex of job adverts on Adzuna by category, 100 = average job adverts in February 2020, UK, 7 February 2020 to 12 March 2021 \nData download\nAccording to Adzuna, on 12 March 2021, total online job adverts were at 93% of their average level in February 2020, an increase of 5 percentage points from 5 March 2021. This marks a continuation of the steady recovery in weekly job adverts observed since reaching their lowest point in May 2020 and is the highest volume of overall weekly job adverts observed on Adzuna since 12 March 2020. \nExcluding the \u201cunknown\u201d category, compared with 5 March 2021 the volume of online job adverts increased in all Adzuna categories except \u201clegal\u201d, which fell by 8 percentage points. On 12 March 2021 \u201clegal\u201d job adverts on Adzuna stood at 72% of their average level in February 2020. \nThe \"transport, logistics and warehouse\" category saw the largest week-on-week increase in weekly online job adverts of 23 percentage points to 159% of its average level in February 2020. This was followed by the \"domestic help\" and \"energy, oil and gas\" categories, which both saw week-on-week increases of 10 percentage points.\nIndex of job adverts on Adzuna by category, 100 = average job adverts in February 2020, UK, 7 February 2020 to 12 March 2021\nData download\nAccording to Adzuna, on 12 March 2021, the volume of online job adverts increased in all UK regions and countries compared with 5 March 2021. Northern Ireland saw the largest week-on-week increase in online job adverts, by 15 percentage points. This was followed by the North East and West Midlands, which saw increases of 9 and 6 percentage points to 124% and 105% of their average level in February 2020, respectively. The smallest week-on-week changes were in Wales and Scotland, which both saw increases of 3 percentage points. \nOn 12 March 2021, online job adverts on Adzuna exceeded their February 2020 average level in Northern Ireland, the North East, the East Midlands, the West Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, and the South West. As a proportion of their pre-pandemic levels, on 12 March 2021, online job adverts were lowest in London, the South East, and Scotland, standing at 80%, 84% and 87% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively. \nThese data series are experimental faster indicators for estimating UK spending on credit and debit cards. They track the daily Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) payments made by credit and debit card payment processors to around 100 major UK retail corporates. These payments are the proceeds of recent credit and debit card transactions made by customers at their stores, both via physical and via online platforms. More information on the indicator is provided in the accompanying Bank of England methodology article.\nCompanies are allocated to one of four categories based on their primary business:\n\"staples\" refers to companies that sell essential goods that households need to purchase, such as food and utilities\n\"work-related\" refers to companies providing public transport or selling petrol\n\"delayable\" refers to companies selling goods whose purchase could be delayed, such as clothing or furnishings\n\"social\" refers to spending on travel and eating out\nFigure 3 shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors, \"merchant acquirers\". \nIn the week to 11 March 2021, the CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases in aggregate decreased 3 percentage points from the previous week to 80% of its February 2020 average, with a decline in all four individual consumption categories since the previous week. This follows last week's large increase that was primarily driven by an increase in \"staples\" coinciding with the turn of the month. Spending on \"staples\" normally reduces around this stage of the month after the earlier peak around the turn of the month. In the latest week, card spending on \"staples\" was at 115% of its February 2020 average. On the other hand, \"delayable\", \"social\" and \"work-related\" purchases were 63%, 63% and 72% of their levels in February 2020, respectively.\nSince the substantial fall in spending at the beginning of 2021 that followed the Christmas period and introduction of national lockdowns across the UK, the CHAPS-based indicator of debit and credit card purchases has gradually increased in all four consumption categories and remains above the troughs observed during the spring 2020 lockdown.\nThe full data time series available for data on UK spending on debit and credit cards can be found in the\u00a0accompanying dataset.\n\nMore about coronavirus   Find the latest on coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK.

The survey was live for the period 8 to 16 March 2021.\nThese dates should be kept in mind in relation to local and national lockdown measures in place during the reference period and the date when the business responded. All four nations within the UK were subject to lockdowns during the reference and survey live periods.\nFor experimental single site weighted regional estimates that have been updated up to Wave 21 (29 December 2020 to 10 January 2021), please see Understanding the business impacts of local and national restrictions: February 2021.\nHeadline indicators from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS), 22 February to 16 March 2021 \nData download\nThe preliminary result of 19% of businesses' workforce on furlough leave in February 2021 equates to approximately 6 million people. These numbers are based on multiplying the BICS-weighted furlough proportions by the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) total annual employment. This will not be consistent with employment estimates from Labour market statistics as these are based on different sources over different time periods, but provides an indication of the use of furlough.\nAdditionally, the BICS proportion furloughed figure does not include the public sector, financial sector and parts of agriculture.\nAcross all UK industries in Wave 26:\n72% of businesses had been trading for more than the last two weeks (unchanged from Wave 25)\n2% of businesses had started trading within the last two weeks after a pause in trading (unchanged from Wave 25)\n4% of businesses had paused trading but intend to restart in the next two weeks (broadly unchanged from Wave 25)\n20% of businesses had paused trading and do not intend to restart in the next two weeks (broadly unchanged from Wave 25)\n3% of businesses had permanently ceased trading (broadly unchanged from Wave 25)\nTable 1 shows the financial performance of businesses currently trading.\nThis section includes some provisional results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) covering the period 10 to 14 March 2021. The survey went out to 6,025 adults in Great Britain and had a response rate of 75%.\nFurther information to help understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain, will be available in\u00a0Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain published on 19 March 2021.\nIn the week ending 14 March 2021, the proportion of working adults in Great Britain who in the last seven days:\ntravelled to work (either exclusively or in combination with working from home) has increased by 5 percentage points from the previous week to 53%\nworked exclusively from home has decreased by 6 percentage points from the previous week to 30%\nneither travelled to work nor worked from home remains unchanged compared with last week at 16%\nThe increase in travel to work and decrease in work from home compared with the previous week coincides with schools re-opening in England from 8 March 2021.\nOf the 94% of adults that reported they had left home in the last seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for food and medicine decreased slightly by 2 percentage points compared with last week to 74%.\nThe proportion of these adults who shopped for things other than food and medicine in the last seven days increased slightly compared with the previous week to 11%. This is a continuation of small, gradual increases observed since the week ending 24 January 2021 when the corresponding figure was 5%. The generally low level coincides with the ongoing lockdowns throughout England.\nNational footfall figures are supplied by Springboard, a provider of data on customer activity. They measure the following for overall UK retail footfall, as well as by high street, retail park, and shopping centre categories:\ndaily retail footfall as a percentage of its level on the same day of the equivalent week of the previous year; for example, Saturday 13 March 2021 is compared with Saturday 14 March 2020\ntotal weekly retail footfall as a percentage of its level in the equivalent week of the prior year; for example, footfall in Week 10 of 2021 is compared with its level in Week 10 of 2020\nthe percentage change in weekly footfall compared with the previous week; for example, Week 10 of 2021 is compared with Week 9 of 2021\nSpringboard's weekly data are defined over a seven-day period running from Sunday to Saturday; Week 10 of 2021 therefore refers to the period Sunday 7 March 2021 to Saturday 13 March 2021\n\n\nFigure 5: In the week to 13 March 2021, overall retail footfall in the UK was at 47% of its level in the equivalent week of 2020, an increase of 5 percentage points from last week \nVolume of retail footfall, percentage compared with the same day of the equivalent week of the previous year, UK, 1 March 2020 to 13 March 2021\n\nSource: Springboard and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\nNotes:\n\nThe vertical lines indicate the following key events: first national lockdowns imposed; lockdown restrictions begin to ease across the UK; circuit-breaker lockdown in England; regional restrictions begin in England; national lockdown begins in England.\nThe spike on Monday 24 August 2020 was caused by the comparison with 26 August 2019, which was bank holiday Monday with good weather. The bank holiday this year was a week later, on 31 August 2020.\nThe spikes on 23 December and 30 December 2020 are because of the year-on-year comparison with 25 December 2019 and 1 January 2020 respectively, which were bank holidays.\n\nDownload this image Figure 5: In the week to 13 March 2021, overall retail footfall in the UK was at 47% of its level in the equivalent week of 2020, an increase of 5 percentage points from last week \n.PNG (125.2 kB)\n\n\nAccording to Springboard, in the week to 13 March 2021, overall retail footfall in the UK was at 47% of its level in the equivalent week of 2020, an increase of 5 percentage points when compared with the value of the same index in the previous week.\nFootfall at retail parks continues its relative strength compared with high streets and shopping centres. In the same seven-day period, footfall at retail parks was at 76% of its level in the equivalent week of 2020 whereas the corresponding figures for high streets and shopping centres were 40% and 36%, respectively. On Saturday 13 March 2021, footfall at retail parks reached 88% of its level in the equivalent day of 2020; this is the highest estimate since before Christmas, on 24 December 2020.\nAll retail locations saw a week-on-week increase in footfall, with shopping centres increasing by 10%, retail parks by 7% and high streets by 6% between the weeks ending 6 March and 13 March 2021.\nRegional footfall figures are also supplied by Springboard and show the volume of overall retail footfall compared with the same day of the equivalent week of the previous year, by UK region.\n\n\nFigure 6: In the week to 13 March 2021, daily retail footfall in all UK countries and regions continues to be substantially lower than its level in the equivalent period of 2020 \nVolume of overall daily retail footfall, percentage of the level recorded on the same day of the equivalent week of the previous year, UK regions, 1 March 2020 to 13 March 2021\n\nSource: Springboard and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\nDownload this image Figure 6: In the week to 13 March 2021, daily retail footfall in all UK countries and regions continues to be substantially lower than its level in the equivalent period of 2020 \n.png (120.0 kB)\n\n\nAccording to Springboard, daily retail footfall in all UK countries and regions continues to be substantially lower than its level in the equivalent period of 2020. However, there are large regional differences with some areas seeing stronger retail footfall than others.\nDaily retail footfall was generally strongest in the South East, West Midlands, the North and Yorkshire, and Greater London. In contrast, it was generally weakest in the East Midlands, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nFor example, on Saturday 13 March 2021, retail footfall in the East Midlands was at 41% of its level recorded on the Saturday of the equivalent week of 2020, whereas the corresponding figure for Greater London was 51%. Users should note that this comparison has been made using figures for Saturday as this is typically the busiest day of the week for retail locations.\nThese shipping indicators are based on counts of all vessels, and cargo and tanker vessels. As discussed in\u00a0Faster indicators of UK economic activity: shipping, we expect the shipping indicators to be related to the import and export of goods.\n\n\nFigure 7: There was an average of 291 daily ship visits in the week ending 14 March 2021, a 17% decrease from the previous week and 18% lower than the same period a year ago\nDaily movements in shipping visits, UK, seasonally adjusted, 1 December 2019 to 14 March 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: exactEarth\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 7: There was an average of 291 daily ship visits in the week ending 14 March 2021, a 17% decrease from the previous week and 18% lower than the same period a year ago\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nIn the week ending 14 March 2021, the seven-day average of all daily shipping visits was 291, a decrease of 17% from the previous week and 18% lower than the same period a year ago. This fall from the previous week can be attributed to reduced activity in numerous UK ports including Southampton, Portsmouth, and Grimsby and Immingham, and may have been affected by the strong winds on 11 March 2021. \nThis large fall in the latest week follows the steady growth seen in recent weeks and more generally the strong upward trend seen since the beginning of the year. It should be noted that a comparable fall was recorded between Week 10 and Week 11 of 2020 when the seven-day average of all daily shipping visits decreased by 15% from 411 visits to 356 visits. However, the equivalent week last year coincides with the early impacts seen of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK. \n\n\nFigure 8: There was on average of 93 cargo and tanker ship visits in the week ending 14 March 2021, a 14% decrease from the previous week and 23% lower than the same period a year ago\nDaily movements in shipping visits, UK, seasonally adjusted, 1 December 2019 to 14 March 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: exactEarth\n\nNotes:\n\nThe vertical lines indicate key events.

More information is available in the Coronavirus and the latest indicators for the UK economy and society methodology.\nThe seasonal adjustment method may be limited as this is a short time series.\nDaily and weekly shipping visits and unique visits are available by port in the dataset, along with non-seasonally adjusted aggregate series.\nThe trend is now calculated as a rolling seven-day average of the number of daily ship and cargo and tanker ship visits. The presentation of the series has been shifted three days forward, this does not affect the calculation of the average.\nUsers should note that a reduction in shipping activity has been observed over the Christmas periods in 2019 and 2020.\n\n\nDownload this chart Figure 8: There was on average of 93 cargo and tanker ship visits in the week ending 14 March 2021, a 14% decrease from the previous week and 23% lower than the same period a year ago\nImage\n\n.csv\n\n\n.xls\n\n\n\nIn the week ending 12 March 2021, the seven-day average of all daily cargo and tanker ship visits was 93, a 14% decrease from the 108 visits recorded the previous week. It is also 23% lower than the level observed in the same period last year when 120 visits were recorded for the week ending 15 March 2020. As with total ship visits, this weekly fall follows a steady recovery since the beginning of the year. Again, it should be noted that a similar dip in the number of cargo and tanker visits was observed between Week 10 and Week 11 of 2020, though this period coincided with the early impacts seen of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK. \nAccording to Department for Transport (DfT) non-seasonally adjusted road traffic data, the volume of all motor vehicle traffic as of Monday 15 March 2021 saw a slight weekly increase to 78% of the level seen on the first week in February 2020. This is a continuation of the recent upward trend but is still below pre-Christmas levels and 22% below the level seen in the first week of February 2020.\nCar and light commercial vehicle traffic each showed slight increases on the previous week\u2019s figures. Cars saw an increase of 2 percentage points to 72% of the level seen on the same day of the first week in February 2020, whereas light commercial vehicles increased slightly by 1 percentage point to 94% of the level seen on the same day of the first week in February 2020. Heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) saw no change, remaining at 105% of the level seen on the same day of the first week in February 2020.\n\n\nFigure 9: The volume of motor vehicle traffic on Monday 15 March 2021 saw a slight increase compared with the previous week, but was still 22% below its level in the first week of February 2020 \nDaily road traffic index: 100 = same traffic as the equivalent day of the week in the first week of February 2020, 1 March 2020 to 15 March 2021, non-seasonally adjusted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Department for Transport \u2013 road traffic statistics: management information\n\nNotes:\n\nThe vertical lines indicate key events.

The data provided are useful as an indication of traffic change rather than actual traffic volumes. More information on the methods, quality and economic analysis for these indicators can be found in the\u00a0DfT methodology article.\nTraffic cameras are a valuable source for understanding the level of activity in towns and cities as well as changing patterns of mobility. The UK has thousands of publicly accessible traffic cameras with providers ranging from national agencies to local authorities. Further information on the methodology used to produce these data is available in our\u00a0methodology article\u00a0and\u00a0Data Science Campus blog.\nIn the\u00a0accompanying dataset, the following categories are available as non-seasonally adjusted, seasonally adjusted and trend data:\ncars\nmotorbikes (only available for London and the North East)\nbuses\ntrucks\nvans\npedestrians and cyclists\nThe categories are available for the following regions, which give a broad coverage across the UK and represent a range of different-sized settlements in urban and rural settings:\nLondon\nGreater Manchester\nNorth East\nNorthern Ireland\nSouthend\nReading\nTraffic camera activity in selected areas, daily counts of cars, buses, pedestrians and cyclists, UK, seasonally adjusted, March 2020 to March 2021\nData download\nIn the week ending 14 March 2021, average counts of traffic activity for cars increased in London by 10% and the North East of England by 9%, whilst Northern Ireland remained broadly unchanged when compared with the previous week. \nAverage counts of traffic activity for buses also increased in both the North East and London by 4%, with Northern Ireland again remaining broadly unchanged when compared with last week. The increase in traffic camera activity for cars and buses compared with the previous week coincides with schools re-opening in England from 8 March 2021.\nThe level of pedestrians and cyclists remained similar in the latest week for both London and the North East, whilst that for Northern Ireland decreased by 22%. However, caution should be taken when interpreting this weekly change for Northern Ireland because of the relatively low numbers of counts.\nAverage counts of traffic activity for cars are now at 86% of the average level seen between 11 March and 22 March 2020 (before the first lockdown) for both London and the North East. In the North East, the equivalent figure for buses is now at 104%, whilst London is at 87% of its pre-lockdown average. An equivalent comparison cannot be made for Northern Ireland as data are only available from May 2020.\nAccording to Companies House, in the week to Friday 12 March 2021, there were 16,547 company incorporations in the UK, a 13% decrease from the previous week but still higher than the equivalent weeks in 2019 and 2020 by 3% and 9%, respectively. This is a fallback from a higher level in the previous week because of a backlog of applications. \n\n\nFigure 11: There were 16,547 company incorporations in the UK in the week to 12 March 2021, a 13% decrease from the previous week \nTotal weekly company incorporations, UK, from week ending Friday 4 January 2019 to week ending Friday 12 March 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Companies House and Office for National Statistics\n\nNotes:\n\nWeek 1 refers to the period week ending 4 January 2019, 3 January 2020 and 1 January 2021.

Details of the methodology used for these indicators can be found in Online price changes methodology. This analysis is experimental and should not be compared with our regular monthly consumer price statistics.\nThe data time series, weekly growth rates, and contributions to the weekly change for all individual food and drink items, along with sample sizes, are published in a dataset alongside this release.\nThe overall price of items in the online food and drink basket decreased by 0.1% between the week ending 14 March 2021 and the previous week, with six categories providing negative contributions to the overall price movement, three providing positive contributions and five making negligible contributions to the overall movement.\nUsers should note there is currently a data processing issue with the \u201cReady meal\u201d index, which has resulted in missing data affecting the current week, plus the previous five weeks. This is expected to be corrected by next week, with no expected impact on the main drivers for price movements for this and previous publications.\nThe main downward contributors to the overall price movement in the latest week were \u201cmineral waters, soft drinks and juices\u201d, where prices fell by 0.7%, and \u201cmeat\u201d, where prices fell by 0.4%. Both categories contributed negative 0.05 percentage points to the overall price movement. For \u201cmeat\u201d, this price decrease was because of falling prices for over half of its sub-categories; particularly for bacon, lamb and ham portions, as well as meat snacks and pies. For \u201cmineral waters, soft drinks and juices\u201d, the fall was mainly driven by a decrease in the price of fruit juices and fruit squash.\nThe main offsetting category was \u201cbread and cereals\u201d, which experienced a 0.4% price increase and contributed positive 0.06 percentage points to the overall price movement. The main driver behind this was the rising price of breakfast cereal at three retailers.\n\nUK spending on credit and debit cardsDataset | Released\u00a018 March\u00a02021 These data series are experimental faster indicators for monitoring UK retail purchases\u00a0derived from the Bank of England's Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) data.Weekly and daily shipping indicators Dataset | Released\u00a018 March 2021 The weekly and daily shipping indicators dataset associated with the faster indicators of UK economic activity.Traffic camera activity Dataset | Released\u00a018 March 2021 Experimental dataset for busyness indices covering the UKOnline weekly price changes Dataset | Released 18 March 2021 The online price changes for a selection of food and drink products from several large UK retailers.

This is the highest level seen since 12 March 2020, around the time that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began.\nThe overall volume of weekly online job adverts increased by 4 percentage points. The increase was driven by a rise in job adverts across all countries and regions of the UK when compared with the week to 5 March 2021.\nNorthern Ireland saw the largest week-on-week increase in online job adverts, by 15 percentage points. This was followed by the North East and West Midlands, which saw increases of 9 and 6 percentage points to 124% and 105% of their average level in February 2020, respectively. The smallest week-on-week changes were in Wales and Scotland, which both saw increases of 3 percentage points.\nOn 12 March 2021, online job adverts on Adzuna exceeded their February 2020 average level in Northern Ireland, the North East, the East Midlands, the West Midlands, Yorkshire and & The Humber, and the South West.\n", "id": 379}, {"document": "Since the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there were 173,974 deaths of care home residents (wherever the death occurred) in England and Wales, this is an increase of 19.5% compared with the five-year average (145,560 deaths); of these, 42,341 involved COVID-19 accounting for 24.3% of all deaths of care home residents.\nDeaths of care home residents involving COVID-19 increased sharply in wave one, however there were a higher proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave two (25.7%) than wave one (23.1%).\nCaution is advised comparing between the two waves since the higher proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave two could be attributed to undiagnosed COVID-19 cases in the first wave.\nBy contrast, there were more total deaths of care home residents above the five-year average in wave one (27,079 excess deaths) than in wave two (1,335 excess deaths).\nThis may be because of delayed access to care services and rapid testing during wave one; and lower care home occupancy, vaccine availability and mortality displacement in wave two.\nDuring the first and second wave, COVID-19 was the leading cause of death in male care home residents while Dementia and Alzheimer disease was the leading cause of death in female care home residents.\nDementia and Alzheimer disease was the most common pre-existing condition found among deaths due to COVID-19 in both male and female care home residents in wave one and wave two.\n\n!\n\nThe figures within this article are based on when a date was registered, not the date a death occurred and should not be compared with occurrence data in previous articles. \n\n\n\nThere have been fluctuations in occupancy rates of care homes as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic therefore we have been unable to accurately estimate a care resident population for 2021, because of this mortality rates have not been calculated within this publication.\nUsing death registration data, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has defined the waves of the pandemic as:\nWave one: deaths registered up to 12 September 2020\nWave two: deaths registered from 12 September 2020 (inclusive)\nThe first care home resident death involving COVID-19 was registered on 17 March 2020 therefore the week ending 20 March 2020 will form the beginning of wave one in this article. Wave two is from 12 September 2020 up to the most recent data we have available (week ending 2 April 2021). Wave one and wave two constitute 26 and 29 weeks respectively.\n\"Deaths of care home residents\" refers to both (a) deaths occurring in a care home to residents, and (b) deaths where the deceased resided in a care home but died elsewhere. The figures should not be confused with \"deaths in care homes\" reported in other publications, which refers only to category (a).\nThe term \"due to COVID-19\" refers to deaths with an underlying cause of death as COVID-19, the term \"involving COVID-19\" refers to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate.\nBetween Week 12 2020 (week ending 20 March 2020) and Week 13 2021 (week ending 2 April 2021), 173,974 deaths of care home residents were registered in England and Wales. This is an increase of 19.5% compared with the five-year average (145,560 deaths).\nTotal deaths of care home residents decreased between wave one and wave two (89,528 and 84,446 deaths respectively). Total deaths at the peak of wave one were 3.4 times higher than the five-year average compared with 1.3 times higher at the peak of wave two. Overall, excess deaths (see Glossary) of care home residents were 1.4 times higher in wave one (27,079 excess deaths) compared with 1.0 times higher in wave two (1,335 excess deaths).\nOf the 173,974 deaths (registered between week ending 20 March 2020 and week ending 2 April 2021), 42,341 mentioned \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d (COVID-19), accounting for 24.3% of all care home resident deaths. Using the rate of change calculation (see Glossary), the peak of deaths involving COVID-19 in care homes was reached nearly two times faster in wave one than in wave two. While the sharpest rise in deaths involving COVID-19 occurred in wave one there was a higher proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave two. In wave one, 20,664 deaths of care home residents (23.1%) mentioned COVID-19 compared with 21,677 deaths (25.7%) in wave two.\nHowever, the higher proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave two could be attributed to undiagnosed COVID-19 cases in the first wave because of less testing and less clinical experience with a new disease.\nWe would expect to see the observed increase in \u201cconfirmed\u201d COVID-19 cases in wave two because of an increase in testing. In line with this, of the 20,664 deaths involving COVID-19 of care home residents in wave one, 17,400 (84.2%) were \"confirmed\" COVID-19 and 3,246 (15.7%) were \"suspected\" COVID-19. Of the 21,677 deaths involving COVID-19 in wave two, 21,541 (99.4%) were \u201cconfirmed\" and 117 (0.5%) were \"suspected\".\nCaution needs to be taken when interpreting these results since the higher number of excess deaths in wave one could be because of:\ndelayed access to care services such as local COVID-19 alert level system and personal protective equipment (PPE) at the beginning of the pandemic\nunavailability of rapid testing during wave one of the pandemic\navailability of vaccinations during wave two\n\u201cmortality displacement\u201d where the higher number of deaths in wave one could be contributing to the lower levels observed in wave two, because some people who may have otherwise died in wave two could have died in wave one\nlower levels of care home occupancy in wave two; possible reasons for this could include; the care home population may not yet have returned to normal after a greater number of deaths earlier in the year, care homes limiting capacity because of social distancing measures and a delay in individuals moving into care homes due to perceived risk of infection. See Direct and Indirect Impacts of COVID-19 on Excess Deaths and Morbidity (PDF, 1.81MB).\nTherefore, all these factors may be a contributary to the lower excess deaths in wave two.\nFor information on England and Wales separately and comparator figures from the Care Quality Commission and Care Inspectorate Wales please see accompanying dataset.\nIn England and Wales, excess deaths of care home residents in care homes were highest in wave one (25,615 excess deaths) compared with wave two (2,537 excess deaths). This is compared to hospitals where there were 1,407 excess deaths in wave one however, in wave two overall deaths were below the five-year average by 1,223 deaths (Figure 2).\nSince the announcement of the UK lockdown on 23 March 2020 there have been differing regional lockdown measures implemented across England and Wales. It is important to consider any differences in regional lockdowns when interpreting the data.\nThe highest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 of care home residents in wave one was in the North East (29.9%) and Wales had the highest proportion in wave two (28.8%). This contrasts with non-care home residents (see Glossary), with London reporting the highest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave one (25.5%) and wave two (30.5%).\nThe South West had the lowest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave one (15.9%). In wave two, London had the lowest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 (20.3%) in care home residents. In non-care home residents, the South West had the lowest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in both wave one (6.8%) and wave two (12.3%).\nThe South East had the highest number of excess deaths in care home residents in wave one (4,543 excess deaths) and wave two (841 excess deaths) (Figure 4). The only regions below the five-year average in wave two were the South West (100 fewer deaths), Yorkshire and The Humber (257 fewer deaths), North West (331 fewer deaths), and London (481 fewer deaths).\nIn England and Wales, there was a higher proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 among male (26.6%) than female (22.9%) care home residents (Figure 5).\nThere was a higher proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave two for both male (26.4% in wave one and 26.9% in wave two) and female (21.0% in wave one and 24.9% in wave two) care home residents. \nMale care home residents aged 75 to 79 years had the highest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 of any age group in wave one (29.6%). In wave two, male care home residents aged 80 to 84 years (28.8%) had the highest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 of any age group.\nSimilar to the pattern observed in males, female care home residents aged 75 to 79 years had the highest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave one (24.7%). In wave two, female care home residents aged 85 to 89 years (26.0%) had the highest proportion of deaths involving COVID-19.\nFigures are presented for England and Wales separately in the accompanying dataset.\nThe Office for National Statistics's (ONS's) leading causes of death groupings are based on a list developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This categorises causes of death using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) into groups that are epidemiologically more meaningful than single ICD-10 codes, for the purpose of comparing the most common causes of death in the population.\nCOVID-19 was the leading cause of death in male care home residents in wave one (24.7% of deaths) and wave two (23.9%). Similarly, COVID-19 was the leading cause of death in males in the non-care resident population (15.0% in wave one and 21.5% in wave two).\nDementia and Alzheimer disease remained the leading cause of death for female care home residents in both waves (32.6% in wave one and 31.0% in wave two). COVID-19 was the second leading cause of death (19.5% in wave one and 22.0% in wave two) of female care home residents. This contrasts with non-care home residents where COVID-19 was the leading cause of death of females in wave one (11.4%) and wave two (18.3%).\nEngland and Wales specific breakdowns are available in the accompanying dataset.\nWe analyse pre-existing conditions (see Glossary) where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, among care home residents. A death record can list up to 15 pre-existing conditions so the number of pre-existing conditions maybe higher than the total for deaths. For more detail, please see Measuring pre-existing health conditions in death certification - deaths involving COVID-19.\nOf the care home resident deaths where COVID-19 was the underlying cause, 86.4% (33,228 care home residents) had at least one pre-existing condition with the same proportion being observed in wave one and two (86.4%).\nThe mean number of pre-existing conditions of care home residents was 1.7 in wave one and wave two, compared with a mean of 2.1 pre-existing conditions among non-care home residents in both waves.\nDementia and Alzheimer disease was listed in over half of COVID-19 deaths in male and female care home residents in wave one (50.7% and 52.3%) and just under half of COVID-19 deaths in wave two (49.0% and 49.7% respectively). Compared with non-care home residents where the most common pre-existing condition in COVID-19 deaths in males was diabetes in both waves (25.6% in wave one compared with 25.2% in wave two) and hypertensive diseases for female non-care home residents in wave one and two (22.6% in both waves). \n\nDeaths involving COVID-19 in the care sector, England and Wales Dataset | Released 11 May 2021 Provisional counts of the number of deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) within the care sector registered from 14 March 2020 to 2 April 2021. \n\n\nMore quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in the Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI. The counts of deaths from specific conditions are updated with each weekly publication as the coding of the underlying cause is not always complete at the time of production. The doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death.\nThe information used to produce these statistics is based on details collected when certified deaths are registered with the local registration office. Our statistics are based on what the doctor writes on the death certificate. Doctors use their professional knowledge and judgement to decide what caused or contributed to the death. Their opinion does not have to be based on test results. Using this information, we determine an underlying cause of death. More information on this process can be found in our user guide.\nFigures on deaths published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) differ from those produced by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the UK's public health agencies. Our blog\u202f Counting deaths involving COVID-19 helps to explain the differences.\nDeaths involving COVID-19, including those in the care sector, are reported for each week in our Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional release.\nOur User guide to mortality statistics provides further information on data quality, legislation and procedures relating to mortality and includes a glossary of terms.\nIn England and Wales, deaths should be registered within five days of the death occurring, but there are some situations that result in the registration of the death being delayed. For example, when a death needs to be investigated by a coroner. More information on this issue can be found in our impact of registration delays release.\nFinal death registrations have been used for 2020 data up to week 52. From Week 53 2020 and all 2021 data are provisional. As the data are provisional, they are subject to change.\nWe have used the most up-to-date communal establishment file we have for all data. Therefore, there is some potential for under- and over-coverage within the figures provided.\nThere are some differences in death statistics between countries of the UK, but these are believed to have a negligible impact on comparability.\nBecause of the fluctuations in occupancy rates of care homes as a result of COVID-19 we have been unable to accurately estimate the population for 2021, therefore rates have not been included in this publication.\n", "summary": "Excess deaths in care homes were higher in wave one of the coronavirus pandemic than wave two\nSince the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there were 173,974 deaths of care home residents (wherever the death occurred) in England and Wales. This is a 19.5% increase of the five-year average (145,560 deaths).\nExcess deaths (deaths above the five-average between 2015 and 2019) from all causes were higher in wave one (27,079 excess deaths) than wave two (1,335 excess deaths). This may be due to delayed access to care services and rapid testing during wave one; and lower care home occupancy, vaccine availability and mortality displacement in wave two.\nOf the deaths occurring during the pandemic, 42,341 involved COVID-19, accounting for nearly one in four (24.3%) deaths of care home residents.\nThere were a higher proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave two (25.7%) than wave one (23.1%), however the higher proportion of deaths involving COVID-19 in wave two could be attributed to undiagnosed COVID-19 cases in the first wave.\nWe defined wave one as deaths registered between 14 March and 12 September 2020 and wave two as deaths registered from 12 September 2020 (inclusive) until 2 April 2021.\n", "id": 438}, {"document": "In England, the percentage of people testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) has continued to decrease in the week ending 8 May 2021; we estimate that 40,800 people within the community population in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 31,900 to 50,900), equating to around 1 in 1,340 people.\nIn Wales, the percentage of people testing positive appears to have decreased in the week ending 8 May 2021; we estimate that 700 people in Wales had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 100 to 1,900), equating to around 1 in 4,230 people; the positivity estimate for Wales is currently very low.\nIn Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in the two weeks up to 8 May 2021; we estimate that 1,300 people in Northern Ireland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 300 to 3,000), equating to around 1 in 1,430 people.\nIn Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has continued to decrease in the week ending 8 May 2021; we estimate that 4,200 people in Scotland had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 1,900 to 7,700) equating to around 1 in 1,250 people.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In institutional settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about rates of COVID-19 can be found in our\u00a0latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period.\nAll analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\nEarly management information from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey is\u00a0made available to government decision-makers to inform their response to COVID-19. Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad-hoc or early publications as soon as possible. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding.

Positivity rates are currently very low in Wales, which means that it is difficult to identify trends since they are affected more easily by small changes in the number of people testing positive from week to week. The number of people testing positive in Northern Ireland decreased in the two weeks to 8 May 2021, but the trend for the most recent week is uncertain.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. The ratios presented are rounded to the nearest 10. Because of lower positivity rates caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests and a low number of positives in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\nDownload the data\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understand the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. Information about how the modelled and 14-day non-overlapping estimates are calculated can be found in our\u00a0methods article.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 8 May 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive was observed in Yorkshire and The Humber, although rates were low in all regions and credible intervals are wide.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 8 May 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in Yorkshire and The Humber. The trend is uncertain in the week ending 8 May 2021 in the North West, East Midlands and the South East, but rates appear to have decreased in the two weeks up to 8 May 2021 in these regions. The trend is uncertain in the North East, London, East of England, West Midlands and the South West. In many regions positivity rates are very low so trends will be difficult to identify since they are affected by small changes in the number of people testing positive from week to week.\nDownload the data\nWhen infections are low, it becomes more difficult to break the estimates down into smaller geographic areas. Because of this low positivity, we are not providing sub-regional positivity estimates for the four countries.\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11- to 12-year-olds and 16- to 17-year olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 8 May 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in those aged 35 to 49 years. In the two weeks up to 8 May 2021, rates have decreased for those aged 2 years to school Year 11, however, the trend is uncertain in the most recent week. In the week ending 8 May 2021, the trend is uncertain for all other age groups. The percentage testing positive for those aged 70 years and over is very low. Because of lower positivity rates, caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in the latest trends.\nDownload the data\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 3 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our dataset and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period.\nBecause of lower positivity rates, we are carrying out some additional checks on our estimates of incidence (last published 7 May 2021). Therefore, we will not be updating our incidence estimates in this publication. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nA new variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in the UK in mid-November 2020. The UK variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19 has changes in one of the three genes that coronavirus swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means in cases compatible with the UK variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test.\nOther variants, including B.1.525 (first identified in Nigeria), also have this same pattern of gene positivity. At present these are\u00a0rare in the UK\u00a0so we continue to describe this group as compatible with the UK variant, but we will continue to keep this under review. You can\u00a0read more about the UK variant\u00a0in our blog. The percentage of people testing positive compatible with the UK variant by UK country and regions of England are provided in the accompanying\u00a0technical dataset.\nThe trend in the percentage of people testing positive that are compatible with the UK variant decreased in England and Scotland in the week ending 8 May 2021. In the same week, the trend for both Wales and Northern Ireland was uncertain.\nEach test goes through a number of cycles before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it.\nThe number of cycles is measured as a \"cycle threshold\", known as a\u00a0Ct value. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the\u00a0technical dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus's genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30) - this is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in Office for National Statistics (ONS) data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher). Where we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which virus is which type of variant.\nThese data are provided in the accompanying technical dataset using the international standard labels. For example, the UK variant is B.1.1.7, and the South African variant is B.1.351. We have not seen any of the Manaus variant to date (P.1). We also provide information on viruses where we have found a particular genetic change (mutation) called E484K. This mutation is always seen in the South African variant (B.1.351). Laboratory data suggest that this mutation might make it easier for a virus to infect someone again, or to infect someone who has been vaccinated, but the importance of this is still uncertain.\nThis analysis was produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nThe estimates provided in\u00a0Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on\u00a0sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0methods article\u00a0and our recent\u00a0blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England  Dataset | Released 14 May 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland  Dataset | Released 14 May 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland  Dataset | Released 14 May 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales  Dataset | Released 14 May 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data  Dataset | Released 14 May 2021  Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. \n\n\n \nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.

For more detailed information on our methods you can\u00a0view our COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information. You can also read our article to find out more about\u00a0comparing methods used in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace\u00a0to better understand comparisons in data sources.\nIn this bulletin, we refer to the number of current COVID-19 infections within the community population; community in this instance refers to private residential households and it excludes those in hospitals, care homes and/or other institutional settings. In institutional settings, rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be different. More information about the coronavirus pandemic from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and other sources can be found in our latest insights.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 at a point in time. We use current COVID-19 infections to mean testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with or without having symptoms, on a swab taken from the nose and throat. This is different to the incidence rate, which is a measure of only the new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. All analysis was produced with our research partners at the University of Oxford.\n\nMore information on COVID-19 and taking part in our survey   For more information, please visit the\u00a0CIS participant guidance\u00a0page.

Occasionally we may publish figures early if it is considered in the public interest. We will ensure that we pre-announce any ad hoc or early publications as soon as we can. These will include supporting information where possible to aid user understanding. This is consistent with guidance from the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR).\nThe data can be used for:\nestimating the number of current positive cases in the community, including cases where people do not report having any symptoms\nidentifying differences in numbers of positive cases between different regions\nestimating the number of new cases and change over time in positive cases\nThe data cannot be used for:\nmeasuring the number of cases and infections in care homes, hospitals and/or other institutional settings\nproviding information about recovery time of those infected\nIn the week ending 31 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) decreased in England, Wales, and Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the percentage testing positive continued to increase in the week ending 31 July 2021.\nThese estimates are based on statistical modelling of the trend in rates of positive nose and throat swab results. All our estimates are subject to uncertainty given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Therefore, caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trends.\n\n!\n\nBecause of the relatively small number of tests in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in our sample, credible intervals are wide and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. These wide credible intervals mean that differences between the central estimates within and between nations may appear smaller or more exaggerated than they really are. \n\n\n\n.XLSX\nOur headline estimates of the percentage of people testing positive in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are the latest official estimates. We include different measures to support our estimation and this section outlines the appropriate uses of all the approaches.\nOfficial estimates should be used to understand the positivity rate for a single point in time. This is based on the modelled estimate for the latest week and is our best and most stable estimate, used in all previous outputs. The modelled estimate is more suited to understanding the recent trend. This is because the model is regularly updated to include new test results and smooths the trend over time. These modelled estimates can be found in the accompanying datasets.\nThe estimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled official estimates) and the unweighted sample counts are included in the accompanying datasets. These estimates are produced using a different method of weighting to the model and are available for people who wish to compare infection levels over time in this way. For more information on our methods and quality surrounding the estimates please see our methods article and Quality and Methodology Information report.\nAll estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional results. As swabs are not necessarily analysed in date order by the laboratory, we have not yet received test results for all swabs taken on the dates included in this analysis. Estimates may therefore be revised as more test results are included.\nThe overall national picture for England is a result of the trends across regions. During the week ending 31 July 2021, the highest percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) was observed in the North East of England.\n\n!\n\nIn the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each region who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was low relative to England overall. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the regional estimates for this period, as indicated by larger credible intervals. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 31 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive decreased in the North West, East Midlands, West Midlands, London and the South East. For the North East, Yorkshire and The Humber, the South West and East of England, the trend is uncertain for the most recent week ending 31 July 2021. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend. \n.XLSX\nWhen the percentage of people testing positive is low, sub-regional estimates are subject to increased uncertainty as captured in the credible intervals.\n\n!\n\nSub-regional estimates are based on a different model to our headline estimates and should not be compared. In the data used to produce these estimates, the number of people sampled in each sub-regional area who tested positive was lower relative to their respective overall national samples. This means there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates and caution should be taken when interpreting or ranking them. \n\n\n\nThe percentage testing positive varies across sub-regions of the UK. In Figure 3, we have presented modelled estimates from 25 to 31 July 2021 for sub-regions in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales is currently not included as it has the lowest number of infections compared with other UK countries, which results in greater uncertainty in the sub-regional estimates.\n.XLSX\nOur age categories separate children and young people by school age:\n\"age two years to school Year 6\" includes those children in primary school and below\n\"school Year 7 to school Year 11\" includes those children in secondary school\n\"school Year 12 to age 24 years\" includes those young adults who may be in further or higher education\nThis means that 11 to 12-year-olds and 16 to 17-year-olds have been split between different age categories depending on whether their birthday is before or after 1 September.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the\u00a0accompanying dataset. \n\n\n\nIn the week ending 31 July 2021, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased for those between School Year 12 and 49 years and those aged 70 years and over. For those aged 2 years to School Year 11 and those aged 50 to 69 years, the trends are uncertain. \n.XLSX\nWe are unable to produce the same grouped analysis as presented in Figure 4 for the devolved administrations because of smaller sample sizes within each age group. We are able to produce analysis on positivity by single year of age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland using a different model and these estimates can be found in the following section and datasets that accompany this bulletin.\nEstimates for non-overlapping 14-day periods (which underpin our modelled estimates) by age group are available in our accompanying dataset and are provided as an alternative measure over time for context.\nIn this section we present modelled daily estimates of the percentage testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age over time for all four UK countries: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from 20 June to 31 July 2021. These estimates use a different method to the grouped age analysis presented previously and are therefore not comparable.\n\n!\n\nEstimates are based on smaller sample sizes within each age group relative to England overall. There is a higher degree of uncertainty as indicated by larger credible intervals. These can be found in the accompanying dataset. \n\n\n\nFurther analysis on age for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland is published by their respective statistical agencies. Analysis for Wales is published in English and Welsh.\nFigure 5 shows the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 by single year of age from 20 June to 31 July 2021, for each of the four UK countries. Because of lower positivity rates during some of this period, caution should be taken in over-interpreting small movements in positivity day to day.\n.XLSX\nThe incidence rate is a measure of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases in a given time period. We include estimates of the incidence rate in our accompanying datasets.\nIn the week ending 14 July 2021, the number of new PCR-positive COVID-19 cases appeared to have levelled off in England, increased in Northern Ireland, and continued to decrease in Scotland. The trend for Wales was uncertain. Credible intervals are very wide because of relatively small sample sizes, and care should be taken in interpreting results.\nThe reference date used for our official estimates of incidence of PCR-positive cases is 14 days prior to the end of the positivity reference week, meaning that there is a two-week lag between the incidence estimate and the positivity estimate. This is necessary as estimates later than this date are more likely to change as we receive additional data. While we believe that the incidence estimates are useful, they can be volatile and subject to change as more data become available. This is particularly the case with the most recent estimates, so it is important to be cautious when using them. When incidence is low, it may not be possible to produce a reliable estimate. In these instances we recommend focusing on the upper credible interval, which gives an upper bound to the incidence of new infections. For more information on how we calculate estimates of incidence please see\u00a0COVID-19 Infection Survey: methods and further information.\nSince the end of May, infections compatible with the Delta variant have been the most common in England and, in recent weeks, all four UK countries. This was last measured as 99% percent of all COVID-19 infections (in the four weeks to 18 July). \nBecause of this high proportion of a single variant, we have not included breakdown of infections by variant. We last published our main variant analysis in our\u00a0Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 23 July 2021, where more details can be found.\nWe will continue to monitor infections by variant and will reintroduce the charts and analysis by gene matching pattern when considered helpful.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) have defined names for\u00a0Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest.\nVariants of concern are:\nAlpha: Variant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK. Beta: Variant B.1.351, first identified in South Africa. Gamma: Variant P.1, first identified in Brazil Delta: Variant B.1.617.2, first identified in India.\nVariants of interest are:\nEta: Variant B.1.525, first identified in multiple countries. Iota: Variant B.1.526, first identified in Unites States of America. Kappa: B.1.617.1, first identified in India. Lamda: C.37, first identified in Peru.\nThe Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of coronavirus (COVID-19) identified in the UK in mid-November 2020 has changes in one of the three genes that COVID-19 swab tests detect, known as the S-gene. This means that in cases compatible with this variant, the S-gene is not detected by the current test. Therefore Alpha (B.1.1.7) has the pattern ORF1ab+N (S-gene negative) in our main variant analysis.\nOther variants - including both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Beta (B.1.351) - are positive on all three genes, with the pattern ORF1ab+S+N. Almost all ORF1ab+S+N cases in the UK will now be the Delta variant, so this group is labelled \"compatible with the Delta variant\".\nThe Ct value is the number of cycles that each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test goes through before a positive result is detectable. If there is a high quantity of the virus present, a positive result will be identified after a low number of cycles. However, if there is only a small amount of the virus present, then it will take more cycles to detect it. These values are used as a proxy for the quantity of the virus, also known as the viral load. The higher the viral load, the lower the Ct value. These values are helpful for monitoring the strength of the virus and for identifying patterns that could suggest changes in the way the virus is transmitting. The Ct values of COVID-19 positive tests are provided in the technical dataset\u00a0that accompanies this bulletin.\nWe try to read all letters of the virus' genetic material for every positive nose and throat swab with sufficient virus to do so (Ct less than 30). This is called whole genome sequencing. Positive samples are hand-picked at the testing centre and shipped to a sequencing lab, after which they are sequenced and the genetic data processed. Sequencing is not successful on all these samples, or only part of the genome is sequenced. This is especially so for the higher Ct values, which are common in our data as we often catch people early or late in infection when viral loads tend to be lower (and hence Ct values are higher).\nWhere we successfully sequence over half of the genome, we use the sequence data to work out which type of variant is present in each virus. This method can tell us which variant might be responsible for any potential increase in cases which are either \"compatible with the Delta variant\" or \"compatible with the Alpha variant\". However, because we cannot get a sequence from every positive result, there is more uncertainty in these estimates.\nThese data are provided in the\u00a0accompanying technical dataset\u00a0using the international standard labels.\nGenome sequencing takes longer to produce results, so the genome sequencing results relate to an earlier time period than our most recent positivity data. Our most recent results from genome sequencing show that in the four weeks up to the week ending 18 July 2021, the majority (99%) of sequences obtained were Delta (B.1.617.2).\nThis analysis is produced by research partners at the University of Oxford. Of particular note are Dr Katrina Lythgoe, Dr David Bonsall, Dr Tanya Golubchik, and Dr Helen Fryer.\nMore information on how we measure variants from positive tests on the survey can be found in our\u00a0blog.\nThe estimates provided in Sections 2 to 6 are for the percentage of the private-residential population testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), otherwise known as the positivity rate. We do not report the prevalence rate. To calculate the prevalence rate, we would need an accurate understanding of the swab test's sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate).\nWhile we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, our data and related studies provide an indication of what these are likely to be. In particular, the data suggest that the false-positive rate is very low - under 0.005%. We do not know the sensitivity of the swab test. However, other studies suggest that sensitivity (the rate of true-positive test results) may be somewhere between 85% and 98%.\nYou can find more information on sensitivity and specificity in our\u00a0methods article\u00a0and our recent\u00a0blog. You can find more information on the data suggesting that our test's false-positive rate is very low in a\u00a0paper written by academic partners\u00a0at the University of Oxford.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: England  Dataset | Released 6 August 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for England.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Northern Ireland  Dataset | Released 6 August 2021 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Northern Ireland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Scotland  Dataset | Released 6 August 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Scotland.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: Wales  Dataset | Released 6 August 2021  Findings from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey for Wales.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey: technical data  Dataset | Released 6 August 20211  Technical and methodological data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\n\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey analysis was produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with our research partners at the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England (PHE) and Wellcome Trust.
