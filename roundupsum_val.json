Those who tested positive could end self-isolation after five full days, following two negative lateral flow tests (LFTs) taken 24 hours apart on days five and six of their self-isolation. Respondents in this survey will have been subject to these rules.\nMore information on identifying this group of people and collecting the data can be found in the\u00a0Glossary\u00a0and\u00a0Measuring the data\u00a0sections.\nTwo-thirds of respondents (67%) fully understood self-isolation guidance regarding permitted reasons to leave the home. Adherence among those who fully understood the guidance (84%) was statistically significantly higher compared with those who misunderstood or were unsure on self-isolation guidance (72%).\nMost respondents (97%) reported that they were fully aware of the new isolation guidance. Of those who were aware, 88% took an LFT on days five and six of their isolation; of these, 73% tested positive in at least one LFT. \nSince 11 January 2022, people living in England who tested positive for COVID-19 with an LFT were no longer required to confirm they were positive with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Exceptions to this rule included those who wished to apply for a payment through the NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme. Other exceptions are on the gov.uk website.\nAlmost 9 in 10 (86%) respondents were aware of this policy change; however, of these, 34% still reported taking a PCR test. Of those who were aware of the policy change and took a PCR test, 90% did not apply for payment through the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme.\nGovernment guidance advises that to be classified as fully vaccinated, you need to have two doses of a recognised vaccine. Almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents thought that they needed a booster to be fully vaccinated.\nOn 24 February 2022, the self-isolation advice for people in England who tested positive for COVID-19 changed. The legal requirement to self-isolate following a positive test was removed. Until 1 April 2022, adults and children who test positive continue to be advised to stay home and avoid contact with other people for at least five full days, and to follow the guidance until they have received two negative tests results on consecutive days. Respondents in this survey were not subject to these new rules.\nAround 7 in 10 (72%) respondents reported that they would continue to self-isolate if they became infected with COVID-19, even if it were no longer a legal requirement. This was statistically significantly higher among respondents who agreed that COVID-19 poses a risk to either themselves personally, one or more of their friends and family, or society (73%), compared with those who disagree (34%). This percentage is based on sample counts of less than 30 and should be treated with caution.\nFrom 1 April 2022, the government will no longer provide free universal symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public in England.\nWhen respondents were asked whether they would take a COVID-19 test if they had to buy one, 63% agreed that they would. There was no significant difference between those in the most deprived areas (59%) who agreed that they would pay for a test, and those in the least deprived areas (64%) who agreed that they would pay for a test.\nApproximately one-third (35%) of those who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) reported that self-isolation had a negative effect on their well-being and mental health. The average (mean) life satisfaction for those who tested positive (all respondents) was 7.9 out of 10.0. Most respondents (96%) reported that they did not experience difficulties preventing them from self-isolating or getting a test.\nFrom 24 February 2022, workers were no longer legally obliged to tell their employers that they are required to self-isolate. From 24 March 2022, coronavirus provisions within the Statutory Sick Pay and Employment and Support Allowance regulations will end; however, people with COVID-19 may still be eligible, subject to the normal conditions of entitlement. As this survey is based on those who began isolation on 1 and 4 February 2022, this policy change does not affect respondents in this survey.\nOf respondents who were in full-time, part-time, or unpaid employment, or receiving sick pay or unpaid leave from work, most (98%) reported their employer was aware that they had to self-isolate. Of those testing positive for COVID-19 who were not retired, 24% reported they lost income because of isolation, and 16% reported that self-isolating meant they were likely to lose their job or miss out on work. Those who were not double-vaccinated were statistically significantly more likely to have lost income because of self-isolation (46%), compared with those with two or more coronavirus vaccine doses (23%). The previous percentage is based on sample counts of less than 30 and should be treated with caution.\nMost respondents (94%) did not apply for a payment through the NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme. Of respondents who did not apply, 66% said they were aware of the scheme but not eligible for it, and a further 20% reported they were not aware of the scheme.\nNotes\nCoronavirus and self-isolation after testing positive in England Dataset | Released 26 January 2022 Behaviour of individuals required to self-isolate after testing positive for COVID-19, from the COVID Test and Trace Cases Insights Survey.

Experimental Statistics. \nSelf-isolation refers to not leaving your home because you have, or might have, coronavirus (COVID-19). It is a legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive for COVID-19. In addition to staying at home, if you are self-isolating, you should not have visitors unless the purpose of the visit is to provide essential care. At the time of data collection, your self-isolation period includes the day your symptoms started (or the day you had the positive test result if you do not have symptoms) and the next 5 to 10 full days. If you still have symptoms after 10 days, you must continue self-isolating until they are gone.\nMore information can be found\u00a0in the\u00a0NHS guidance on when and how to self-isolate.\nOn 22 December 2021, the self-isolation advice for people in England who tested positive for COVID-19 changed. Those who tested positive could end self-isolation after seven days, following two negative lateral flow tests (LFTs) taken 24 hours apart on days six and seven of their self-isolation.\nAs of 17 January 2022, the self-isolation period was reduced to five days, on the condition that the individual has two negative LFTs taken on days five and six and does not have a high temperature.\nOn 24 February 2022, the self-isolation advice for people in England who tested positive for COVID-19 changed. The legal requirement to self-isolate following a positive test was removed. Until 1 April 2022, adults and children who test positive continue to be advised to stay home and avoid contact with other people for at least five full days, and to follow the guidance until they have received two negative test results on consecutive days. Respondents in this survey were not subject to these rules.\nMore information can be found\u00a0in\u00a0Self-isolation for COVID-19 cases reduced from 10 days to 7 days following negative Lateral Flow Device (LFD) tests\u00a0and\u00a0Self-isolation for those with COVID-19 can end after 5 full days following 2 negative LFD tests.\nSymptoms that require an individual to self-isolate prior to a positive test result are a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste.\nSymptoms reported by respondents that do not require self-isolation if experienced without a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste are:\nThe term \"significant\" refers to statistically significant changes or differences. Significance has been determined using the 95% confidence intervals, where instances of non-overlapping confidence intervals between estimates indicate the difference is unlikely to have arisen from random fluctuation.

The 11th wave of data was collected between 7 and 12 February 2022. The number of respondents was 1,006.\nRespondents were sampled through the Contact Tracing and Advisory Service (CTAS) database, held by NHS Test and Trace, using implicit stratification. Respondents were aged 18 years and over, had tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) and reached day six of their self-isolation period between 7 and 12 February 2022.\nThe majority (96%) of respondents were interviewed between six and nine days after starting their self-isolation. The remaining 4% of respondents were interviewed between 10 and 11 days after starting their self-isolation.\nOf the potential respondents who were successfully contacted by an interviewer, the response rate was 64%. When including cases where contact was attempted but not made, the response rate was 18%.\nA low response rate can be expected, because the target population may have been unwell with COVID-19, and therefore less likely to participate.\nPercentages in this report are based on weighted counts that are representative of the population of adults (aged 18 years and over) who had tested positive for COVID-19 and began their self-isolation period between 10 January to 6 February 2022.\nThe statistics presented are Experimental Statistics, so care needs to be taken when interpreting them. The survey has a relatively small number of respondents (1,006) and the behaviour of respondents during self-isolation is self-reported.\nInformation on the strengths and limitations of this survey are available in the\u00a0Coronavirus and self-isolation after testing positive in England methodology.\nCoronavirus and self-isolation after testing positive in England methodology Methodology article | Released 4 May 2021 Latest quality and methodology information on data from the COVID Test and Trace Cases Insights Survey and its use to examine the adherence to self-isolation guidelines.

It brings together data from a range of different organisations to create a more coherent picture of how victims and perpetrators of domestic abuse interact with the criminal justice system and support services. It has been produced, working in collaboration with, and using data sources from:\nUp-to-date statistics, and other commentary discussing domestic abuse in England and Wales, can be found in the most recent Domestic abuse in England and Wales overview. \nThroughout the release we present both official statistics and National Statistics. National Statistics are a subset of official statistics that have been certified by the UK Statistics Authority as compliant with its Code of Practice for Statistics.\nData from the following sources are classified as National Statistics:\nData from the following sources are classified as official statistics:\nOther data included are from administrative datasets that do not fall within the scope of official statistics. \nThis publication presents the stages of the criminal justice process in England and Wales for cases of domestic abuse. It describes how the data are captured at each stage of the process and provides important information about each data source. It should be viewed alongside the other publications and data in this release to aid understanding.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of how cases of domestic abuse are captured and flow through the criminal justice system. The following sections of this publication provide detailed information on each stage of the process and the data sources available. Data from the criminal justice system are discussed in the latest Domestic abuse and the criminal justice system publication. For detailed definitions of terms referred to throughout this publication see the Glossary.\nFollowing a single or repeated occurrence of domestic abuse, a victim may choose to tell someone or seek support. Alternatively, a third party (relative, friend, professional) may report on the victim\u2019s behalf either with or without their knowledge.\nIn cases where a victim chooses not to report the matter to the police or to other domestic abuse services, the victim remains hidden from the police and the criminal justice system.\nFor cases where a victim does not report abuse to the police or to other domestic abuse services, they may be included in the statistics produced from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). The CSEW is a victimisation survey which asks people about their experiences of a range of crimes irrespective of whether they reported them to the police. A description of, and methodological information about, the face-to-face CSEW are available within the User guide to crime statistics and the Domestic abuse quality and methodology information (QMI) report.\nThe face-to-face CSEW was suspended on 17 March 2020 because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) replaced the CSEW and was specifically designed to allow us to continue measuring crime during this period. However, concerns around confidentiality and respondent safeguarding limited the types of questions asked in the TCSEW, specifically those relating to domestic abuse. As a result, CSEW and TCSEW data and estimates are not available in the Domestic abuse in England and Wales: November 2021 publication. Further information about the TCSEW can be found in section 2.1 of the User guide to crime in England and Wales: measuring crime during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nSome victims seek help from support services or are referred to services by another agency, for example, health services. This can occur whether the case comes to the attention of the police or not. In cases which do come to the attention of the police, the victim may be referred to support services by the police. Alternatively, the victim may have reported the incident to the police following an interaction with support services.\nIn the Domestic abuse release we present a selection of data on the provision of domestic abuse victim services in England and Wales. These data are collected and held by a range of charities, and cover topics such as the availability of services and characteristics of service users.\nServices data included are provided by:\nThese data are sourced from non-governmental, administrative datasets and are not classified as official statistics. Data on domestic abuse services reflect support offered to victims that become visible to these services.\nThe first recording stage in the criminal justice process begins when the police receive a report of an incident of domestic abuse. An incident can be reported to the police by victims, members of the public, or can be referred by a police officer or a \u201cthird party\u201d, including professionals such as NHS staff and social workers. \nDomestic abuse-related incidents cover reports of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults, aged 16 years and over, who are or have been intimate partners or family members (regardless of gender or sexuality). The police, at this stage, will either:\nThe Home Office provides data on the number of domestic abuse-related incidents. To get a better picture of the demand upon the police that relates to domestic abuse, it is necessary to consider both domestic abuse-related incidents and crimes.\nWhen the police record a report of domestic abuse as an incident, they must then assess whether or not an offence has been committed in accordance with the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS)1.\nFor cases that are recorded first as an incident, there are two possible outcomes. If it is concluded that a crime did not take place, the domestic abuse incident remains recorded as an incident. Alternatively, a crime, identified as domestic abuse-related, may be recorded in addition to the incident.\nNot all reported crimes are recorded as an incident first. If it is clear when the incident is reported that an offence has occurred, the police may record the matter as a domestic abuse-related crime immediately without first recording an incident.\nIf it is concluded that an offence has been committed, either immediately when reported, or after being recorded as an incident, the matter will be recorded as a crime and will be identified as domestic abuse-related. \nThe Home Office is responsible for the collation of recorded crime data supplied by the 43 territorial police forces of England and Wales, plus the British Transport Police1.\nOffences that are domestic abuse-related will be recorded under the respective offence that has been committed, for example, assault with injury. This is because (with the exception of controlling or coercive behaviour) domestic abuse is not currently a specific criminal offence. \nThe Home Office has been collecting information from the police on whether recorded offences are related to domestic abuse since April 20152, but it is not possible to determine how many crimes were domestic abuse-related prior to this date. This system relies on the police identifying offences as domestic abuse-related and it is possible that some offences may not be correctly identified.\nDomestic abuse-related crimes include \u201ccontrolling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship\u201d3. Controlling or coercive behaviour was introduced as a specific criminal offence as part of the Serious Crime Act 2015 and came into force on 29 December 20154. \nWhere data on domestic abuse-related crimes have been analysed by age and sex of the victim, data from the Home Office Data Hub5 are used. \nIn addition to domestic abuse-related crimes, the Home Office also provides data on domestic homicides. These data are extracted from the Homicide Index which contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by the police in England and Wales. It is continually updated with revised information from the police and the courts and, as such, is a richer source of data than the main recorded crime dataset6. \nHomicides are recorded to be \u201cdomestic\u201d when the relationship between a victim aged 16 years and over, and the perpetrator falls into one of the following categories:\nThese data exclude homicides where the victim was aged under 16 years, to be consistent with the government definition of domestic abuse used elsewhere in the release.\nHomicide Index data are based on the year when the offence was recorded, not when the offence took place or when the case was heard in court. While in the majority of cases the offence will be recorded in the same year as it took place, this is not always the case. The data refer to the position as at a specific point in time, when the Homicide Index database is \u201cfrozen\u201d for the purpose of analysis7. This will be stated alongside the findings throughout the release. The data may change as subsequent court hearings take place or as other information is received.\nAnalysis on data from the Homicide Index combines data for a three-year period to account for the year-to-year variability in the volume of homicides. Data on the number of domestic homicides by sex can be broken down by police force area but there is considerable volatility in these numbers over time because of the relatively low volumes involved. See the tables accompanying the release for more information. \nThe Home Office also provides police recorded crime data on stalking and harassment offences identified as domestic abuse-related. Stalking and harassment offences include harassment, malicious communications, racially or religiously aggravated harassment, and stalking.\nThe 2017 report from Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), Living in fear \u2013 the police and CPS response to harassment and stalking (PDF, 957.7KB), highlights issues with police forces not recording offences of stalking and harassment cases accurately. HMICFRS found that some stalking and harassment incidents reported to the police were not recorded at all, and when incidents were recorded as crimes, stalking was often misidentified as harassment.\nOnce a domestic abuse-related crime is recorded, the police then conduct an investigation which aims to collect all evidence relevant to the case and identify a suspect. Following investigation, the police will assign an outcome to the offence:\nSuspect charged following referral of case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS): in these cases, the police charge a suspect with an offence relating to domestic abuse following a decision by the CPS.\nCase transferred: when, after further investigation, it becomes apparent that the offence took place in another police force area, this would lead to a crime being transferred to that police force for the investigation to be continued8.\nNo suspect is identified so case cannot proceed: although very rare for domestic abuse cases, sometimes the investigation does not identify a suspect (as the victim may be unwilling to give details); as such, the case does not proceed.\nSuspect receives an out of court disposal, for example a caution: in some exceptional cases, the police may issue the suspect with a caution.\nCrime report is cancelled: where, after further investigation, the police decide that a crime has not taken place and subsequently, the crime report is cancelled.\nDecision that no further action will be taken: in some cases the police may decide that there is not enough evidence to take the case forward and take no further action; another example of when the police may be unable to pursue an investigation is where the offender has died before the case could be investigated or prosecuted.\nOnce the police have recorded a crime, they may arrest a suspect. HMICFRS collect data from police forces on arrests, bails and voluntary attendances for domestic abuse-related crimes9. The latest update report (PDF, 1047KB) by HMICFRS highlights concerns over the variation in arrest rates across police forces.\nPolice recorded crime data on outcomes of domestic abuse-related and non domestic abuse-related crimes are from the Home Office Data Hub. These data also provide information on the time taken to assign an outcome. \nFor more information on how police forces submit their data to the Home Office, please refer to Section 3.1 of the User guide to crime statistics.\nIn response to a recommendation in the Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) 2014 report Everyone\u2019s business: Improving the police response to domestic abuse, police forces are asked to \u201cidentify\u201d crimes as being domestic abuse-related if the offence meets the government definition of domestic violence and abuse.\nThis offence is constituted by behaviour on the part of the perpetrator, which takes place \u201crepeatedly or continuously\u201d. The victim and alleged perpetrator must be \u201cpersonally connected\u201d at the time the behaviour takes place. The behaviour must have had a \u201cserious effect\u201d on the victim, meaning that it has caused the victim to fear violence will be used against them on \u201cat least two occasions\u201d, or it has had a \u201csubstantial adverse effect on the victims\u2019 day-to-day activities\u201d. The alleged perpetrator must have known that their behaviour would have a serious effect on the victim, or the behaviour must have been such that he or she \u201cought to have known\u201d it would have that effect.\nThis offence is included in the Home Office Counting Rules, under the category of \u201cAssault without injury\u201d.\nThis is an improved record-level data collection system designed to streamline the process by which forces submit data. Migration of forces to the Data Hub is ongoing.\nFor example, when the police initially record an offence as a homicide it remains classified as such unless the police or courts decide that a lesser offence, or no offence, took place. The offence would be reclassified on the Homicide Index as \u201cno longer recorded\u201d but remain in the main police recorded crime collection as a homicide.\nThe Homicide Index is continually updated with revised information from the police as investigations continue and as cases are heard by the courts. The version used for analysis does not accept updates after it is \u201cfrozen\u201d to ensure the data do not change during the analysis period. See Section 3.1 of the User guide to crime statistics for more information.\nThere are strict guidelines to which the police must adhere to in order to transfer or cancel a crime report (please refer to the Home Office Counting Rules for further information).\nVoluntary attendances act as an alternative to arrest where the suspect attends a police station voluntarily to assist with investigation. Not all forces are able to provide data on the number of arrests, bails and voluntary attendances for domestic abuse-related crimes. \nDuring the investigation, some victims (for a wide variety of reasons) may decide not to support the police in their enquiries. Although this often means that it is more difficult for any further action to be taken by the police, the case will continue to be progressed if possible. \nEvidence-led prosecutions are an option considered by the police and may be taken up by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). This means that, even in cases where a victim is unwilling to appear in court as a witness, it does not necessarily prevent the suspect being subject to a trial.\nIn cases where the victim does not support a police investigation or prosecution, the offence remains recorded. In such cases, the police may suggest ways the victim can seek support through the criminal justice process, or from specialist support agencies or organisations. Where the victim still does not support the investigation or prosecution, the police and the CPS will review all the evidence in the case to determine if the case can continue without the evidence of the victim. Where the Code for Crown Prosecutors is still satisfied, the crime will proceed to court. If there is insufficient evidence, or if it is not in the public interest to prosecute, the case cannot continue regardless of how serious it is.\nTo support a victim through the trial process, the CPS can ask the court to allow a victim or a witness in the case to use a variety of \u201cspecial measures\u201d. These can include giving evidence behind screens or from another room or location using a video link. Where the case is reliant on the evidence of the victim, the CPS may ask the court to compel the witness to attend court by issuing a witness summons. However, this will only occur after the police have carried out a full risk assessment and detailed enquiries have been made with any specialist support agencies who are providing assistance to the victim.\nThe police can request advice from the CPS on domestic abuse cases before referring them to the CPS for charging1. The police may make a request for informal advice without submitting a file, which can take place in person or over the telephone. Informal advice is sought if the matter is straightforward and does not require the formal submission of papers. Such advice would be generic, on general points of law and not case specific. An appropriate audit trail is required for any case-specific enquiries and advice that the police may take in investigating a case.\nThe CPS is the principal prosecuting authority for England and Wales, acting independently in criminal cases investigated by the police and others. The CPS can only consider cases that are referred to them by the police or other investigators. Specifically, with regard to domestic abuse, the CPS:\nThe Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the principles to be followed by Crown Prosecutors when they make case decisions. The CPS does not determine guilt; this is a matter for the court to decide on the facts of a case as presented. The CPS aims to build the strongest possible cases on the available evidence to assist the jury in this task.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant impacts on the CPS and the entire criminal justice system. The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in reduced court activity, causing a rise in live caseload per Prosecutor and a backlog of cases awaiting time in court. Caution should be exercised in making comparisons with previous years.\nThis has had a significant impact on the CPS and the entire criminal justice system, particularly on the number of prosecutions being finalised. \nPlease see the Crown Prosecution Service annual report 2020 to 2021 for more information.\nPolice referrals to the CPS for a decision to charge a suspect are sometimes referred to as pre-charge receipts, and are the most frequent interaction between the police and the CPS. In some circumstances, a case referred to the CPS may require further evidence to be obtained before a charge decision can be made. If this is the case, the Prosecutor will advise the officer of the further material required to obtain a charging decision by way of a targeted and specific action plan.\nWhere the police believe that a domestic abuse case could proceed to charge, the decision to charge is made by the CPS and not the police. \nCPS data are available through its Case Management System (CMS) and associated Management Information System (MIS)2. The CPS collects data to assist in the effective management of its prosecution functions and therefore does not collect data that constitute official statistics as defined in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007.\nCPS domestic abuse data are dependent upon lawyers and administrative staff correctly identifying applicable cases and flagging the case on the CMS. These data are accurate only to the extent that flags have been correctly applied.\nFor CPS data, a domestic abuse flag may be applied at the beginning of a case, or later in the prosecution process if a domestic abuse relationship becomes apparent. There is a time lag between every stage of the criminal justice process \u2013 from police referral to the CPS for charging, prosecution, conviction and sentencing. For example, a domestic abuse case could be referred to the CPS in one year, but a conviction may not be secured until a later year. As a result, the data presented in this release on referrals, prosecutions and convictions do not necessarily follow on from each other and caution should be taken when making comparisons3.\nCPS data include both child and adult defendant and victim data. This does not strictly align with the government definition of domestic abuse, which only applies to those cases where both the victim and perpetrator are aged 16 years and over. CPS data also cover stalking and harassment offences flagged as domestic abuse-related, and controlling or coercive behaviour offences. The data also include offences involving the \u201cdisclosure of private sexual photographs and films with the intent to cause distress or anxiety\u201d, commonly referred to as \u201crevenge porn\u201d. This was made a specific criminal offence in April 20154. \nCPS pre-charge data covers those cases, by suspect, referred to the CPS by the police for a charging decision. The CMS data report the average number of calendar days since the first decision was sought by the police, to the date in which the last decision made was to charge. The data include those cases where the police were required to submit further evidence prior to a decision to charge being made. The data also include more serious complex cases including those involving a death, rape and serious sexual offences, child abuse, large-scale or long-term fraud, and cases with substantial or complex video or audio key evidence. These must all be referred to CPS area-based prosecutors.\nIt is not possible within the system to separately record the timeliness of cases subject to advice and further work before a charge decision was made and recorded as the last decision.\nThe data include all cases where the decision was made on the same day by CPS Direct, and cases that must be referred to CPS area-based prosecutors by way of face-to-face, telephone, or written advice and consultation with the police.\nThere can be a delay between the commencement of new offences and cases coming through to court. This is primarily as a result of the time it takes for an offence to be investigated, the police to assign an outcome, the prosecution, and to result in a completed court case.\nThe Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the conditions that must be met for a prosecution to take place5. There are two stages to this: the evidential stage and the public interest stage.\nThe evidential stage requires that the CPS must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each defendant on each charge. This finding is based on the Prosecutor\u2019s objective assessment of the evidence. It must also be in the public interest to prosecute the offence and the offender. It means that an objective, impartial and reasonable jury, bench of magistrates or judge hearing a case alone, properly directed and acting in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged. This is a different test from that applied by the criminal courts where a court may only convict if it is sure that the defendant is guilty.\nIn circumstances where a victim is not willing to support a prosecution, when considering public interest, prosecutors will give careful consideration to a number of factors. These can include the seriousness of the offence, the interests and safety of the victim, other family members and any children or other dependants, the culpability and maturity of the defendant, and any other factors that may present as relevant to public interest.\nIn every case where there is sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution, prosecutors must go on to consider whether a prosecution is required in the public interest. A prosecution will usually take place unless the Prosecutor is satisfied that there are public interest factors tending against prosecution, which outweigh those tending in favour. In the case of domestic abuse, it will be rare for the public interest stage not to be met.\nCriminal justice outcomes data on controlling or coercive behaviour offences are available from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).\nCriminal court data are primarily published on a principal offences basis, meaning that where proceedings involve more than one offence, the principal offence is reported. The MoJ publishes experimental data that show the combination of offences for which defendants were prosecuted.\nMoJ data refer to a different time period to prosecutions data published by the CPS, and relate to the disposals for offenders of controlling or coercive behaviour, rather than offences heard at a magistrates\u2019 court6. As a result, data from the CPS and MoJ are not directly comparable.\nAs with CPS data, there can be a delay between the commencement of new offences and cases coming through to court, primarily as a result of the time it takes for an offence to be investigated, the police to assign an outcome, the prosecution, and to result in a completed court case. \nFor more information, see CPS Relations with the Police.\nThe CPS collects data to assist in the effective management of its prosecution functions and therefore does not collect data that constitute official statistics as defined in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007.\nNote the percentage of cases charged covers those domestic abuse cases, by suspect, forwarded to CPS during a given year for charging decisions and are not directly comparable in numbers with those prosecuted, which covers cases, by defendant, finalised during the same year. One defendant may have committed a number of offences, usually, although not exclusively, against one victim.\nThese offences are included within the offence category of \u201charassment\u201d under the Home Office Counting Rules.\nAdditional information and support for prosecutors to enable them to make decisions in cases involving domestic abuse can be found in Domestic Abuse Guidelines for Prosecutors.\nA defendant who appears before both magistrates\u2019 court and Crown Court may not do so within the same year, meaning for a given year convictions may exceed prosecutions or sentences may not equal convictions. Defendants who appear before both courts may be convicted at the Crown Court for a different offence to that for which they were originally proceeded against at magistrates\u2019 court.\nOnce a prosecution has taken place, there are two main outcomes: the defendant is not convicted, or the defendant is convicted.\nThe CPS reviews every case they receive from the police. Review is a continuous process and prosecutors must take account of any change in circumstances that occurs as the case develops, including what becomes known of the defence case.\nWhere circumstances have changed, sometimes there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction, or it may no longer be in the public interest to prosecute. In those circumstances a case may be discontinued, that is, stopped from proceeding further. \nIf the defendant pleads guilty or is found guilty by a jury, they will be sentenced by the judge or by the magistrates.\nRegardless of whether the defendant is convicted or not, the court can make a restraining order in appropriate cases. \nData on prosecutions, convictions, and other outcomes of charging decisions are provided by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). These data include reasons for non-convictions. Prosecutions data cover domestic abuse-related cases, by defendant, finalised during a specified year1.\nData showing the sex of defendants are held in the CPS Management Information System, however, the records are not always complete. The sex of the defendant is unknown in some cases and may not be recorded in others. \nThe Ministry of Justice are responsible for publishing data from the family courts (with data collected by Her Majesty\u2019s Courts and Tribunals Service through the FamilyMan database) which include orders to prevent domestic violence.\nTwo types of domestic violence remedy order can be granted by the family courts:\na non-molestation order, which can either prohibit particular behaviour or general molestation by someone who has previously been violent towards the applicant and/or any relevant children\nan occupation order, which can define or regulate rights of occupation of the home by the parties involved\nBreaches of non-molestation orders made by the family courts are classified as a criminal offence. It is not possible to compare across applications and orders, because they do not refer to the same cohort of cases.\nThe domestic violence disclosure scheme (DVDS, commonly known as Clare\u2019s Law2) was brought into effect in March 2014. The scheme has two routes:\n\u201cright to ask\u201d: this enables someone to ask the police about a partner\u2019s previous history of domestic violence or violent acts\n\u201cright to know\u201d: the police can proactively disclose information in prescribed circumstances\nEvery request under the DVDS is thoroughly checked by a panel made up of police, probation services and other agencies to ensure information is only passed on where it is deemed lawful, proportionate and necessary.\nIndividual processes in place across forces for considering and approving applications may vary. Trained police officers and advisers are then on hand to support victims through the difficult and sometimes dangerous transitional period.\nDVPOs and DVPNs were introduced across all 43 police forces in England and Wales on 8 March 2014. A DVPO is a civil order that provides protection to victims by enabling the police and magistrates\u2019 courts to put in place protective measures in the immediate aftermath of a domestic violence incident. A DVPO is often used where there is insufficient evidence to charge a perpetrator and provide protection to a victim via bail conditions.\nA DVPN is the initial notice issued by the police to provide emergency protection to an individual believed to be the victim of domestic violence. This notice, which must be authorised by a police superintendent, contains prohibitions that effectively prevent the suspected perpetrator from returning to the victim\u2019s home or otherwise contacting the victim. A DVPN may be issued to a person aged 18 years and over if the police superintendent has reasonable grounds for believing that:\nA DVPO can prevent the perpetrator from returning to a residence and from having contact with the victim for up to 28 days. An application for a DVPO by the police to a magistrates\u2019 court should be completed within 48 hours of the DVPN being served on the perpetrator. \nData are included in the release on the number of DVPOs and DVPNs which are applied for, and the number which are granted3. DVPOs are granted by a magistrate, whereas DVPNs can be approved by a police superintendent; this may explain any disparity seen between the approval of DVPNs and DVPOs.\nA defendant who appears before both magistrates\u2019 court and Crown Court may not do so within the same year, meaning for a given year convictions may exceed prosecutions or sentences may not equal convictions. Defendants who appear before both courts may be convicted at the Crown Court for a different offence to that for which they were originally proceeded against at magistrates\u2019 court.\nThis initiative was named after Clare Wood who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009, who unbeknown to her had a record of violence against women.\nNot all forces are able to provide data on the number of DVPOs and DVPNs which are applied for, and the number which are granted.\nIt is important to note that the data collected and reported throughout the release are not directly comparable between stages. This is because they are collected on different bases (for example, victims, crimes, suspects or defendants) and may not cover the same cohort because of variation in the time taken for cases to progress through the system. \nStatistics on domestic abuse are produced separately by a number of different organisations in England and Wales. When taken in isolation, these statistics may not provide the context required by users to enable them to understand the national and local picture of domestic abuse.\nAlthough these datasets are not directly comparable, bringing the data together in the Domestic abuse and the criminal justice system publication allows us to provide a picture of the level of attrition through the criminal justice system. \nData from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) should not be viewed in isolation. The estimates from the survey show a higher level of domestic abuse, in terms of the number of victims, than other data sources. They also show that many victims will not report the abuse they have experienced to the police. Therefore, while the CSEW provides the best available estimate of trends in the prevalence of domestic abuse, they may not match trends in administrative data sources. The CSEW cannot be used to make any inferences about demands on the police, the criminal justice system\u2019s response to perpetrators, or service provision.\nMany incidents of domestic abuse do not come to the attention of the police, which is why the estimated number of victims can be higher than the number of police recorded incidents and crimes. Of those incidents that are recorded, many will fall short of notifiable offences and are therefore not recorded as crimes. \nChanges seen in police recorded crime data can be affected by a range of different practices, including police forces improving their identification and recording of domestic abuse incidents as crimes, and an increased willingness by victims to come forward and report these crimes. As such, data held by the police can only provide a partial picture of the actual level of domestic abuse experienced. \nIt is necessary to look at the data presented in this release in its entirety since each individual stage of the system is, in part, influenced by activity at a prior stage. In particular, improving the police\u2019s ability to investigate, solve, and support the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in prosecuting domestic abuse cases is dependent upon understanding and improving many elements of domestic abuse investigations. \nFurthermore, cases may drop out at any stage of the process. The different datasets included in this release do not relate to the same cases given the different timescales and reference periods used to collect the data. Data can be based on offences, victims, suspects or defendants and can also vary in the way that cases are identified. \nThese factors, together with the time lag between the stages in the criminal justice process, mean that data discussed at each stage of the criminal justice process do not refer to the same cohort of cases and so direct comparisons cannot be made across sources1. Throughout the release, caveats are provided to make it clear where a comparison can be made and where it may be more difficult or not possible to directly compare data sources.\nThe taking or keeping of a person in custody by legal authority, especially in response to a criminal charge.\nPre-charge bail is the temporary release of a person while further investigations are conducted or more evidence is sought. Post-charge bail is the temporary release of an accused person while awaiting trial.\nCases where the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s decision was to charge.\nDomestic abuse police incidents and domestic abuse-related crimes combined, providing the total demand on police. This is used to calculate a combined incident and crime rate for domestic abuse and the proportion of domestic abuse incidents that were recorded as crimes.\nControlling behaviour is a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their resources and capacities for personal gain, depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance and escape, and regulating their everyday behaviour. Coercive behaviour is a continuing act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish or frighten their victim.\nCases where the defendant was convicted following a prosecution, comprising: \nIncidents of domestic abuse that resulted in a crime being recorded by the police and are included in police recorded crime. These can also be referred to as domestic abuse-related offences. Domestic abuse-related crimes can be added to domestic abuse incidents to create a total picture of the demand that domestic abuse puts on the police.\nIncidents of domestic abuse that were reported to the police, but following investigation, do not amount to a crime or offence according to the National Crime Recording Standards. These can be added to domestic abuse-related crimes to create a total picture of the demand that domestic abuse puts on the police.\nAny homicide where the relationship between the victim (aged 16 years or over) and the perpetrator falls into one of the following categories: \nThese schemes give members of the public a formal mechanism to make enquiries about an individual who they are in a relationship with, or who is in a relationship with someone they know, where there is a concern that the individual may be violent towards their partner. The scheme has two routes: \nThe initial notice issued by the police to provide emergency protection to an individual believed to be the victim of domestic violence. This notice, which must be authorised by a police superintendent, contains prohibitions that effectively prevent the suspected perpetrator from returning to the victim\u2019s home or otherwise contacting the victim.\nThis response can prevent the perpetrator from returning to a residence and from having contact with the victim for up to 28 days. \nAn IDVA is a professionally qualified, specialist domestic abuse worker, who supports high-risk victims of domestic abuse. High-risk cases are determined using the Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Honour-Based Violence (DASH) Risk Identification Checklist, professional judgement and where repeat incidents are occurring. \nA MARAC is a meeting where information is shared on the highest-risk domestic abuse cases between representatives of local police, health, child protection, housing practitioners, independent domestic violence advisors, probation and other specialists from the statutory and voluntary sectors. \nCases where the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s decision was not to prosecute, for evidential or public interest reasons.\nThe outcomes of all completed prosecutions where the defendant was not convicted, comprising the following: \nCases where the outcome of the charging decision has not been recorded or is undefined. \nCases where a caution, conditional caution, reprimand or final warning has been given or where the offence has been taken into consideration in relation to other charges. \nThese data are based on the full outcomes framework introduced in April 2014. This new outcomes framework allows every crime recorded by the police to be given a detailed outcome, showing how the police deal with crimes (including crimes that are still under investigation).\nCases where the defendant has been charged may be administratively finalised at the prosecution stage. Post-charge administrative finalisation may occur when prosecution cannot proceed because a defendant has failed to appear at court and a Bench Warrant has been issued for his or her arrest, or the defendant has died, or is found unfit to plead, or where proceedings are adjourned indefinitely. If the police trace a missing defendant then proceedings can continue.\nDecisions recorded as Pending response \u2013 further investigation (formally known as Administrative finalisations) are finalised in the CPS Case Management System for administrative reasons following any further requests of the investigating authority. These are not legal decisions and may not be the end of the case. Reasons for pre-charge pending response \u2013 further investigation finalisation include: \nthe CPS have asked the police to provide further information where there is insufficient evidence to make a charging decision, or the police are requesting early investigative advice. If the police do not respond within three months, following reminders, the case is closed on the Case Management System (CMS)\nthe CPS have advised the police to charge but the suspect has not been charged because the suspect has not answered police bail or cannot be located \ncases where a file submission has been rejected at triage because items are missing, and the police have been asked to supply the additional material and have not responded to reminders \nwhere the case has been returned to the police, with or without a lawyer\u2019s advice and/or actions, and the police decide to take no further action on the allegation \nthe suspect has died \nPending response \u2013 further investigation decisions are not legal decisions and may not be the end of the case. In some cases, for example, where the suspect is located or new information is provided the cases can be reopened and, if possible, a charging decision can be made.\nOf all the suspects referred by the police, pre-charge decisions are those where the CPS has completed making a decision on whether to charge, take no further action, recommend an out of court decision, record and outcome of pending response \u2013 further investigation or \u201cother\u201d.\nThe number of suspects referred by the police to the CPS for a charging decision.\nThe percentage of people aged 16 to 74 years who reported they had experienced any form of domestic abuse in the last year in the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). This prevalence rate is used to produce estimates of the number of victims of domestic abuse, as reported in the CSEW. \nAll cases where the defendant(s) were charged, summonsed in court, or charged by way of a postal requisition during the period. This includes those proceeding to a trial or guilty plea, those discontinued and those which could not proceed.\nAll cases resulting in an outcome other than a conviction are allocated a reason explaining why the case failed. If more than one reason applies, the principal reason is selected.

Daily flight numbers for the UK alongside other countries are available in EUROCONTROL's dashboard. EUROCONTROL is a pan-European, civil-military organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation. Its Aviation Intelligence and Performance Review Unit provides independent collection and validation of air navigation services performance-related data and intelligence gathering.\nThe flights data include international arrivals and departures to and from the UK (including crown dependencies) and domestic UK flights, but exclude overflights (flights that pass over UK territory). They capture all flight movements that operate under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), where the pilot uses instruments in the flight deck to control, guide and adjust the plane. This includes commercial flights carrying passengers and cargo as well as non-commercial flights such as private and military flights.\nData from EUROCONTROL do not include information on the volume of passengers or cargo carried on UK flights. Especially in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, flights might not be operating at full capacity and therefore trends in passengers and cargo will differ from trends in flights presented here.\nFigure 1: The seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,589 in the week ending 5 September 2021, a 5% increase from the previous weekNumber of daily flights, non-seasonally adjusted, and seven-day moving average, 2 January 2019 to 5 September 2021, UKSource: European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL)Notes:The fall in February 2020 coincides with Storm Ciara.The falls in December and January coincide with Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day.Download this chart Figure 1: The seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,589 in the week ending 5 September 2021, a 5% increase from the previous weekImage.csv.xls\nIn the week ending 5 September 2021, the seven-day average number of UK daily flights was 3,589, a 5% increase from the previous week (3,405) and a 15% increase from 3,111 the previous month (week ending 8 August 2021). This is the highest weekly average number of UK flights seen for almost 18 months (since 19 March 2020). \nThe seven-day average number of UK daily flights has increased by 151% from the week ending 23 May 2021, the week that international travel was allowed to restart and the UK government implemented the travel traffic light system (17 May 2021).\nThe average number of UK daily flights in the latest week was at 54% and 127% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019 and 2020, respectively. \nThe full data time series available for UK flights can be found in the accompanying dataset, which contains daily flight numbers and the rolling seven-day averages.\nThese data series are experimental faster indicators for estimating UK spending on credit and debit cards. They track the daily CHAPS payments made by credit and debit card payment processors to around 100 major UK retail corporates. These payments are the proceeds of recent credit and debit card transactions made by customers at their stores, both via physical and online platforms.\u202fMore information on the indicator is provided in the accompanying methodology article.\u202f \nCompanies are allocated to one of four categories based on their primary business: \u202f \nFigure 2 shows changes in the value of CHAPS payments received by large UK corporates from their credit and debit card processors, \"merchant acquirers\".\u202f \nIn the week to 2 September 2021, the CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases in aggregate increased by 6 percentage points from the previous week to 99% of its February 2020 average level.

Conversely, \u201cdelayable\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d spending were at 94% and 92% of their February 2020 average levels, respectively. \nIn August 2021, the monthly CHAPS-based indicator of aggregate credit and debit card spending was at 96% of its February 2020 average level, which is broadly unchanged from July 2021.\nThis is the fifth consecutive month that the monthly index has been greater than 90%, with September and December 2020 the only other times since March 2020 where this was the case.\nThe monthly data time series is available in the accompanying dataset and includes methodological notes that users should bear in mind. The monthly CHAPS index is calculated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), rather than being an additional series that is produced and validated by the Bank of England.\nThe new reporters index measures the number of UK firms sending Value Added Tax (VAT) returns to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for the first time, which is related to the number of business creations.\nFigure 3: There were 21,000 new VAT reporters in August 2021 \u2013 higher than August 2020 (17,730), but lower than August 2019 (21,490)Number of new firm reporters, January 2015 to August 2021, seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted, UKSource: HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)Download this chart Figure 3: There were 21,000 new VAT reporters in August 2021 \u2013 higher than August 2020 (17,730), but lower than August 2019 (21,490)Image.csv.xls\nThere were 21,000 new VAT reporters in the UK in August 2021, a decrease of 4% from 21,930 in July 2021. The number of new VAT reporters in August 2021 was 18% higher than in August 2020 (17,730) but 2% lower than August 2019 (21,490). This is also slightly higher than the 2015 to 2019 longer-term average (20,878).\nThe number of new reporters in the production industry rose by 13% from 970 in July 2021 to 1,100 in August 2021. In the services industry, there were 15,900 new VAT reporters in August 2021, a 7% decrease from the 17,140 reported in July 2021.\nThe figures explained in this section refer to seasonally adjusted data. Non-seasonally adjusted data are available in the accompanying dataset.\nTurnover diffusion indices are an aggregate measure used to track whether most firms are reporting an increase or decrease in turnover in their VAT returns. They are calculated as the percentage of firms with increasing turnover minus the percentage with decreasing turnover.\nThe heatmap in Figure 4 is a visual way of showing the VAT diffusion indices based on the standard deviation from their historical 2008 to 2019 average. Larger deviations are more darkly coloured, with red representing a negative change, while teal represents a positive change when compared with the previous period.\nThe month-on-month, all-industry turnover estimate for July 2021 shows that in the past month, out of 38,550 firms, more firms have reported decreasing rather than increasing turnover (net negative 3%). This is the largest negative net difference since April 2020, although it is important to note that these data are unweighted and we do not have information on the size of the changes reported.\nA net 6% of firms in the construction industry reported decreasing turnover in July 2021. This is the fifth consecutive month where more firms have reported decreasing turnover than increasing turnover in the construction industry. A net 4% and 2% of firms in the agriculture and production industries, respectively, reported decreasing turnover in July 2021. Meanwhile, in the services industry, an equal number of firms (net 0%) reported increasing turnover as those that reported decreasing turnover in the last month.\nThe figures explained in this section refer to seasonally adjusted data. Non-seasonally adjusted data are available in the accompanying dataset.\nOpenTable is a provider of data for online restaurant reservations, with daily data for the UK, London and Manchester being publicly available in its The state of the industry dashboard. These data show the impact of recent events and restrictions on the hospitality industry using a sample of restaurants on the OpenTable network across all channels, that is, online reservations, phone reservations, and walk-ins.\nFigure 5: The seven-day average estimate of UK seated diners saw a 28 percentage point week-on-week fall to 6 September 2021, and was 128% of the level in the equivalent week of 2019Seated diners, seven-day average, percentage compared with the equivalent week of 2019, week ending 24 February 2020 to week ending 6 September 2021, UK, London and ManchesterSource: OpenTableNotes:Data show the percentage of seated diners when compared with the same week in 2019.

However, this fall follows a week that included a bank holiday (30 August 2021) and is still notably higher than the comparable week in 2020, which was 92% of the equivalent week of 2019.\nIn the latest week, the seven-day average estimate of seated diners in Manchester fell by 47 percentage points to 130% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. During the same period, the equivalent figure for London was 81%, a decrease of 16 percentage points from the previous week. \nThe UK seven-day average estimate of seated diners has remained above the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019 since the week ending 17 May 2021 (following the reopening of indoor hospitality in England on 17 May 2021). In the period since this reopening to the latest week, the average estimate of UK seated diners was 132% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019.\nThese figures are experimental estimates of online job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, by category, by UK country and English region. The number of job adverts over time is an indicator of the demand for labour. The Adzuna categories used do not correspond to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories, so these values are not directly comparable with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Vacancy Survey.\nFurther category breakdowns are included in the \u202fonline job advert estimates dataset and more details on the methodology can be found in\u202fUsing Adzuna data to derive an indicator of weekly vacancies.\nUsers should note that week-on-week changes in online job advert volumes are outlined as percentages, rather than as percentage point changes. Percentage change figures quoted in the commentary will therefore not necessarily match the percentage point changes observed in the charts and accompanying dataset.\nAccording to Adzuna, on 3 September 2021, the total volume of online job adverts in the UK increased by 2% from the previous week (27 August 2021). \nOf the 28 categories, 15 saw a weekly increase in the number of online job adverts, 6 were unchanged, while the remaining 7 decreased when compared with the previous week. The largest weekly increase was in \u201clegal\u201d, which rose by 25%. This represents a recovery in the volume of online job adverts for \u201clegal\u201d after a significant dip throughout August 2021 and is now at similar levels to the end of July (30 July 2021). This seasonal pattern is consistent with previous years. The largest weekly fall was in \u201ceducation\u201d, which fell by 5%.\nThe total volume of online job adverts remained substantially above pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic volume, at 128% of its February 2020 average level. The \u201ctransport, logistics and warehouse\u201d category remained that with the highest amount of job adverts relative to its February 2020 average pre-pandemic level, at 326%.\nThere are only six categories that are now below pre-pandemic levels.

This is up from 9% in early August 2021. Businesses that reported difficulties filling vacancies in the last month compared with normal expectations were asked for the reasons for the difficulty. Approximately two in three (67%) of those businesses that are finding vacancies more difficult to fill than normal gave the reason of a lack of suitable applicants.\nFurther information can also be found in the Business insights and impact on the UK economy dataset.\nThis section includes some provisional results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) covering the period 25 August to 5 September 2021. The survey went out to 5,003 adults in Great Britain and had a response rate of 68% (3,387 responses). Further information to help understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain will be available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain, due to be updated on 10 September 2021.\nThe OPN has now moved to a fortnightly data collection. The same information as has been provided previously will be included within the fortnightly release.\nIn the period 25 August to 5 September 2021, the proportion of working adults in Great Britain who in the past seven days:\nOf the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so to shop for food and medicine increased slightly by 2 percentage points from the previous survey to 84%.\nThe proportion of these adults who shopped for things other than food and medicine in the last seven days was broadly unchanged from the previous survey at 46%.\nOf the 96% of adults in Great Britain who reported leaving home in the past seven days, the proportion that did so and reported wearing a face covering was broadly similar to the previous survey at 89%. Further breakdowns such as the situation when a face covering was worn (for example, while shopping) and by country, will be available in Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain due to be published on 10 September 2021.\nA changeover in the systems used to collect these data has introduced a level shift in the data time series from 14 June 2021 onwards, and users should not make comparisons between data before and after this date. The data produced prior to the change, for 1 April 2019 to 13 June 2021, can still be compared within that period.\nA full methodological review of our current method of data collection is underway and data may be subject to revision once this is complete.

This can also include where an existing business applies to become a limited company, where it was not one before. \nA voluntary dissolution application is when a company applies to begin dissolution proceedings. As such, they effectively chose to be removed from the Companies House register. For a company to be eligible to voluntarily dissolve, it should not have completed any trading activity for a period of three months. \nA new reporter is defined as a firm with a Value Added Tax (VAT) reference (that is, firm identification number), which has not previously reported its VAT returns. New reporters are published within one month of the end of the reporting period. The new reporting behaviour measure is classified by the month the data were received by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), known as the receipt date; this is not necessarily the same as the reference period (the period for which the VAT return is made).\nThe diffusion index tracks the growth in turnover and expenditure of firms. It is constructed to lie between negative 1 and 1. For example, if 65% of firms have increasing turnover, 30% have decreasing turnover and 5% turnover remains unchanged, then the diffusion index is 0.35.\nA full overview of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions for each of the four UK constituent countries can be found here:\nThese restrictions should be considered when interpreting the data featured throughout this bulletin.\nInformation on the strengths and limitations of the indicators in this bulletin is available in the Coronavirus and the latest indicators of the UK economy and society methodology.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) latest data and analysis  Webpage | Updated as and when data become available  Latest data on the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK and its effect on the economy and society.Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain: 27 August 2021 Bulletin | Released 27 August 2021  Latest indicators from the Opinions and Lifestyle SurveyDeaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional: 27 August 2021 Bulletin | Released 7 September 2021 Provisional counts of deaths registered in England and Wales, including deaths involving COVID-19, in the latest weeks for which data are available.Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 3 September 2021  Bulletin | Released 3 September 2021 Initial data from the COVID-19 Infection Survey (delivered in partnership with IQVIA, the University of Oxford and Lighthouse laboratories). \n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) latest data and analysis  Webpage | Updated as and when data become available  Latest data on the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK and its effect on the economy and society.\nCoronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain: 27 August 2021 Bulletin | Released 27 August 2021  Latest indicators from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey\nDeaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional: 27 August 2021 Bulletin | Released 7 September 2021 Provisional counts of deaths registered in England and Wales, including deaths involving COVID-19, in the latest weeks for which data are available.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, UK: 3 September 2021  Bulletin | Released 3 September 2021 Initial data from the COVID-19 Infection Survey (delivered in partnership with IQVIA, the University of Oxford and Lighthouse laboratories). \nAll content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated\n", "summary": "London sees the largest rise in online job adverts since March\nThe total volume of UK online job adverts on 3 September 2021 increased by 2% week-on-week, to 128% of the February 2020 average.\nThe \u201ctransport/logistics/warehouse\u201d category remains that with the highest amount of job adverts relative to its pre-pandemic level, at 326%.\nData for the total volume of online job adverts by category, 4 January 2019 to 3 September 2021 (XLXS, 31KB) \nOver the same period online job adverts in London and Northern Ireland both rose by 9%.
