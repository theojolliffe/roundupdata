Vaccination rates are lowest in younger age groups but are increasing. Across the four UK countries, the estimated percentage of adults aged 25 to 34 years who have received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccination ranged from 75.7% to 79.6%. This has increased sharply since the end of May 2021. </p><h4>Across all four UK countries, there is a clear pattern between vaccination and COVID-19 antibodies</h4><h5>Modelled percentage of adults testing positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, adults who have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine; and fully vaccinated adults, UK countries, 7 December 2020 to 20 June 2021</h5><p><div class=\"js--show\">\n",
